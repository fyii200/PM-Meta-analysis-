N2  - Importance: Despite persistent inequalities in access to eye care services globally, guidance on a set of recommended, evidence-based eye care interventions to support country health care planning has not been available. To overcome this barrier, the World Health Organization (WHO) Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI) has been developed. Objective(s): To describe the key outcomes of the PECI development. Evidence Review: A standardized stepwise approach that included the following stages: (1) selection of priority eye conditions by an expert panel after reviewing epidemiological evidence and health facility data; (2) identification of interventions and related evidence for the selected eye conditions from a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs); stage 2 included a systematic literature search, screening of title and abstracts (excluding articles that were not relevant CPGs), full-text review to assess disclosure of conflicts of interest and affiliations, quality appraisal, and data extraction; (3) expert review of the evidence extracted in stage 2, identification of missed interventions, and agreement on the inclusion of essential interventions suitable for implementation in low- and middle-income resource settings; and (4) peer review. Finding(s): Fifteen priority eye conditions were chosen. The literature search identified 3601 articles. Of these, 469 passed title and abstract screening, 151 passed full-text screening, 98 passed quality appraisal, and 87 were selected for data extraction. Little evidence (<=1 CPG identified) was available for pterygium, keratoconus, congenital eyelid disorders, vision rehabilitation, myopic macular degeneration, ptosis, entropion, and ectropion. In stage 3, domain-specific expert groups voted to include 135 interventions (57%) of a potential 235 interventions collated from stage 2. After synthesis across all interventions and eye conditions, 64 interventions (13 health promotion and education, 6 screening and prevention, 38 treatment, and 7 rehabilitation) were included in the PECI. Conclusions and Relevance: This systematic review of CPGs for priority eye conditions, followed by an expert consensus procedure, identified 64 essential, evidence-based, eye care interventions that are required to achieve universal eye health coverage. The review identified some important gaps, including a paucity of high-quality, English-language CPGs, for several eye diseases and a dearth of evidence-based recommendations on eye health promotion and prevention within existing CPGs.

N2  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied to the screening tasks of fundus diseases. However, few studies focused on the potential of AI to aid medical teaching in the residency training program. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the AI-based pathologic myopia (PM) identification system in the ophthalmology residency training program and assess the residents' feedback on this system. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety residents in the ophthalmology department at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University were randomly assigned to three groups. In group A, residents learned PM through an AI-based PM identification system. In group B and group C, residents learned PM through a traditional lecture given by two senior specialists independently. The improvement in resident performance was evaluated by comparing the pre-and post-lecture scores of a specifically designed test using a paired t-test. The difference among the three groups was evaluated by one-way ANOVA. Residents' evaluations of the AI-based PM identification system were measured by a 17-item questionnaire. Result(s): The post-lecture scores were significantly higher than the pre-lecture scores in group A (p < 0.0001). However, there was no difference between pre-and post-lecture scores in group B (p = 0.628) and group C (p = 0.158). Overall, all participants were satisfied and agreed that the AI-based PM identification system was effective and helpful to acquire PM identification, myopic maculopathy (MM) classification, and "Plus" lesion localization. Conclusion(s): It is still difficult for ophthalmic residents to promptly grasp the knowledge of identification of PM through a single traditional lecture, while the AI-based PM identification system effectively improved residents' performance in PM identification and received satisfactory feedback from residents. The application of the AI-based PM identification system showed advantages in promoting the efficiency of the ophthalmology residency training program.Copyright © 2022 Fang, Xu, He and Han.

N2  - Purpose: Retinopathy screening via digital imaging is promising for early detection and timely treatment, and tracking retinopathic abnormality over time can help to reveal the risk of disease progression. We developed an innovative physician-oriented artificial intelligence-facilitating diagnosis aid system for retinal diseases for screening multiple retinopathies and monitoring the regions of potential abnormality over time. Approach: Our dataset contains 4908 fundus images from 304 eyes with image-level annotations, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, cellophane maculopathy, pathological myopia, and healthy control (HC). The screening model utilized a VGG-based feature extractor and multiple-binary convolutional neural network-based classifiers. Images in time series were aligned via affine transforms estimated through speeded-up robust features. Heatmaps of retinopathy were generated from the feature extractor using gradient-weighted class activation mapping++, and individual candidate retinopathy sites were identified from the heatmaps using clustering algorithm. Nested cross-validation with a train-to-test split of 80% to 20% was used to evaluate the performance of the screening model. Result(s): Our screening model achieved 99% accuracy, 93% sensitivity, and 97% specificity in discriminating between patients with retinopathy and HCs. For discriminating between types of retinopathy, our model achieved an averaged performance of 80% accuracy, 78% sensitivity, 94% specificity, 79% F1-score, and Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.70. Moreover, visualization results were also shown to provide reasonable candidate sites of retinopathy. Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrated the capability of the proposed model for extracting diagnostic information of the abnormality and lesion locations, which allows clinicians to focus on patient-centered treatment and untangles the pathological plausibility hidden in deep learning models.

Y1  - 2022//
N2  - Purpose: To report distinct structural changes following surgery for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). Study design: A single-center, retrospective case series. Method(s): Patients with MTM who underwent vitrectomy and had persistent large intraretinal cavities and schisis were reviewed. The pre- and postoperative clinical findings and optical coherence tomography characteristics are described. Result(s): Five eyes of five patients were included in the study. Three patients had prominent schisis, and four had retinal/foveal detachment before surgery. All patients underwent fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane peeling during vitrectomy and had improved vision at 3 months after surgery. Large intraretinal cavities were noted on optical coherence tomography at the first postoperative exam in three patients and 12 to 18 months postoperation in the other two. The median height of the postoperative intraretinal cavities was 704 mum (range, 445-1287 mum). Inner retinal breaks were identified in all eyes, of which four were located in the paravascular area. The intraretinal cavity and schisis remained stable during the initial follow-up for an average of 35 months; later on, at > 5 years after the initial presentation two patients developed retinal detachment and one patient underwent vitrectomy with the retina reattached postoperatively. Conclusion(s): Large intraretinal cavities and schisis can be observed after MTM surgery, associated with paravascular inner breaks. The condition can progress after a long stable period; therefore, continuous follow-up is necessary.Copyright © 2022, Japanese Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - Purpose: To introduce a modified procedure of ICL implantation, to summarize the perioperative problems and their corresponding treatment after myopia correction with Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL), and to compare the difference of complications between the no-hole ICL and hole ICL. Method(s): We searched all articles on ICL-related perioperative problems and their corresponding treatment in Scopus, Embase, PubMed and Web of Science databases for the last 22 years. Result(s): ICL implantation is safe, effective, stable and predictable in the correction of myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism, but can also cause a series of perioperative problems, including intraoperative and postoperative complications. Conclusion(s): There are many kinds of complications related to ICL, but the common intraoperative and postoperative complications mainly include abnormality of arch height, abnormal position of ICL, loss of corneal endothelial cells and corneal decompensation, high intraocular pressure and secondary glaucoma, cataract and night vision symptoms. Compared with ICL without central pore, the incidence of complications such as loss of corneal endothelial cells and corneal decompensation, high intraocular pressure and secondary glaucoma and cataract was relatively lower in central hole ICL, while postoperative complications such as night vision symptoms were obvious.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - Nearsightedness (myopia) is a global health problem of staggering proportions that has driven the hunt for environmental and genetic risk factors in hopes of gaining insight into the underlying mechanism and providing new avenues of intervention. Myopia is the dominant risk factor for leading causes of blindness, including myopic maculopathy and retinal detachment. The fundamental defect in myopia-an excessively elongated eyeball-causes blurry distance vision that is correctable with lenses or surgery, but the risk of blindness remains. Haplotypes of the long-wavelength and middle-wavelength cone opsin genes (OPN1LW and OPN1MW, respectively) that exhibit profound exon-3 skipping during pre-messenger RNA splicing are associated with high myopia. Cone photoreceptors expressing these haplotypes are nearly devoid of photopigment. Conversely, cones in the same retina that express non-skipping haplotypes are relatively full of photopigment. We hypothesized that abnormal contrast signals arising from adjacent cones differ-ing in photopigment content stimulate axial elongation, and spectacles that reduce contrast may significantly slow myopia progression. We tested for an association between spherical equivalent refraction and OPN1LW haplotype in males of European ancestry as determined by long-distance PCR and Sanger sequencing and identified OPN1LW exon 3 haplotypes that increase the risk of common myopia. We also evaluated the effects of contrast-reducing spectacles lenses on myopia progression in children. The work presented here provides new insight into the cause and prevention of myopia progression.Copyright © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Purpose. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a major cause of vision loss in patients with diabetic retinopathy; this study is aimed at comparing the expression of aquaporins (AQPs) on the inner limiting membranes (ILMs) of various vitreoretinal diseases and investigating the role of aquaporins expressed on the ILMs in mediating the occurrence of DME. Methods. The whole-mounted ILM specimens surgically excised from patients with various vitreoretinal diseases (idiopathic macular hole, myopic traction maculopathy, and diabetic retinopathy) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The distribution and morphology of AQP4, AQP7, and AQP11 on the ILMs were correlated with immunohistochemical staining characteristics. Moreover, immunofluorescence of AQP4 was performed on the ILM specimens of the patient in four groups: the control group, negative control group, no DME group, and DME group. The immunofluorescence intensity value of AQP4 was measured using ImageJ. The difference between the four groups and the correction between the immunofluorescence value and central foveal thickness (CFT) were analyzed. Results. In IHC sections, the expression of AQP4, AQP7, and AQP11 on ILMs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) with macular edema, respectively, seemed to be more abundant than in the idiopathic macular hole (iMH) and myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). Moreover, markedly higher fluorescence intensity of AQP4 of ILMs was determined in the DME group (51.05+/-5.67) versus the other three groups (P<0.001). A marked positive association was identified between the fluorescence intensity of AQP4 and CFT (r=0.758; P=0.011). Conclusions. AQP4, AQP7, and AQP11 can be expressed on human ILM in vivo. The increased expression of AQPs on the ILMs of DR may be associated with the occurrence of DME. Moreover, the degree of DME may be positively correlated with the expression of AQP4 on the ILMs.Copyright © 2022 Yiqi Chen et al.

N2  - Myopia is a worldwide major public concern, aside from the visual disturbance needing optical correction, myopia may be associated with open angle glaucoma, retinal detachment and myopic maculopathy. The higher the myopia the higher the risk for retinal associated comorbidities, and the axial length is the more important measure to estimate risk of visual impairment. Recently a formula to predict axial length using spherical equivalent and keratometry was proposed, with the intention of categorizing the risk of visual impairment with Tideman et al. classification. Purpose(s): To evaluate the accuracy of an axial length prediction formula in a Colombian population 8-17 years old. Method(s): Children from MIOPUR study with optical biometer axial length measure (AL), manifest refraction and keratometry were included in the analysis. Predicted axial length (PAL) was calculated with the prediction formula. A Bland-Altman assessment was conducted, and the concordance correlation coefficient was measured. Proposed classification of AL to establish risk of visual loss was used with measured AL and with PAL. The percentage of eyes misclassified was then established. Result(s): A total of 2129 eyes were included in the analysis. Mean difference of axial length (actual AL minus PAL) was -0.516 mm (-1.559 mm - 0.528 mm). Concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.656 (IC95 0.636-0.675) was found between the real AL and PAL. PAL differed from measured AL by 1 mm or more in 16.58 %, and by 2 mm or more, in 0.61 % of the eyes. In myopic eyes, PAL was in average 0.426 mm longer than the AL actually measured with CCC of 0.714 (IC95 0.666-0.761). PAL differed from measured AL by 1 mm or more in 21.92 %, and by 2 mm or more, in 0.45 % of the myopic eyes. The study revealed that 15.03 % of all eyes, and 29.81 % of myopic eyes, were misclassified when PAL was used. Conclusion(s): The proposed axial length prediction formula was not accurate, and it did not adequately classify risk of visual impairment in myopic eyes in a group of Colombian children. We consider that it is not possible to predict the axial length based only on optometric data, such as the corneal radius of curvature and the spherical equivalent. This is very possibly related to the variability of crystalline lens power within a population.Copyright © 2021 British Contact Lens Association

N2  - Purpose: To assess predictive factors and surgical outcomes for myopic traction maculopathy. Method(s): This retrospective observational case study enrolled 73 patients who underwent vitrectomy for myopic traction maculopathy. The 79 eyes obtained from our study sample were divided into 4 types: Retinoschisis, lamellar macular hole (lamellar MH), foveal retinal detachment (FRD), and FRD + lamellar MH, or into 2 types according to the presence of FRD preoperatively. Dependent variables of interest were age, sex, pre- and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 6 months, and axial length. Result(s): All the four types showed moderately strong-to-strong positive correlations with pre- and postoperative BCVA (retinochisisi: R = 0.61; lamellar MH: R = 0.62; FRD: R = 0.51; FRD + lamellar MH; r = 0.83). Preoperative BCVA was associated with postoperative BCVA (P , 0.0001), but age, axial length, and the types of preoperative foveal status were not. Eyes with FRD had significantly worse pre- and postoperative BCVA than eyes without FRD (P = 0.036 and P = 0.046, respectively). Postoperative full-thickness macular holes developed in 5.1% of cases and in all types but retinoschisis. Conclusion(s): Preoperative visual acuity and the presence of FRD should be considered for surgical indication of myopic traction maculopathy.Copyright © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - The aim of this study was to develop an eyewall curvature- and axial length (AxL)-based algorithm to automate detection (clinician-free) of staphyloma ridge and apex locations using ultrasound (US). Forty-six individuals (with emmetropia, high myopia or pathologic myopia) were enrolled in this study (AxL range: 22.3-39.3 mm), yielding 130 images in total. An intensity-based segmentation algorithm automatically tracked the posterior eyewall, calculating the posterior eyewall local curvature (K) and distance (L) to the transducer and the location of the staphyloma apex. By use of the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve to evaluate the diagnostic ability of eight local statistics derived from K, L and AxL, the algorithm successfully quantified non-uniformity of eye shape with an AUROC > 0.70 for most K-based parameters. The performance of binary classification (staphyloma absence vs. presence) was assessed with the best classifier (the combination of AxL, standard deviation of K and standard deviation of L) yielding a diagnostic validation performance of 0.897, which was comparable to the diagnostic performance of junior clinicians. The staphyloma apex was localized with an average error of 1.35 +/- 1.34 mm. Combined with the real-time data acquisition capabilities of US, this method can be employed as a screening tool for clinician-free in vivo staphyloma detection.Copyright © 2022 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Myopic macular neovascularization (MNV) is the most common cause of a reduction of central vision in eyes with pathologic myopia, and it can progress to macular atrophy in the long-term. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with the development of MNVs. METHOD(S): There were 17,198 follow-up records from 5,409 eyes of 2,784 highly myopic patients that were reviewed. The general information and ophthalmic information in the records were studied. The significance of the correlations of factors associated with the development and predicting the development of myopic MNV were determined. RESULT(S): Being a woman (odds ratio [OR]: 0.727, P<0.001), having a longer axial length (OR = 0.948, P<0.001), a poorer baseline best-correct visual acuity (BCVA, OR = 2.098, P<0.001), having severe myopic maculopathy (overall: P<0.001), prior myopic MNV in the fellow eye (OR = 4.105, P<0.001), presence of patchy atrophy (overall P<0.001), lacquer cracks (OR = 1.718, P<0.001), prior foveal retinal detachment (RD, OR = 3.269, P<0.001), prior macular hole (MH, OR = 0.641, P <0.001), prior macular retinoschisis (OR = 1.533, P<0.001), and prior macular edema (OR = 1.508, P<0.001) were significantly correlated with the development of myopic MNV. Eyes with MNV and patchy atrophy would require an intensive follow-up examination for myopic patients as the fellow eye would have a risk of >70% for the development of myopic MNV in 3-years and nearly 80% in 5-years. CONCLUSION(S): Clinicians need to pay special attention to eyes with severe grades of myopic maculopathy, prior myopic MNV in the fellow eye, presence of patchy atrophy, and prior foveal retinal detachment to determine the onset of myopic MNV.Copyright The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: We aim to develop a multi-task three-dimensional (3D) deep learning (DL) model to detect glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) and myopic features (MF) simultaneously from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) volumetric scans. Method(s): Each volumetric scan was labelled as GON according to the criteria of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thinning, with a structural defect that correlated in position with the visual field defect (i.e., reference standard). MF were graded by the SDOCT en face images, defined as presence of peripapillary atrophy (PPA), optic disc tilting, or fundus tessellation. The multi-task DL model was developed by ResNet with output of Yes/No GON and Yes/No MF. SDOCT scans were collected in a tertiary eye hospital (Hong Kong SAR, China) for training (80%), tuning (10%), and internal validation (10%). External testing was performed on five independent datasets from eye centres in Hong Kong, the United States, and Singapore, respectively. For GON detection, we compared the model to the average RNFL thickness measurement generated from the SDOCT device. To investigate whether MF can affect the model's performance on GON detection, we conducted subgroup analyses in groups stratified by Yes/No MF. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were reported. Result(s): A total of 8,151 SDOCT volumetric scans from 3,609 eyes were collected. For detecting GON, in the internal validation, the proposed 3D model had significantly higher AUROC (0.949 vs. 0.913, p < 0.001) than average RNFL thickness in discriminating GON from normal. In the external testing, the two approaches had comparable performance. In the subgroup analysis, the multi-task DL model performed significantly better in the group of "no MF" (0.883 vs. 0.965, p-value < 0.001) in one external testing dataset, but no significant difference in internal validation and other external testing datasets. The multi-task DL model's performance to detect MF was also generalizable in all datasets, with the AUROC values ranging from 0.855 to 0.896. Conclusion(s): The proposed multi-task 3D DL model demonstrated high generalizability in all the datasets and the presence of MF did not affect the accuracy of GON detection generally.Copyright © 2022 Ran, Wang, Chan, Chan, Yip, Young, Wong, Yung, Chang, Mannil, Tham, Cheng, Chen, Li, Zhang, Heng, Tham and Cheung.

N2  - Background: To investigate the features in the posterior pole of highly myopic (HM) eyes using a wide-field high-resolution swept source optical coherence tomography (SS OCT). Method(s): This observational cross-sectional study involved 262 eyes of 139 patients, who were diagnosed as HM and had consecutively been examined by SS OCT in the Ophthalmology Department of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital between March 2019 and December 2019. The characteristics of OCT images were documented and analyzed. Result(s): In our study, SS OCT could demonstrate the entire layer of the choroid and detect the sclera in all eyes. The mean subfoveal retinal/choroidal/scleral thickness were 204.84 +/- 119.86 mum, 92.80 +/- 75.78 mum and 394.734 +/- 123.09 mum, respectively. 138 eyes (52.67%) had posterior precortical vitreous pocket. Myopic foveoschisis was detected in 110 eyes (41.98%), and significantly associated with the presence of posterior staphyloma. 36 eyes (13.74%) had DSM in our study, of which 8 eyes (22.22%) showed a round dome, 16 (44.44%) were horizontal oval-shaped, 9 (25%) were vertical oval-shaped and 3 (8.34%) were oblique oval-shaped. Both SFCT and SFST were inversely and significantly associated with age and refractive errors. Macular neovascularization was significantly correlated with intrascleral vessels. Different deformation of the sclera and posterior staphyloma were vividly identified on SS OCT images. Conclusion(s): This study provided a relatively comprehensive picture of posterior pole in HM eyes. Such good visualization of ocular fundus provided by wide-field SS OCT could be useful for the therapy option, disease condition monitoring and pathogenesis investigation.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the impact of posterior staphyloma identified using ultra-widefield fundus imaging on the long-term progression of myopic maculopathy in highly myopic patients. Method(s): In this observational cohort study, highly myopic patients who were followed up for at least 5 years using ultra-widefield fundus imaging were analysed for fundus abnormalities and the progression of myopic maculopathy based on the International Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia classification. Result(s): This study included 390 eyes (210 patients) with the mean follow-up period of 69.2 +/- 7.5 months (range, 60-88). Posterior staphyloma was identified in 198 eyes (50.8%) in the baseline ultra-widefield fundus images. The border of staphyloma was not identified within 50degree view circle corresponding to conventional fundus photography in 42 eyes (21.2%) with staphyloma, most of that were wide macular type. Progression of myopic maculopathy during follow-up was observed in 202 eyes (51.8%), and eyes with staphyloma were more likely to show progression compared to those without (142/198 [71.7%] versus 60/192 [31.3%]; p < 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, the presence of posterior staphyloma was an independent risk factor for the progression of myopic maculopathy (p = 0.005). One or more peripheral retinal lesions were observed in 302 eyes (77.4%) and 321 eyes (82.3%) in the baseline and final ultra-widefield fundus images, respectively. Conclusion(s): Posterior staphyloma was associated with the long-term progression of myopic maculopathy. With a wider field of view, ultra-widefield fundus imaging is useful for identifying the posterior staphyloma and monitoring the progression of myopic maculopathy in highly myopic patients.Copyright © 2021 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - Myopia is a prevalent yet confusingocular disorder. Myopia,formerlyconsidered abenignrefractivecondition, is nowassociatedwithanincreasedriskofdevelopingseveraloculardisorders,evenatmodestlevels.Myopiaisaglobalproblemthatexpe rts have documented. Despite the fact that the specific cause of myopia remains a mystery, it appears to be a combinationof genetic and environmental factors, making the prevention and treatment of the condition difficult and highly personalised.Myopia can have a positive impact on both the quality of life and the health of the eyes if it is prevented. Progressive additionlenses (PAL), topical atropine, ortho-k (orthokeratology) lenses and multifocal contact lenses are some of the most commoncontrol options currently available. Myopia has gained prominence in optometry studies as a result of its high prevalence. It ismore common for children to suffer from problems, such as extreme myopia and myopic macular degeneration, if they begindevelopingmyopiaatanearlyage.Thepurposeofthisstudywillbetoconductaninquiryintotheepidemiologyandriskfactorsfor myopiainschool-agedchildren(aged 6-19years)aroundtheworld.Copyright © 2022, Anka Publishers.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the risk factors for the progression of myopic maculopathy (MM) based on severity. METHOD(S): In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature published before December 2020 on the risk factors for the progression of MM in patients with pathologic myopia (PM) and high myopia (HM). Odds ratios (ORs) for different stages of myopic maculopathy categorized based on the International Meta-Analysis for PM (META-PM) classification were calculated using fixed and random effects models. RESULT(S): A total of 12,070 affected eyes derived from 5 cohort studies were included in the systematic review. The presence of PM at baseline was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of MM progression (pooled ORs: 7.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.29-15.6), and the greater category of MM at baseline was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of MM progression, that is, eyes with MM category 3 or more compared with eyes with MM category 2 (pooled OR: 10.95, 95% CI: 6.07-19.76) and eyes with MM category 4 compared with eyes with MM category 3 (pooled ORs: 2.45, 95% CI: 0.28-21.37). CONCLUSION(S): The findings in this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that the progression of MM is associated with more severe MM at baseline.Copyright © 2022 Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists.

N2  - PURPOSE: Considering that a certain proportion of high myopes have reduced visual acuity even after full optical correction, this study aimed to investigate the association between various refractive error components (sphere, cylinder and axis orientation) and reduced visual acuity in individuals with low to high myopia with and without pathologic myopia lesions. METHOD(S): We analysed data from randomly selected eyes of 11,258 individuals with myopia (mean+/-SD spherical equivalent (SE) -3.2 +/-2.9D; range: -0.5D to -21.5D). In total, 10,528 individuals had no pathologic myopia lesions. Sphere, cylinder and SE refraction were classified into mild, moderate and high categories. Astigmatism was defined as with-the-rule, against-the-rule or oblique based on the axis orientation. Reduced best-corrected visual acuity was defined as >=0.18 logMAR. Logistic regression was performed to test factors associated with reduced visual acuity with and without pathologic myopia lesions. RESULT(S): Overall, 6.4% (N =720/11,258) of myopes had reduced best-corrected visual acuity. High sphere (<=-6.0D; Odd ratios [OR]: 16.1; 95% CI: 2.1-126.5), high cylinder (<-2.0 DC; OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.8-3.4), against-the-rule (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0) and oblique astigmatism (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.1) were significantly (p <=0.008) associated with reduced visual acuity in the absence of pathologic myopia lesions. Both moderate SE and high myopic SE were also associated with reduced visual acuity. In the presence of pathologic myopia lesions, tessellated fundus (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 3.5-14.1), chorioretinal atrophy (OR: 7.7; 95% CI: 2.6-19.9) and choroidal neovascularisation (OR: 37.4; 95% CI: 3.3-419.3) were significantly (p <=0.003) associated with reduced visual acuity. CONCLUSION(S): Even after full optical correction, both refractive components and pathologic myopia lesions can independently cause reduced visual acuity, regardless of the degree of myopia.Copyright © 2022 College of Optometrists.

N2  - Introduction: This study compared the surgical outcomes in eyes with myopic foveoschisis (MF) according to the recently developed ATN classification system. Method(s): This was an observational case series of 64 consecutive eyes that underwent vitrectomy for MF. Eyes were classified into severe myopic maculopathy (MM) (n = 43) and non-severe MM (n = 21) groups according to the ATN classification system. The primary outcome measures constituted best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and anatomical changes. Result(s): In total, BCVA improved from 0.97 to 0.53 (P < 0.001) after surgery. The ATN score was significantly lower in the eyes with vision improvement than those without vision improvement (P < 0.001). In the subgroup, BCVA improved from 0.79 to 0.28 in the non-severe MM group (P < 0.001), and improved from 1.05 to 0.65 in the severe MM group (P = 0.001) after surgery. The non-severe MM group achieved better postoperative BCVA (P = 0.001) and were more likely to gain vision improvement (P < 0.001) after surgery compared with the severe MM group. Anatomical success was achieved in 62 of the 64 eyes (96.88%). Two eyes with anatomical failure developed full-thickness macular holes postoperatively; both were in the severe MM group. Conclusion(s): For patients with MF, different severity of MM based on ATN classification could lead to a significantly different prognosis after surgery. For patients with high ATN scores, the operative decision should be made cautiously for the worse anatomical and visual prognosis. ATN system is instructive in making operative proposals for MF.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - Cone photoreceptor dysfunction represents a clinically heterogenous group of disorders characterized by nystagmus, photophobia, reduced central or color vision, and macular dystrophy. Here, we described the molecular findings and clinical manifestations of achromatopsia, a partial or total absence of color vision, co-segregating with three known missense variants of CNGA3 in three large consanguineous Pakistani families. Fundus examination and optical coherence tomog-raphy (OCT) imaging revealed myopia, thin retina, retinal pigment epithelial cells loss at fovea/peri-fovea, and macular atrophy. Combination of Sanger and whole exome sequencing revealed three known homozygous missense variants (c.827A>G, p.(Asn276Ser); c.847C>T, p.(Arg283Trp); c.1279C>T, p.(Arg427Cys)) in CNGA3, the alpha-subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel in cone photoreceptor cells. All three variants are predicted to replace evolutionary conserved amino acids, and to be pathogenic by specific in silico programs, consistent with the observed altered membrane targeting of CNGA3 in heterologous cells. Insights from our study will facilitate counseling regarding the molecular and phenotypic landscape of CNGA3-related cone dystrophies.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: To apply deep learning (DL) techniques to develop an automatic intelligent classification system identifying the specific types of myopic maculopathy (MM) based on macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using transfer learning (TL). Method(s): In this retrospective study, a total of 3,945 macular OCT images from 2,866 myopic patients were recruited from the ophthalmic outpatients of three hospitals. After culling out 545 images with poor quality, a dataset containing 3,400 macular OCT images was manually classified according to the ATN system, containing four types of MM with high OCT diagnostic values. Two DL classification algorithms were trained to identify the targeted lesion categories: Algorithm A was trained from scratch, and algorithm B using the TL approach initiated from the classification algorithm developed in our previous study. After comparing the training process, the algorithm with better performance was tested and validated. The performance of the classification algorithm in the test and validation sets was evaluated using metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, quadratic-weighted kappa score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Moreover, the human-machine comparison was conducted. To better evaluate the algorithm and clarify the optimization direction, the dimensionality reduction analysis and heat map analysis were also used to visually analyze the algorithm. Result(s): Algorithm B showed better performance in the training process. In the test set, the algorithm B achieved relatively robust performance with macro AUC, accuracy, and quadratic-weighted kappa of 0.986, 96.04% (95% CI: 0.951, 0.969), and 0.940 (95% CI: 0.909-0.971), respectively. In the external validation set, the performance of algorithm B was slightly inferior to that in the test set. In human-machine comparison test, the algorithm indicators were inferior to the retinal specialists but were the same as the ordinary ophthalmologists. In addition, dimensionality reduction visualization and heatmap visualization analysis showed excellent performance of the algorithm. Conclusion(s): Our macular OCT image classification algorithm developed using the TL approach exhibited excellent performance. The automatic diagnosis system for macular OCT images of MM based on DL showed potential application prospects.Copyright © 2022 He, Ren, Lu, Tang, Wang, Yang and Han.

N2  - Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM), one of the complications of pathologic myopia, is a spectrum of pathological conditions that are attributed to tractional changes in the eye characterized by retinoschisis, lamellar or full thickness macular hole, and foveal retinal detachment. Considering the global public health burden of MTM and pathologic myopia, it is important to understand these sight-threatening complications and their associations. We conducted an evidence-based review of the prevalence and natural history of MTM and associated risk factors. The prevalence of MTM in the general population is low, but is increased among high myopes. MTM is associated with preretinal tractional structures, myopic refractive error and axial elongation, posterior staphyloma, dome-shaped macula, chorioretinal atrophy, and myopic macular degeneration. The clinical course of MTM tends to be stable; however, MTM may progress, resulting in visual acuity deterioration, although spontaneous improvement also occurs. The associations of MTM progression include vitreous traction, location, and extent of MTM, and lamellar macular hole-specific factors. More high-quality population-based studies that assess MTM prevalence and natural history are needed.Copyright © 2022

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study is to systematically review the evidence for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in choroidal neovascularisation secondary to conditions other than age-related macular degeneration. Data sources: MEDLINE, MEDLINE in-process, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases and conference abstracts were searched (from inception to Jan 2014). Study eligibility criteria, participants and interventions: Randomised and non-randomised comparative studies with follow-up of at least 6 months were included and were used to assess clinical effectiveness. Study appraisal and synthesis method: Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was not possible due to methodological heterogeneity. Result(s): 16 studies met the inclusion criteria (1091 eyes; 963 pathological myopia, 74 other conditions). There was large variation in risk of bias across studies. An improvement in best-corrected visual acuity in anti-VEGF arms over comparators was reported in all studies. The proportion of patients improving by at least 15 letters in anti-VEGF arms ranged from 27.3% to 70%. There were no significant differences between bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Limitation(s): Owing to the rarity of choroidal neovascularisation secondary to conditions other than age-related macular degeneration or pathological myopia, there are unlikely to ever be sufficiently powered trials in these populations. Conclusion(s): Bevacizumab and ranibizumab appear to be effective in improving visual acuity for patients with choroidal neovascularisation secondary to conditions other than age-related macular degeneration. The evidence base is strongest for choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathological myopia, however, based on current evidence and likely pharmacological pathways, clinicians should consider treatment with either bevacizumab or ranibizumab for rarer causes.Copyright © 2015 BMJ Publishing Group.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the factors associated with the recurrence of pathologic myopia choroidal neovascularization (PM-CNV). Method(s): Forty-eight eyes of 48 patients with PM-CNV treated with conbercept at least 6 months of follow-up were included. Appearance of ellipsoid zone (EZ) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) observed on optical coherence tomography (OCT). Hyperreflective foci (HRF) height measured on OCT. Observation of CNV shape on OCT-angiography (OCTA). PM-CNV area measured on OCTA. To observe relationship between these factors and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and PM-CNV recurrence. Result(s): The 48 patients (48 eyes) with PM-CNV were divided into two groups: yielding a group of 20 eyes with type 1 and a group of 28 eyes with type 2. The BCVA of type 1 was better than type 2 before and after treatment (P < 0.005). Smaller HRF height (P < 0.001) and CNV area (P < 0.001) for type 1 than type 2. The appearance of EZ and RPE were intact (P < 0.001). Spearman correlation analysis found that final BCVA was significantly associated with baseline BCVA, HRF height, and appearance of EZ (P < 0.05). Binary logistics regression analysis revealed that PM-CNV recurrence was significantly correlated not only HRF height and CNV area, but also with appearance of EZ, and RPE (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): PM-CNV had a higher recurrence ratio. Baseline BCVA and clinical features play an important role for vision prognosis. Factors associated with PM-CNV recurrence include HRF height, CNV area, and changes in EZ and RPE structure.Copyright © 2022 Jing, Bo, Gao and Wang.

N2  - Purpose The study aimed to evaluate risk factors for macular atrophy (MA) associated with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) during long-term follow-up after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in highly myopic eyes. Methods The medical records of patients who received intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents as mCNV treatment and were followed-up for more than 36 months were retrospectively reviewed. The risk factors for the development of mCNV-MA, which is the fovea-involving patchy atrophy lesion adjacent to mCNV, were investigated using the Cox proportional hazard model. Results A total of 82 eyes (74 patients) were included in the study. The mean age at anti-VEGF treatment was 56.3 +/- 12.5 years (range, 26-77), and the mean follow-up period was 76.3 +/- 33.5 months (range, 36-154). During follow-up, mCNV-MA developed in 27 eyes (32.9%), and its occurrence was estimated to be 24.5% at 3 years and 37.3% at 5 years after the first anti- VEGF treatment. Old age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.054, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.018- 1.091; P = 0.003) and greater CNV size at baseline (HR = 2.396, CI: 1.043-5.504; P = 0.040) were significant factors for mCNV-MA development. Eyes with a thinner subfoveal choroid were more likely to show faster enlargement of the mCNV-MA during follow-up. Conclusions In mCNV eyes treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, older age and greater mCNV size at baseline were risk factors for the development of MA during long-term follow-up, which was associated with a poor visual prognosis.Copyright © 2022 Bae et al.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to analyze the status of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by means of the spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) overlying the myopic neovascular lesions in the involutive phase, looking for any correlations between the status of the RPE and the size of the lesions and the type and duration of the treatment. Method(s): SD-OCT examinations of 83 consecutive patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) were reviewed and divided into two groups: group A, patients with CNV characterized by uniformity of the overlying RPE, and group B, patients with CNV characterized by non-uniformity of the overlying RPE. Result(s): The median lesion area, major diameter, and minimum diameter were, respectively, 0.42 mm2 (0.30-1.01 mm2), 0.76 mm2 (0.54-1.28 mm2), and 0.47 mm2 (0.63-0.77 mm2) in group A, and 1.60 mm2 (0.72-2.67 mm2), 1.76 mm2 (1.13-2.23 mm2), and 0.98 mm2 (0.65-1.33 mm2) in group B. These values were lower in group A than in group B (p < 0.001). The number of treatments with a period free of disease recurrence for at least 6 months was greater (p < 0.010) in group B (6.54 +/- 2.82) than in group A (3.67 +/- 2.08), and treatments include intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection, photodynamic therapy, or both. Conclusion(s): Our results showed that the size of myopic neovascular lesion influences the development of a uniform RPE above the lesion and therefore the disease prognosis. The presence of uniform RPE was found to be extremely important in the follow-up of patients with myopic CNV, as it influences the duration of the disease and the number of treatments required.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) according to peripapillary atrophy (PPA) and optic disk tilt and to explore whether those myopic disk deformations are associated with the prognosis of mCNV. Method(s): Patients with subfoveal mCNV who received intravitreal bevacizumab injection and followed for >=3 years were included. PPA was quantified as area of the s-zone PPA/disk area ratio (PDR) and optic disk tilt as the tilt ratio (the longest/shortest disk diameter). We compared the clinical characteristics in terms of PDR and tilt ratio and identified the poor prognostic factors using Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard model. Result(s): Among 80 eyes of 80 patients, 29 (36.30%) eyes developed macular atrophy during 80.71 +/- 34.76 months. PDR and tilt ratio are strongly correlated with each other (P = 0.004). Higher PDR showed significant correlations with longer axial length (P = 0.013), worse baseline and final VA (P = 0.007 and P = 0.047), and thinner subfoveal choroidal thickness (P = 0.039), while higher tilt ratio showed significant correlations only with longer axial length (P = 0.036). High PDR was also an independent risk factor for both macular atrophy (OR = 2.257, P < 0.001) and poor visual outcome (HR = 1.174, P = 0.007), while high disk tilt ratio was not. Conclusion(s): Subfoveal mCNV with higher s-zone PPA area/disk area ratio had worse functional and structural outcomes.Copyright © 2022 Han, Kim, Yang, Moon, Lee, Kim and Yoon.

N2  - AIMS: To elucidate genetic background of early-onset high myopia (eoHM) and characteristics of ARR3-associated MYP26. METHOD(S): Variants in 14 genes reported to contribute to eoHM, including ARR3, were selected from exome sequencing data set and classified into different categories following American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines based on in silico prediction, associated phenotypes, confirmation and cosegregation analysis. The available clinical data of individuals were summarised. RESULT(S): Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in three of 14 genes were identified in 52 of 928 families with eoHM, including 29 in ARR3, 22 in OPN1LW and 1 in LRPAP1. For ARR3, 24 pathogenic variants (16 truncation and 8 missense) were identified in 66women and 12 men, in whom 64women and 4 men had eoHM by X-linked female-limited inheritance. Refraction ranged from -5.00 to -28.75 diopter (-12.58+/-4.83). Mild-to-moderately reduced cone responses were recorded in 76.9% (10/13) of patients with electroretinogram recordings. Most patients (75.9%, 41/54) had mild myopic fundus changes (C0 to C1). Genotype-phenotype analysis suggested that the myopic retinopathy degree was correlated with age and the variant's nature. Peripheral retinal degeneration was observed in 38.5% (5/13) patients using wide-field examinations. CONCLUSION(S): This study reveals ARR3 as the most frequently implicated gene for Mendelian eoHM. Truncations and highly scored missense variants in ARR3 are pathogenic. Myopia due to ARR3 mutations is transmitted in X-linked female-limited inheritance, manifests with mild cone impairment and slowly progresses to pathologic myopia. Identification of the most common cause for Mendelian eoHM provides a valuable starting point into the molecular mechanism of myopia.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

N2  - Purpose : Despite growing literature looking at factors that contribute to the closure of full-thickness macular holes, there are still gaps in our knowledge. This study sought to examine the role of preoperative and intraoperative factors in predicting anatomic and visual success of vitrectomy for full-thickness macular holes. Methods : A retrospective chart review of cases in year 2018-2019 was conducted at the University of Wisconsin. Inclusion criteria included vitrectomy for macular hole and preand post-operative imaging. Successful closure was defined as the absence of a fullthickness disruption by imaging. Final statistical analyses are currently underway. Data will be summarized using the median and inter quartile range (IQR; span from 25 to 75 percentile capturing central 50% of the sample) for continuous features or with th th frequencies and percentages for categorical factors. Risk factors associated with hole closure will be compared between groups using either rank-sum procedures or Fisher's exact tests. Analyses will be performed using R (ver. 4.0.3). Results : There were 138 subjects who met inclusion criteria and had vitrectomy for macular hole. One had a traumatic injury and was especially young (< 15 years old) at the time of repair; all others were between 42-87 years at time of surgery, with the mean age of 71.5. 69.5% of patients were female. Internal limiting membrane was peeled in all cases. Hole closure was successful for 126 subjects (90.5%); 120 (95%) of these had single surgery success. Age, lens status, prior hole repair, and chronicity (present > 1 year), pathologic myopia or staphyloma were included in data collection, among several other variables of interest. 6 (50%) of the unsuccessful surgeries were highly myopic patients and 11 of the total 17 (64.7%) highly myopic patients achieved successful closure. Mean minimum hole diameter (MHD) was 316.2 uM. A larger mean MHD was found among those who had an unsuccessful repair (598.2 uM). Mean preoperative logMAR visual acuity was 0.81 with mean improvement to 0.52 postoperatively. Conclusions : The study suggests that factors such as being highly myopic and large MHD may portend a decreased likelihood of a successful macular hole surgery, although final statistical analyses are pending.

N2  - Purpose : Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) improves the visual prognosis in myopic choroidal neovascularization at short term, but visual acuity (VA), recurrence rate, and second eye involvement at long-term remain unclear. We performed a longitudinal clinical study with real-world data to learn about the long-term outcomes of anti-VEGF in a large European cohort. Methods : Up to 12 years of longitudinal data from a tertiary hospital in the Netherlands (2008-2018) were analyzed. Patients with high myopia (spherical equivalent (SE) <=-6D), an active CNV lesion, European descent and no history of anti-VEGF treatment were monitored. A total of 98 eyes (mean SE -14 +/- 4D) of 87 patients (mean age 57+/-14 years) were included. Course of VA during follow-up, recurrence rate and second eye involvement were analyzed as outcomes. Change in VA during follow-up was compared using paired t-tests. Cox proportional hazard models tested the effect of the presence of chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) and lacquer cracks on mCNV recurrence or second eye involvement. Results : VA significantly improved after a median of 2 anti-VEGF injections (P<0.001). At 4 years, the improvement in VA disappeared (P=0.6) and continued to deteriorate (Figure 1). The average decrease of VA was 0.05 LogMar per year. The cumulative incidence of recurrent mCNV was 52% at 5 years after the first episode. VA in eyes with recurrent mCNV decreased at a similar rate (P=0.5). Diffuse CRA (HR 10.6 95% CI 2.2-51.3, P=0.003) and patchy CRA (HR 5.2 95% CI 1.2-22.0, P =0.027) were significant predictors for mCNV recurrence. In 22 (25%) patients, the fellow eye developed mCNV after an average of 5.7 years. Age <= 40 years at first onset of mCNV significantly increased the risk of bilateral mCNV (HR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-13.9, P=0.008). CRA and lacquer cracks in the fellow eye at baseline did not add significantly to the risk of mCNV in that eye. Conclusions : This large mCNV study revealed that VA improvement after IVB injections was not maintained at long-term. Recurrences occurred frequently but did not alter the already poor visual prognosis. We advise to closely monitor patients with mCNV since recurrences occur in more than 50%, and pay particular attention to patients younger than 40 years as they are at high risk of second eye involvement.

N2  - Purpose : Deep learning (DL) technology in recent studies has shown that automated screening, assisted diagnosis, and grading of retinal diseases using conventional fundus photographs (FPs) of about 50degree view angle are efficient in saving workforce and time. Compared to conventional FPs, wide-field (WF) images of true color can provide wider view with sufficient resolution, which might further improve the efficiency of screening and DL models, but have not been investigated. Therefore, we investigated the diagnostic performance of DL models for 8 common retinal conditions using fundus photographs captured using Zeiss Clarus 500, by adapting conventional FP models into WF images. Methods : We retrospectively analyzed 474 WF images from 197 consecutive volunteers with retinal conditions, including healthy condition, pathologic myopia, macular abnormalities, retinal vein occlusion, retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy, after laser photocoagulation treatment, and other abnormalities, which were diagnosed by a panel of retinal specialists. An image could be diagnosed with multiple conditions simultaneously. 258 images without any annotations were used to adjust DL models, and the other 216 images with annotations were used to test the models (Table 1). Considering that WF images show similar appearance in lesions and structures with conventional FPs, we have tried 3 different methods. A model pre-trained on conventional FPs was used to classify whole WF images, and splitted images from WF images, respectively. We also develop a novel method, Global-Local Consistency (GLC), to reach similar diagnostic result between whole and splitted WF images (Figure). Results : The GLC method was identified as the best diagnostic method for WF images with the highest mean AUC (area under the curve value, 0.8735 vs 0.8541-0.8613). This method was superior to previous models in all conditions except health conditions and retinal vein occlusion (Table 2). Conclusions : GLC method showed better diagnostic performance for common retinal conditions in this pilot study, even training with a relatively small sample size. Benefit from the similarity between the intrinsic feature of true color of Clarus images and CFPs, model pre-trained on CFPs can be directly used to predict WF images. Our GLC method combining with Clarus facilities might help improve the process of screening retinal diseases.

N2  - Purpose : To describe and compare macular neovascularization (MNV) associated with myopic macular degeneration (MMD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA). Methods : Adult patients with documented MNV were recruited in this cross-sectional study and imaged using 6 x 6 mm angiograms on SS-OCTA. Several qualitative and quantitative features of MNV were assessed, including the MNV area and vessel density (VD). Descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were carried out. Results : A total of 75 eyes with MNV, including 30 eyes with MMD-MNV and 45 eyes with AMD-MNV, were considered in this study. Mean subjects' age in each group was 55 +/- 19 years and 75 +/- 8 years respectively. The MMD-MNV group exhibited three-fold smaller sized MNV (p=0.001), lower greatest linear dimension (GLD) (p=0.009) and greatest vascular caliber (GVC) (p<0.001) compared to AMD-MNVs, and had a higher prevalence of tree-in-bud pattern. Eyes with AMD showed a higher prevalence of type 1 MNVs with medusa pattern, and tended to have better defined margins with the presence of peripheral loops. There was no difference in the location of the MNV, the shape's regularity, the presence of a core vessel, a capillary fringe or a perilesional dark halo between both conditions (all p>0.05). MMD-MNV presented a significantly high proportion (59%) of non-discernable MNV on SS-OCTA in our cohort. After adjustment, decreased MNV area and increased VD were associated with the tree-in-bud pattern, whereas the diagnosis did not significantly influence those parameters. Conclusions : This study is the first to describe and compare MMD-MNV and AMD-MNV using SS-OCTA, providing relevant insight on MNV secondary to MMD and AMD, and further validating OCTA as a powerful tool to detect and characterize MNV non-invasively.

N2  - Purpose : The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants associated with novel measures of the curvature of the posterior globe derived from macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans in a large UK-based cohort. Methods : A total of 73,032 participants from the UK Biobank study who underwent macular spectral-domain OCT as part of their ophthalmic examination were analysed. A deep learning model was used to segment the scans and polynomial fit was used to calculate the curvature of the macula and fovea. Genome-wide association analyses were performed on individuals of European ancestry using BOLT-LMM with adjustment for age, sex and population structure. Given that foveal curvature is highly dependent on retinal pathology individuals were excluded with diabetes or with ocular diagnoses affecting retinal thickness. Given that macula curvature, synonymous with dome-shaped macula configuration, is associated with myopia further analyses with adjustment for refractive error were performed. Results : Analyses were performed on 77,324 and 58,348 participants for macula and fovea curvature respectively. Genetic variants associated with macula curvature clustered at 37 unique autosomal genomic regions at genome-wide significance (P<5x10- 8) and the most significant locus was LAMA2 (p=3.40x10-49 This and several other loci were previously associated with refractive error and myopia. After adjustment for refractive error the most significant locus was DGKD (p=6.60x10-65). A larger number genome-wide significant variants were associated with fovea curvature (n=315) which clustered at 128 unique autosomal genomic regions including LINC00461 (p=5.50x10-76), ADCY5 (p= 5.90x10-73) and FLT1 (p= 9.90x10-27). Conclusions : This study has identified a large number of genetic loci influencing the curvature of the macula and fovea. The identified genetic determinants could provide additional insights into axial elongation, macula staphyloma (a risk factor for myopic maculopathy), dome-shape macula configuration and foveal development.

N2  - Purpose : Ultrasound is a commonly available tool to assess the properties of the posterior eye, allowing us to characterize morphological changes. Here, the present study investigates the use of curvature in a simple algorithm to achieve automated (clinician-free) staphyloma detection, as well as pinpoint the location of staphyloma apexes? locations known to be prone to pathologic change. Methods : 46 individuals (emmetropic, highly myopic (HM) or pathologic myopia) were enrolled in this study (axial length (AxL) range: 22.3-39.3mm) yielded 130 images in total. 10 MHz US B-scan images were acquired while subjects fixated in primary gaze. Eyes were clinically classified into two groups-a non-staphyloma group (composed of eyes that were either emmetropic or HM without staphyloma) and a staphyloma group. On each US image, an intensity-based segmentation algorithm automatically tracked the posterior eyewall. Local curvature (K) of the posterior eyewall and distance (L) of the posterior eyewall to the US transducer were calculated. The location of the staphyloma apex was also automatically estimated. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic ability of eight local statistics derived from K, L and AxL. The performance of binary classification (i.e. presence or absence of staphyloma) was assessed at an optimal cut-off point and compared with the performance of junior clinicians. Results : A fully-automated algorithm was able to detect the posterior eyewall and quantify the non-uniformity of the posterior eye shape with a good classification performance of AUROC > 0.70 for most parameters derived from local curvature (K). The best classifier (the combination of AxL, standard deviation of K, and the standard deviation of L) yielded a diagnostic validation performance of 0.897, which was comparable to the diagnostic performance of junior clinicians. Our method localized the staphyloma apex with an average error of 1.35+/-1.34 mm. Conclusions : Our fully-automated method enables staphyloma detection with performance comparable to that of junior clinicians. Combined with real-time data acquisition capabilities of US, this method has the potential to be employed as a screening tool for clinician-free in-vivo staphyloma detection.

N2  - Purpose : Recent studies have suggested that swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) may be superior to spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) in imaging eyes with pathological myopia. Here, we compare SD-OCT and SS-OCT optic nerve head (ONH) scans in highly myopic (HM) eyes, to determine if one modality is superior to the other in terms of the percentage of usable scans produced (perUSABLE), and if this difference in perUSABLE is correlated with axial length (AL) and the presence of myopic defects, such as staphyloma, peripapillary atrophy and myopic macular degeneration. Methods : 413 eyes from 212 patients with HM in at least 1 eye (AL 29.1 +/- 2.5 mm, range 22.8 to 35.8 mm) were scanned with SD-OCT (Cirrus) and SS-OCT (Triton). Metrics for the quality of each scan were acquired, namely signal strength (SS), centration and motion artifact. Usable scans were defined as having adequate SS (Cirrus: SS>=7; Triton: SS>=30), adequate centration and lack of motion artifact. Paired t-tests and linear regression analysis were performed to compare SD-OCT vs. SS-OCT and evaluate the association between perUSABLE and potential baseline predictor variables (AL, age, gender, lens status, glaucoma diagnosis, myopic macular degeneration presence, peripapillary atrophy presence, disc tilt presence and presence of intrachoroidal cavitations). Results : On average, ONH RNFL scans resulted in significantly greater likelihood of useable scans in Triton (41.8%p) vs. Cirrus scans (15.0%p, p<0.001, paired t-test). Specifically, it was the SS metric that drove this difference. Insufficient SS was found in 1.3%p of Triton scans, but 83.9%p of Cirrus scans (p<0.001). After accounting for potential confounders in multivariate analysis in Cirrus scans, every 1 mm of longer AL was associated with a 1.7%p greater likelihood of insufficient SS (p=0.005), and presence of MMD with +11.8%p (p=0.001). In contrast, in Triton scans, only logMAR VA (worse vision) increased the likelihood of insufficient SS (+1.3%p/ 1.0 LogMAR, p=0.019). Conclusions : SS-OCT appears to be more successful than SD-OCT in providing useable ONH RNFL scans, mainly based on SS differences. In particular, Cirrus SS was affected by longer AL and presence of MMD. Our findings suggest SS-OCT may be more likely to avoid the need for repeated scans to achieve useable ONH RNFL data in HM eyes with MMD.

N2  - Purpose : Current myopia quality-of-life (QoL) questionnaires are burdensome to administer, have complicated scoring systems, and primarily assess vision functioning deficits. To address these issues, we are developing a myopia-specific QoL item bank (IB) that will be operationalized using a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) system to optimize administration and scoring. We report on the content generation and item refinement phases of this myopia specific IB; and compare its content with published literature. Methods : Myopia-specific QoL domains and items were generated from: (1) existing visual and refractive-error specific questionnaires; (2) published articles; and (3) semistructured interviews with patients with myopia (n=39); and healthcare practitioners (clinicians, optometrists, psychologists, and researchers; n=9) recruited from the Singapore National Eye Centre between 2020 and 2021. Following thematic analysis, items were systematically refined and subsequently tested using cognitive interviews with 24 additional patients across the myopia severity spectrum. Results : Of the 39 participants with myopia (mean +/- standard deviation age: 41.4+/-16.3 years; 76.9% female), 16 (41.0%) were spectacle wearers, 10 (25.6%) wore contact lenses regularly, 18 (46.1%) had undergone myopic refractive surgery, and 1 (2.5%) was on atropine drops. Ten (25.6%) patients had clinically-diagnosed pathologic myopia (PM). Whilst some myopia-specific QoL issues identified have been reported previously, e.g., activity limitation and mobility, others like work anxiety, refractive surgery and PM-related issues were novel. Initially, 912 items within seven independent QoL domains were identified: Activity limitation, Concerns, Emotional, Mobility, Management Comfort, Management Convenience, Management Concern, and Work. Following refinement, 249 items were retained, of which 69 (27.7%) were novel. During cognitive interviews, 14 items underwent amendment to improve clarity. Conclusions : Our myopia specific IB comprises 7 QoL domains and 249 items, of which over a quarter are new. It will likely provide a comprehensive assessment of the broad impact of myopia and associated long-term complications, and the patient-centred effectiveness of myopia treatment. The IB will now undergo rigorous psychometric testing to generate item calibrations for the validation of a novel myopia CAT.

N2  - Purpose We have been performing posterior scleral reinforcement in our ophthalmological department since 1992 on progressive highly myopic eyes. Here, we report on our results with this technique in the foregoing 7 years in a retrospective comparative design. Methods Thirty-eight eyes of 32 patients, operated according to Snyder-Thompson's method, were enrolled in this study, and a control group of 9 age- and myopia-matched children's 14 eyes was built for comparison. Pre- and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity, subjective refractive error (spherical equivalent of spectacle dioptres), and axial length were recorded. Changes within groups were calculated, as well as baseline parameters and their changes during follow-up, and compared between the groups. Correlation analysis was performed to identify factors that could influence myopia progression. Results Myopic progression was significantly lower in the operated than in the nonoperated group, both in terms of mean annual axial length as well as refractive error changes (0.21 +/- 0.08 mm versus 0.49 +/- 0.19 mm and 0.18 +/- 0.29 D versus 0.6 +/- 0.33 D, respectively). Mean overall visual improvement was more explicit in operated eyes as compared to those left untreated (0.15 +/- 0.09 versus 0.01 +/- 0.1). No association of any factor with myopia progression could be identified. We encountered no serious or lasting complications. Conclusion In our clinical practice, posterior scleral reinforcement according to Snyder-Thompson proved to be a safely applicable and effective surgical method to stop or significantly retard pathological increases in axial length and dioptres, and thus can help prevent the onset of myopic degenerative lesions, and irreversible visual impairment in the long run.Copyright © 2022 by the Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: To describe a case of hypotony maculopathy following anti-VEGF intravitreal injection (IVI) in a patient with pseudox-anthoma elasticum (PE). Method(s): Clinical case report. Result(s): A 52-year-old male complained of right eye (OD) vision loss 2 days after an uncomplicated anti-VEGF IVI for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to angioid streaks. Relevant medical history included PE, pathologic myopia, and a previous pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) due to a retinal detachment. OD best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) dropped from 6/ 12 to 6/18 after the IVI. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 3 mmHg and chorioretinal folds were evident in the posterior pole. Topical dexamethasone and atropine were prescribed, and full recovery was noticed after 3 days. Four months later, the patient developed a new episode of vision loss after another IVI. His BCVA was counting fingers, IOP was 2mmHg, and more noticeable chorioretinal folds were found. This time, an open scleral wound at the injection site was evident and a scleral suture was necessary. Once again, the patient recovered well. Conclusion(s): Hypotony maculopathy following intravitreal injection is a rare condition. However, the described patient presented several conditions which could be related with poor scleral wound closure: intrinsic scleral fragility due to myopia and pseudox-anthoma elasticum; repeated IVI procedures; and absence of vitreous in the posterior segment due to prior vitrectomy. Despite the good outcome, hypotony maculopathy may be a sight-threatening condition, and special attention is necessary for specific patients with risk factors.Copyright © 2022 Lima-Fontes et al.

N2  - Purpose: To propose an algorithm of the major and minor diagnostic criteria for macular myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Method(s): This single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study was based in Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy. Two authors evaluated the clinical and imaging parameters of eyes with high myopia (spherical equivalent of -6D or less) and suspected to have naive, recurrent, or inactive mCNV. Recordings of the eyes that met the inclusion criteria were then independently evaluated by two other senior retinal specialists. Fluorescein angiography (FA), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and OCT angiography were used for multimodal imaging. Result(s): One-hundred and twenty-two eyes (n = 107; 39 men, 68 women) were included in the study. The mean patient age was 66 years (range, 22-89 years). There were 83 and 39 eyes in the active mCNV and control groups, respectively. The best diagnostic algorithm had positive- and negative-predictive values of 89% and 85%, respectively, and was based on four criteria: leakage/staining on FA, retinal thickening, fuzzy area on SD-OCT, and recent metamorphopsia. When excluding FA-derived findings, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) features played a diagnostic role in 33 eyes (27%). Twenty-seven eyes with active mCNV (32%) did not have the fuzzy area. Taken singularly, no clinical or imaging parameter had both sensitivity and specificity greater than 78%. Matching of 2 or 3 biomarkers did not yield a sensitivity or specificity greater than 79%. Sensitivities and specificities >= 90% were found in ten criteria combinations that included four to five biomarkers. The most frequent were metamorphopsia, fuzzy area, retinal thickening, and leakage. Less frequently, they included hemorrhage, staining, and RPE features such as elevation, flattening, and focal interruption. For all the parameters, the agreement between the investigators was good (Cohen k >= 0.66), being the lowest when detecting the ELM interruption within the lesion. Conclusion(s): A combination of at least four clinical and biological markers yielded the highest positive- and negative-predictive values. More ("major") and less ("minor") frequent diagnostic criteria are proposed.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the predictive factors for postoperative visual acuity improvement (PVAI) in subjects who underwent phakic intraocular lens implantation with a central hole (ICL-V4c) for ultrahigh myopia above - 10 D. Method(s): This was a retrospective study. Eyes with ultrahigh myopia above - 10 D undergoing ICL-V4c implantation were studied. Univariable linear regression models were used to assess the association between PVAI and preoperative parameters. Myopic maculopathy was classified into 5 categories by fundus photography. After the 1-month follow-up, the PVAI was compared within different age and preoperative spherical degree groups. Result(s): This study included 726 eyes from 419 patients (111 men and 308 women), and the mean age, spherical refraction, and axial length were 28.67 +/- 7.93 years, - 13.61 +/- 3.44 D, and 28.59 +/- 1.50 mm, respectively. At baseline, myopic maculopathy was classified (grades C0-C4) as follows: C0 was observed in 200 eyes (27.5%), C1 in 297 eyes (40.9%), C2 in 147 eyes (20.2%), C3 in 22 eyes (3.0%), and C4 in 60 eyes (8.3%). The PVAI was significantly negatively associated with age and positively associated with SD-pre(-Sph), but no significant association between myopic maculopathy classification and axial length was found. After 1 month, 417 eyes (57.4%) gained more than 1 line at BCVA, 250 eyes (34.4%) remained the same, and 59 eyes (8.13%) lost 1 line. The postoperative visual acuity of 52 eyes was improved by more than 3 lines, and 42.3% were grade C4. Conclusion(s): The ICL performed well for the correction of ultrahigh myopia above - 10 D. Younger patients and those with a higher preoperative spherical degree had greater postoperative satisfaction. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000036335).

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate anatomical and visual results of eyes with naive myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in patients treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies. Material(s) and Method(s): This is a retrospective, non-randomized, comperative, intervetional study. One hundred fourteen eyes of 114 patients with mCNV who underwent intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB), intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) or intravitreal aflibercept (IVA) monotherapy injections were enrolled into the study. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT) and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) were compared among the groups during the follow-up periods at the beginning, months 1, 3, 6, 12, and the final visit. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 47.76 +/- 10.57 years (range, 33-72 years) and the mean follow-up period was 23.34 +/- 6.81 months (range, 13-38 months). The mean BCVA denoted a significantly improve at each group (p < 0.05). In terms of an inter-group analysis of all 3 groups, at months 1, 6, and 12 and final visit, the BCVA were statistically significantly better in the IVA group when compared to both IVB and IVR groups (p = 0.021, p = 0.032, p = 0.024, p = 0.012). There was a significant decrease in CMT following IVB (236.49 +/- 40.91 mum-190.74 +/- 50.12 mum), IVA (232.91 +/- 46.29 mum-193.73 +/- 46.81 mum) and IVR (234.78 +/- 45.37 mum-192.21 +/- 37.27 mum) between baseline and final visit (p = 0.018, p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively). There was a statistically significant decrease in SFCT values between baseline and final examination only in the IVA group (p < 0.001). The mean number of injections were 9.18 +/- 3.18 (range; 3 to 13) in IVB, 6.46 +/- 2.93 (range; 3-11) in IVR and 4.45 +/- 1.42 (range; 2-7) in IVA (p = 0.028). Conclusion(s): All three anti-VEGFs were found to be effective in terms of visual results in patients with mCNV. However, we demonstrated that IVA reduces the need for anti-VEGF when compared to patients who received both IVB and IVR. Furthermore, IVA induced a prominent reduction in SFCT, whereas IVR and IVB did not have a significant action on SFCT.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - PURPOSE. To determine the shape of posterior staphylomas using ultra-widefield optical coherence tomographic (UWF-OCT) images and to identify the factors contributing to the shape and grade of the staphylomas in eyes with pathologic myopia. METHODS. This was an observational case series study. Highly myopic patients who were >=40 years old with wide or narrow type of macular staphylomas were studied. High myopia was defined as a myopic refractive error (spherical equivalent) greater than -8.0 diopters (D) or an axial length (AL) > 26.5 mm. The maximum diameter and depth of the staphylomas were measured in the 12 radial scans of UWF-OCT images by ImageJ software and were compared between the two types of staphylomas. RESULTS. We studied 197 eyes of 138 patients with a mean age of 64.7 +/- 10.4 years and mean AL of 30.0 +/- 1.9 mm. The AL was significantly longer in the eyes with the narrow type than the wide type of staphyloma (P = 0.036). Multiple regression analyses showed that age was significantly correlated with the maximum depth/maximum diameter ratio (wide type, P < 0.001; narrow type, P = 0.003) of both types of staphylomas. The AL was significantly correlated with the depth/diameter ratio of only the narrow type of staphylomas (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS. The significant correlations of age and AL with the wide and narrow types of posterior staphylomas indicate that the factors for their formations may be distinctly different. Quantitative analyses of UWF-OCT images are helpful in determining the shape of the staphylomas.Copyright 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: To grade myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) patients according to the new myopic maculopathy classification (A: atrophy, T: traction, N: neovascularization-ATN) and analyze the correlation in between atrophy, traction and neovascularization. Method(s): Fifty-one eyes of 41 patients with the diagnosis of pathologic myopia and myopic CNV were included in this clinical practice study. Patients were graded according to the recently described ATN classification. Color fundus photographs were used to grade the atrophy and spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans were used to grade traction and neovascularization. Active myopic CNVs were treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. Chi-square test was used to test the categorical variants and univariate logistic regression analysis was used to predict the independent risk factors of myopic CNV scar formation. Result(s): Active myopic CNV was observed most frequently in the group with patchy chorioretinal atrophy. Grade of the atrophy and female gender were significantly associated with myopic CNV scar in the univariate logistic regression tests. Multivariate logistic regression showed that atrophy grading is the independent predictor of myopic CNV scar. Conclusion(s): ATN classification is a practical and comprehensive system to grade myopic CNV. Atrophy is an independent predictor for myopic CNV scar and patchy chorioretinal atrophy requires a more careful examination and close follow-up for the risk of CNV development.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - Myopia represents a major socioeconomic burden with an increasing prevalence worldwide. Pathologic myopia refers to myopic patients with structural changes in the posterior pole including different patterns of chorioretinal atrophy, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and vitreomacular tractional diseases. Multifocal choroiditis (MFC) is one of the most frequent noninfectious posterior uveitis, and epidemiologically typically affects young myopic females. Acute and chronic chorioretinal atrophic changes are the hallmark feature of MFC, with CNV developing in almost one third of cases. Thus, differentiation of inflammatory lesions due to MFC or neurodenegerative lesions due to pathologic myopic is key in order to establish a particular prognosis, follow-up schedule, and therapeutic approach. The aim of the present manuscript is to summarize and illustrate the main multimodal imaging features of these diseases.Copyright © 2022 Gallego-Pinazo, Hernandez and Dolz-Marco.

N2  - Purpose To assess the relationship of demographics, clinical characteristics and structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings to disease recurrence in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed myopic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) Methods In this retrospective, longitudinal study, a total of 64 participants (64 eyes) with successfully treated myopic CNV had obtained resolution of exudation after treatment (study baseline) and with 3 years of regular follow-ups. Several baseline OCT qualitative features and quantitative measurements were assessed at baseline and included in the analysis. Main outcome measures included incidence of disease recurrence and HR for demographics, clinical characteristics and OCT risk factors. Results At month 36, 40 eyes (62.5%) developed disease recurrence (active CNV). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that final visual acuity (dependent variable) was associated with visual acuity at the first visit after complete resolution of exudation (p<0.0001), baseline size of patchy atrophy (p=0.010), baseline subfoveal choroidal thickness (p=0.008), baseline maximum CNV height and width (p=0.011 and p=0.003) and recurrence of CNV exudation (p=0.007). The following factors were associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence: size of patchy atrophy had an HR of 1.14 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.29; p=0.036); maximum CNV width had an HR of 1.02 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.04; p<0.0001). Conclusion We identified OCT risk factors for the disease recurrence in eyes with successfully treated myopic CNV. Assuming that disease recurrence is a sight-threatening event, our findings may help in the identification of high-risk patients and eventually ameliorate their outcome.Copyright ©

N2  - Aim To explore and evaluate an appropriate deep learning system (DLS) for the detection of 12 major fundus diseases using colour fundus photography. Methods Diagnostic performance of a DLS was tested on the detection of normal fundus and 12 major fundus diseases including referable diabetic retinopathy, pathologic myopic retinal degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment, wet and dry age-related macular degeneration, epiretinal membrane, macula hole, possible glaucomatous optic neuropathy, papilledema and optic nerve atrophy. The DLS was developed with 56 738 images and tested with 8176 images from one internal test set and two external test sets. The comparison with human doctors was also conducted. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the DLS on the internal test set and the two external test sets were 0.950 (95% CI 0.942 to 0.957) to 0.996 (95% CI 0.994 to 0.998), 0.931 (95% CI 0.923 to 0.939) to 1.000 (95% CI 0.999 to 1.000) and 0.934 (95% CI 0.929 to 0.938) to 1.000 (95% CI 0.999 to 1.000), with sensitivities of 80.4% (95% CI 79.1% to 81.6%) to 97.3% (95% CI 96.7% to 97.8%), 64.6% (95% CI 63.0% to 66.1%) to 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%) and 68.0% (95% CI 67.1% to 68.9%) to 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%), respectively, and specificities of 89.7% (95% CI 88.8% to 90.7%) to 98.1% (95%CI 97.7% to 98.6%), 78.7% (95% CI 77.4% to 80.0%) to 99.6% (95% CI 99.4% to 99.8%) and 88.1% (95% CI 87.4% to 88.7%) to 98.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.0%), respectively. When compared with human doctors, the DLS obtained a higher diagnostic sensitivity but lower specificity. Conclusion The proposed DLS is effective in diagnosing normal fundus and 12 major fundus diseases, and thus has much potential for fundus diseases screening in the real world.Copyright © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group.

N2  - Purpose: Myopia is the most common type of refractive error and the leading cause of functional visual loss. Increased risk of myopic maculopathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma and cataract has been seen with a myopia of as low as -1D. This study was done to determine the effect of atropine 0.01% eye drops on the progression of myopia in children >5 years. Method(s): This was a single-blind, prospective, randomized case-control study which included children of 5-15 years with myopia of >2D and were divided into treatment group (group 1) and placebo group (group 2). Children under treatment group were treated with application of 0.01% atropine at night. Children with history of any ocular surgery, chronic ophthalmic illness, squint and amblyopia were excluded from the study. The follow-up for myopia progression was done for two years. Result(s): This study showed a significant difference in increase of spherical equivalent and axial length among treatment and placebo groups after a duration of two years. Total duration of follow up was twenty-four months. Mean increase in axial length of group 1 and 2 was 0.115 mm and 0.32 mm, respectively. Mean increase in refraction of groups 1 and 2 was -0.30 D and -0.88 D, respectively, showing significant change in axial length and refraction (P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): This study supports the use of atropine 0.01% eye drops in reducing the progression of myopia.

N2  - Background: RPGR mutations are the most common cause of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP). High myopia has been described as a very frequent feature among affected female carriers of XLRP. However, the clinical phenotype of female patients presenting with X-linked RPGR-related high myopia has not been well described. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective case series of four female patients with RPGR mutations and a diagnosis of high myopia, who presented to two academic eye centers. Clinical data, including age, family history, visual acuity, refractive error, dilated fundus exam, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, electroretinography, and results of genetic testing, were collected. Result(s): Three RPGR variants identified in the present study have not been previously associated with myopia in female carriers. One variant (c.2405_2406delAG, p.Glu802Glyfs *32) has been previously associated with a myopic phenotype in a female patient. Patients became symptomatic between the first and sixth decades of life. Myopia-associated tilted optic discs and posterior staphyloma were present in all patients. Two patients presented with intraretinal migration of the retinal pigment epithelium. Conclusion(s): RPGR-related high myopia has been associated with mutations in exons 1-14 and ORF15 in heterozygous females. There is a wide range of visual function among carriers. Although the exact mechanism of RPGR-related high myopia is still unclear, continued molecular diagnosis and description of phenotypes remain a crucial step in understanding the impact of RPGR mutations on visual function in female XLRP carriers.Copyright © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - A severe form of myopia defined as pathologic/high myopia is the main cause of visual impairment and one of the most frequent causes of blindness worldwide. It is characterized by at least 6 diopters or axial length (AL) of eyeball > 26 mm and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in 5 to 10% of cases. Ranibizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody fragment targeted against human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) used in the treatment of CNV. It acts by preventing VEGF-A from interacting with its receptors (VEGFR-1 and-2) encoded by the FLT1 and KDR genes. Several studies found that the KDR and FLT1 genotypes may represent predictive determinants of efficacy in ranibizumab-treated neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) patients. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in VEGFR coding genes with the response rate to ranibizumab in patients with high myopia and CNV. In the association study of genotypes in FLT1 with the response to ranibizumab, we found a significant association between two FLT1 variants (rs9582036, rs7993418) with ranibizumab efficacy at the 12-month follow-up. About the KDR gene, we found that two KDR variants (rs2305948, rs2071559) are associated with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement and KDR (rs2239702) is associated with lower rates of BCVA worsening considering a 12-month follow-up period.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the clinical characteristics, internal correlations and risk factors for different locations of retinoschisis (RS) in an elderly high myopia (HM) population. Method(s): A total of 448 eyes (304 participants) were analysed and classified into no retinoschisis (no-RS), paravascular retinoschisis (PVRS), peripapillary retinoschisis (PPRS) and macular retinoschisis (MRS) groups. Each participant underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, and posterior scleral height (PSH) was measured in swept-source optical coherence tomography images. PSH, vitreoretinal interface abnormities and myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM) were compared among groups. Result(s): Retinoschisis was found in 195 (43.5%) eyes, among which 170 (37.9%) had PVRS, 123 (27.5%) had PPRS, and 103 (23.0%) had MRS. MRS was found to be combined with PVRS in 96 of 103 (93.2%) eyes. MAM was one of the risk factors for RS (odds ratio [OR], 2.459; p = 0.005). Higher nasal PSH was the only risk factor for PVRS (OR, 9.103; p = 0.008 per 1-mm increase). Elongation of axial length (AL) (OR, 1.891; p < 0.001 per 1-mm increase), higher PSH in nasal (OR, 5.059; p = 0.009 per 1-mm increase) and temporal (OR, 13.021; p = 0.012 per 1-mm increase), epiretinal membrane (ERM; OR, 2.841; p = 0.008) and vitreomacular traction (VMT; OR, 7.335; p = 0.002) were risk factors for MRS. Conclusion(s): Paravascular retinoschisis is the most common type of RS in HM and MRS is mostly combined with PVRS. MAM is one of the risk factors for RS. In addition to longer AL and higher PSH, the presence of VMT and ERM also play an important role in the formation of MRS.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose:To identify baseline morphological predictors of lesion shrinkage in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. Method(s):This retrospective study included 46 eyes (41 consecutive patients) with active mCNV receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. Optical coherence tomography angiography was performed at baseline and 1 year after treatment. Quantitative features were obtained from optical coherence tomography angiography images using AngioTool software. Eyes were classified as "high shrinkage" or "low shrinkage" according to the median relative change in lesion area. Baseline quantitative morphological features associated with mCNV shrinkage were identified in univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s):The mCNV area was significantly smaller after 1 year (P = 0.013), with a median relative change of -16.5%. The relative change in mCNV area was -48.3% in high-shrinkage eyes (n = 23) and -5.2% in low-shrinkage eyes (n = 23). High-shrinkage eyes had a smaller mCNV area (P = 0.013), shorter total vessel length (P = 0.023), and higher end point density (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed significant associations of high shrinkage with end point density (beta = -0.037, P = 0.043) and previous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment (beta = 0.216, P = 0.029). Conclusion(s):Morphological features of neovascularization detected by optical coherence tomography angiography can predict lesion shrinkage in eyes with mCNV receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. Higher end point density contributed to shrinkage, particularly of treatment-naive lesions.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

N2  - A 55-year-old male was referred to the Neuro-ophthalmology clinic due to gradual onset, progressive vision loss. On fundus examination a subtle yellow-orange peripapillary lesion was detected in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography with radial scanning illustrated retinal nerve fibre layer thinning as well as an area of intrachoroidal cavitation that corresponded to the lesion. Visual field testing showed a left inferior arcuate defect. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit, and laboratory testing was unremarkable. Clinical examination, imaging, and testing were consistent with peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation (PICC). Follow-up with serial visual field testing showed mild progression of the field defect. While PICC is not well understood in the literature, studies have reported associated risk factors including pathological myopia, older age, increased ocular axial length, chorioretinal atrophy, and vascular abnormalities. Importantly, glaucoma-like visual field defects as well as structural changes have been noticed in a high proportion of patients with PICC. While these alterations are evident, the pathogenic relationship between them is yet to be uncovered. Treatment with anti-glaucoma medications has been suggested, however, the evidence remains scarce for its true benefits. Care providers must be aware of the presentation of a yellow-orange peripapillary lesion with an associated visual field defect to accurately diagnose and manage this condition.Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Purpose: To report clinical outcomes of a pediatric patient with unilateral reversible vision loss secondary to hypotony from repeated accidental nocturnal ocular compression from circumaural headphone wear. Observations: A 17-year-old male with pathologic myopia and history of retinopathy of prematurity previously treated with laser ablation in both eyes presented with reduced visual acuity in his right eye from choroidal detachment and hypotony maculopathy. In the absence of uveitis and intraocular pressure lowering medications, it was determined that repeated nocturnal ocular compression from circumaural headphones created episodes of hypotony. With avoidance of this behavior and in the absence of pathologic aqueous dynamics, intraocular pressure normalized with gradual resolution of choroidal thickening and restoration to baseline visual acuity. Conclusions and Importance: Persistent and prolonged ocular compression, even unintentionally, can create hypotony with risk for vision loss, maculopathy, and choroidal detachment.Copyright © 2022 The Authors

N2  - Purpose: To identify the risk factors associated with myopic macular neovascularization (mMNV)-related complications in patients treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents. Design(s): Longitudinal cohort study. Participant(s): Myopic eyes (n = 313) with active mMNV and median (interquartile range) follow-up of 42 months (interquartile range, 18-68 months) after initiation of anti-VEGF treatment. Method(s): Data regarding patients' clinical and mMNV-related characteristics were collected at baseline. Subsequent OCT scans were inspected for mMNV-related complications. Best-measured visual acuity (BMVA) values were retrieved from each visit. Main Outcome Measure(s): Incidence rate and hazard ratio (HR, with 95% confidence interval [CI]) of risk factors for fibrosis and macular atrophy calculated with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. Crude incidence of macular hole (MH). Longitudinal BMVA changes. Result(s): Five-year incidence of fibrosis, atrophy, and MH were 34%, 26%, and 8%, respectively. The rate of fibrosis was 10.3 (95% CI, 8.25-12.6) per 100 person-years. Risk factors were subfoveal mMNV location (HR [95% CI] = 12.7 [2.70-56.7] vs. extrafoveal, P = 0.001) and intraretinal fluid at baseline (HR [95% CI] = 1.75 [1.05-2.98], P = 0.03). The rate of macular atrophy was 6.5 (95% CI, 5-8.3) per 100 person-years. Risk factors were diffuse (HR, 2.20 vs. tessellated fundus; 95% CI, 1.13-5.45; P = 0.02) or patchy chorioretinal atrophy (HR, 3.17 vs. tessellated fundus; 95% CI, 1.32-7.64; P = 0.01) at baseline and more numerous anti-VEGF injections before baseline (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.38 for each treatment; P = 0.005). Eyes with fibrosis and macular atrophy had faster BMVA decay over follow-up. Twenty eyes (6%) developed MH. Two subtypes of MH were identified: "atrophic" and "tractional." Conclusion(s): Myopic MNV-related complications are common in the long term despite initially successful treatment and have detrimental effects on visual acuity. Insights into their incidence and risk factors may help for future treatments to mitigate sight-threatening outcomes.Copyright © 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of paravascular abnormalities (PVAs) and retinoschisis, and their associations with choroidal thickness (ChT) in young highly myopic (HM) adults. Method(s): A total number of 645 eyes were included. Paravascular microfolds (PMs), paravascular cystoid spaces (PCs), paravascular lamellar holes (PLHs), and retinoschisis were detected using swept-source optical coherence tomography. Their associations with macular ChT and risk factors were analyzed. Result(s): PMs, PCs, and PLHs were detected in 203 (31.5%), 141 (21.9%), and 30 (4.7%) eyes, respectively. Retinoschisis was found in 50 (7.8%) eyes, 43 (86.0%) of which were located around the retinal vessels surrounding the optic disc. A decreasing trend of macular ChT (P < 0.001) was observed in the eyes with PMs only, with both PCs and PMs, and with PLHs, PCs, and PMs. After adjustments for age, sex, and axial length (AL), the presence of PCs, PLHs, or retinoschisis around the optic disc was negatively associated with macular ChT (all P < 0.05). Eyes with longer AL, incomplete posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), and myopic atrophic maculopathy (MAM) were more likely to have PCs (all P < 0.01) and retinoschisis around the optic disc (all P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): PVAs were observed in approximately one third of the young HM adults in this study. The presence of PCs, PLHs, or retinoschisis around the optic disc was associated with thinner macular ChT. Eyes with longer AL, incomplete PVD, and MAM may be at risk of developing PVAs and retinoschisis around the optic disc. Translational Relevance: PCs, PLHs, and retinoschisis around the optic disc could serve as early indicators for myopia progression.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Pathological myopia (PM) and its associated complications can lead to permanent vision loss. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying PM development remain unclear. To identify the metabolic alterations that may contribute to the pathophysiology of PM, we performed non-targeted metabolomics analysis using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry in age- and sex-matched patients with PM (n = 30) and individuals without myopia as controls (n = 30). Targeted metabolomics and insulin microarray were used to validate the results. We identified 508 metabolites in the aqueous humour (AH) and 601 in the vitreous humour (VH). Statistical evaluation revealed that 104 metabolites in AH and 114 metabolites in VH were significantly different between the two groups (variable important for the projection >1, fold change >1.5, or < 0.667, and P < 0.05). The four metabolic pathways enriched in both AH and VH identified to be associated with PM were: bile secretion, insulin secretion, thyroid hormone synthesis, and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The concentration of 10 amino acids was significantly higher in the PM than in the controls. Insulin microarray analysis showed that insulin, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), IGF-2R, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-6 levels were significantly higher in PM patients compared to that in the controls. Thus, this study identified potential metabolite biomarkers for PM and provided novel insights into the mechanisms underlying this disorder.Copyright © 2022

N2  - Purpose: To develop deep learning models based on color fundus photographs that can automatically grade myopic maculopathy, diagnose pathologic myopia, and identify and segment myopia-related lesions. Method(s): Photographs were graded and annotated by four ophthalmologists and were then divided into a high-consistency subgroup or a low-consistency subgroup according to the consistency between the results of the graders. ResNet-50 network was used to develop the classification model, and DeepLabv3+ network was used to develop the segmentation model for lesion identification. The two models were then combined to develop the classification-and-segmentation-based co-decision model. Result(s): This study included 1395 color fundus photographs from 895 patients. The grading accuracy of the co-decision model was 0.9370, and the quadraticweighted kappa coefficient was 0.9651; the co-decision model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9980 in diagnosing pathologic myopia. The photograph-level F1 values of the segmentation model identifying optic disc, peripapillary atrophy, diffuse atrophy, patchy atrophy, and macular atrophy were all >0.95; the pixel-level F1 values for segmenting optic disc and peripapillary atrophy were both >0.9; the pixel-level F1 values for segmenting diffuse atrophy, patchy atrophy, and macular atrophy were all >0.8; and the photograph-level recall/sensitivity for detecting lacquer cracks was 0.9230. Conclusion(s): The models could accurately and automatically grade myopic maculopathy, diagnose pathologic myopia, and identify and monitor progression of the lesions. Translational Relevance: The models can potentially help with the diagnosis, screening, and follow-up for pathologic myopic in clinical practice.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the transancestry portability of current myopia polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to predict high myopia (HM) and myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in an Asian population. Design(s): Population-based study. Participant(s): A total of 5894 adults (2141 Chinese, 1913 Indian, and 1840 Malay) from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study were included in the analysis. The mean +/- standard deviation age was 57.05 +/- 9.31 years. A total of 361 adults had a diagnosis of HM (spherical equivalent [SE] < -5.00 diopters [D]) from refraction measurements, 240 individuals had a diagnosis of MMD graded by the International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy criteria from fundus photographs, and 3774 individuals were control participants without myopia (SE > -0.5 D). Method(s): The PRS, derived from 687 289 HapMap3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the largest genome-wide association study of myopia in Europeans to date (n = 260 974), was assessed on its ability to predict patients with HM and MMD versus control participants. Main Outcome Measure(s): The primary outcomes were the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to predict HM and MMD. Result(s): The PRS had an AUC of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.75) for HM and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.63-0.70) for MMD versus no myopia. The inclusion of the PRS with other predictors (age, sex, educational attainment [EA], and ancestry; age-by-ancestry, sex-by-ancestry, and EA-by-ancestry interactions; and 20 genotypic principal components) increased the AUC to 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86) for HM and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.82) for MMD. Individuals with a PRS in the top 5% showed up to a 4.66 (95% CI, 3.34-6.42) times higher risk of HM developing and up to a 3.43 (95% CI, 2.27-5.05) times higher risk of MMD developing compared with the remaining 95% of individuals. Conclusion(s): The PRS is a good predictor for HM and facilitates the identification of high-risk children to prevent myopia progression to HM. In addition, the PRS also predicts MMD and helps to identify high-risk adults with myopia who require closer monitoring for myopia-related complications.Copyright © 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: To investigate long-term treatment effect on myopic macular neovascularization (MNV) in a large European cohort, in terms of visual outcome, recurrence rate and the chance of second eye involvement. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 98 eyes of 87 consecutive patients from European descent with myopic MNV were studied. The number of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, the number of recurrences, the chance of second eye involvement and final visual outcome were registered. Patients were followed from first anti-VEGF injection up to 12 years. Result(s): Mean age of myopic MNV onset was 57 years, and mean SE was-14D. Myopic macular neovascularization was effectively treated with anti-VEGF (median of 2 injections). Treatment initially improved BCVA (p < 0.001), but after 48 months BCVA was no longer significantly better than before treatment (p = 0.5). More than 50% of cases experienced a recurrence within a 10-year follow-up. Twenty-two (25%) fellow eyes developed MNV after an average of 5.7 years. Age >= 40 years at MNV significantly increased the risk for bilateral MNV (HR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-13.9, p = 0.008). Chorioretinal atrophy and lacquer cracks in the fellow eye at baseline were not significant predictors. Conclusion(s): Myopic macular neovascularization is a vision threatening complication that can effectively be treated with anti-VEGF. However, after 4 years, the vision is no longer significantly improved. Patients should be monitored since recurrences occur and especially young patients are at risk of second eye involvement.

N2  - Objectives To evaluate incidence, predictors, and re-treatment outcome of recurrent myopic choroidal neovascularization (m-CNV). Methods Retrospective consecutive observational series. From year 2014 to 2019, 167 eyes of 167 patients of treatment naive m-CNV were enrolled. 59 and 108 eyes were treated with intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab mono-therapy, respectively. Recurrence was defined as re-appearance of CNV activity, confirmed on optical coherence tomography (OCT) after at least 3 months of cessation of anti-VEGF therapy. Incidence of recurrence, predictors and re-treatment outcomes were studied. Results Overall, mean age and spherical equivalence (SE) was 47.95 +/- 14.72 years and -12.19 +/- 4.93 D respectively. Males constituted 50.9%. 44 eyes (26.4%) had a recurrence during a mean follow up of 16.5 +/- 12.86 months. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the risk of recurrence was 8, 26 and, 33.6% at 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively. Age (p = 0.511), gender (p = 0.218), SE (p = 0.092), anti-VEGF (p = 0.629) and baseline BCVA (p = 0.519) did not influence recurrence. Number of injections administered to control the disease in the first episode was the only significant predictor of recurrence (Cox Proportional Hazard Ratio 2.89-3.07, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.28-7.45; p = 0.005). At 12 months, eyes requiring one injection in first episode had a recurrence rate of 12% versus 45% in eyes requiring 3 or more injections in the first episode. A mean number of 1.9 additional injections per eye was needed during re-treatment. Final BCVA in the recurrence group was similar to that of non-recurrence group (0.53 +/- 0.40 versus 0.55 +/- 0.36 LogMAR; p = 0.755). Baseline BCVA (p = 0.0001) was the only predictor of final visual outcome irrespective of anti-VEGF drug (p = 0.38). Conclusion Eyes requiring greater number of injections for disease control in first episode are "at risk" of early m-CNV recurrence. However, recurrence does not adversely affect visual outcome, if treated adequately.Copyright © 2022 Jain et al.

N2  - Purpose: To report ocular characteristics and early visual outcomes of highly myopic cataract eyes, and to analyze the risk factors of low vision. Method(s): A total of 2,027 eyes of 1,400 cataract patients with axial length (AL) >= 26 mm undergoing cataract surgery in Eye & ENT Hospital of Fudan University, who were registered in the Shanghai High Myopia Study, were analyzed. Routine pre-operative ophthalmic examinations were performed and macular scan of optical coherence tomography (OCT) were obtained. Macular complications, central foveal thickness (CFT) and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) were evaluated from OCT images. Ocular and surgical history and perioperative complications were also recorded. Uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity (UCVA/BCVA) 1 month post-operatively and its influencing factors were evaluated. Result(s): The average AL of all involved eyes was 29.52 +/- 2.26 mm, and 39.7% of which were with an AL > 30 mm and 26.4% of which were with a corneal astigmatism more than 1.5 D. Nuclear cataract accounted for the largest proportion (70.6%). The rate of overall macular complications was 27.6%. Postoperative UCVA and BCVA were 0.70 +/- 0.46 and 0.25 +/- 0.32 logMAR, respectively. BCVA improved significantly after surgery (vs. P < 0.001) and affected by the elongation of AL (P < 0.001) and thinning of CFT and SFCT (both P < 0.001). The risk factors of post-operative low vision (BCVA < 20/66) were macular atrophy, lamellar macular hole, high corneal astigmatism, long AL, thin SFCT and junior surgeons, odds ratios ranging from 1.54 to 54.87 (all P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Cataract surgery could improve the VA of highly myopic eyes. Eye with macular complications, higher corneal astigmatism, longer AL, thinner SFCT, and who was treated by a junior surgeon, may have a high risk of low vision after surgery.Copyright © 2022 He, Yao, Zhang, Du, Qi, Zhang, Zhang, Zhao, Cai, Fan, Jiang, Yang, Zhu and Lu.

N2  - Purpose: To characterize the choroidal morphologic and vascular features in different levels of myopes and patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Method(s): A total of 148 subjects were enrolled in this cross-sectional study, including 78 low-to-moderate myopes (LMM), 53 high myopes (HM), and 17 high myopic patients with mCNV. Ocular biometrics were measured using an optical low-coherence reflectometry device. Retinal and choroidal imaging was performed using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Retinal parameters including retinal thickness and retinal volume were obtained from a built-in software. Binarization technique was adopted to investigate choroidal parameters including choroidal thickness (CT), vascular area, stromal area, and choroidal vascularity index (CVI). Choroidal parameters were measured at five locations to cover as much area of choroid as possible, and their patterns of distribution were further analyzed. Result(s): Patients with mCNV had an atrophic retina of comparable thickness to HM (273.65 +/- 17.28 vs. 276.49 +/- 13.29 mum, p = 0.47), but the choroid was thinner than that of HM (153.94 +/- 15.12 vs. 236.09 +/- 38.51 mum, p < 0.001). Subfoveal CVI was greatest in the mCNV eyes (0.651 +/- 0.009), followed by HM (0.645 +/- 0.012) and LMM eyes (0.636 +/- 0.012). Similar to CT, CVI was also found significantly different among these three groups at all five locations (p for trend < 0.001 for all locations). Axial length (AL) was negatively correlated with retinal volume (r = -0.236, p = 0.009), which is the only significant finding in associations between ocular factors and retinal parameters. Strong, negative correlations were identified between AL and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT, r = -0.820, p < 0.001). However, AL was positively correlated with subfoveal CVI (r = 0.668, p < 0.001). CVI was greater in myopic eyes with thinner choroid (r = -0.578, p < 0.001). BCVA exhibited no significant association with CVI (r = 0.139, p = 0.092), but was negatively correlated with SFCT (r = -0.386, p < 0.001) and positively correlated with AL (r = 0.351, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Choroid in patients with mCNV was thinner yet more vascularized than that in HM and LMM subjects. CVI increased with a longer AL which was associated with a smaller SFCT, choroidal vascular area (VA), and total choroidal area (TCA). Better BCVA was achieved in subjects with thicker SFCT and shorter AL.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Yang, Liu, Yang, Xia, Ren, Hou, Ge, Wang and Li.

N2  - Purpose: To describe the longitudinal structural changes of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to detect biomarkers in the evolution of MTM. Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted on patients with MTM as defined by OCT. A minimum follow-up of 6 months was necessary for study inclusion. The effects of comprehensive OCT-based structure on the evolution of MTM, the progression rates, and resolution rates of MTM were evaluated. Result(s): A total of 120 eyes (120 patients) were included with an average follow-up of 15.4 months. During the follow-up, MTM progressed in 32 eyes (26.67%). The most common pattern of progression observed was the increased extent of retinoschisis in 12 eyes. The multivariate analysis showed that the presence of MTM progression had a significant correlation with internal limiting membrane (ILM) detachment and retinoschisis involved the entire macula at baseline. Five eyes (4.17%) experienced MTM resolution, of which 2 eyes developed disruptions of detached ILM, two eyes developed disruptions of epiretinal membrane, and one eye developed partial posterior vitreous detachment. Eyes with foveal detachment showed the highest progression rate (41.67%) and highest resolution rate (16.67%) compared to the eyes with other foveal complications. Conclusion(s): ILM detachment is a risk factor for MTM progression and MTM resolution can occur after ILM disruption. These suggest that ILM may play an important role as a biomarker in the evolution of MTM.Copyright © 2022 Fang, Su, Chen and Zhang.

N2  - Discovering a relationship between axial length and vitreous volume would be helpful since the axial length is easier to measure than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters. This study aimed to analyze the topography of human eyes with pathological myopia through volume rendering images by high-resolution 3D-MRI and to establish a model to estimate the vitreous volume.This was a retrospective, non-randomized, controlled study of patients evaluated at Tongren Hospital from July 7, 2007 to December 12, 2018. The controls were emmetropic volunteers. All participants underwent ophthalmic examinations. Axial length was measured with an IOL Master. High-resolution 3D MRI and volume rendering was utilized for all the eyes. Logistic regression was used to establish a model to predict the vitreous volume.A total of 280 emmetropic eyes and 290 eyes with pathological myopia were included. Males represented 60.7% and 65.5% of the individuals. The mean axial lengths of those two groups were 23.1 +/- 0.8 mm (95%CI: 22.7-23.4 mm) and 28.3 +/- 2.2 mm (95%CI: 27.5-29.2 mm), respectively (P < .001). The regression model in the pathological myopic group for calculating the vitreous volume according to the axial length was: Vitreous volume = 546.27 x axial length - 6977.12. The regression model in the emmetropic group for calculating the vitreous volume according to the axial length was: Vitreous volume = 458.35 x axial length - 6331.14 (R2 = 0.360, P = .001).Elongation of the axial length is involved in eyeball enlargement in pathological myopic eyes. Measurement of the axial length could be recommended for the estimation of the vitreous volume during vitrectomy if vitreous cavity filling is needed.Copyright © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - Background: Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) is a common complication of pathological myopia. Once developed, most eyes with myopic CNV (mCNV) experience a progression to macular atrophy, which leads to irreversible vision loss. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is used to treat diseases characterised by neovascularisation and is increasingly used to treat mCNV. Objective(s): To assess the effects of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), compared with other treatments, sham treatment or no treatment, in people with pathological myopia. Search Method(s): We searched a number of electronic databases including CENTRAL and Ovid MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. Electronic databases were last searched on 16 June 2016. Selection Criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing anti-VEGF therapy with another treatment (e.g. photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin, laser photocoagulation, macular surgery, another anti-VEGF), sham treatment or no treatment in participants with mCNV. Data Collection and Analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional data. We analysed outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs). We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Main Result(s): The present review included six studies which provided data on the comparison between anti-VEGF with PDT, laser, sham treatment and another anti-VEGF treatment, with 594 participants with mCNV. Three trials compared bevacizumab or ranibizumab with PDT, one trial compared bevacizumab with laser, one trial compared aflibercept with sham treatment, and two trials compared bevacizumab with ranibizumab. Pharmaceutical companies conducted two trials. The trials were conducted at multiple clinical centres across three continents (Europe, Asia and North America). In all these six trials, one eye for each participant was included in the study. When compared with PDT, people treated with anti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab (one RCT), bevacizumab (two RCTs)), were more likely to regain vision. At one year of follow-up, the mean visual acuity (VA) in participants treated with anti-VEGFs was -0.14 logMAR better, equivalent of seven Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters, compared with people treated with PDT (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.20 to -0.08, 3 RCTs, 263 people, low-certainty evidence). The RR for proportion of participants gaining 3+ lines of VA was 1.86 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.73, 2 RCTs, 226 people, moderate-certainty evidence). At two years, the mean VA in people treated with anti-VEGFs was -0.26 logMAR better, equivalent of 13 ETDRS letters, compared with people treated with PDT (95% CI -0.38 to -0.14, 2 RCTs, 92 people, low-certainty evidence). The RR for proportion of people gaining 3+ lines of VA at two years was 3.43 (95% CI 1.37 to 8.56, 2 RCTs, 92 people, low-certainty evidence). People treated with anti-VEGFs showed no obvious reduction (improvement) in central retinal thickness at one year compared with people treated with PDT (MD -17.84 mu;m, 95% CI -41.98 to 6.30, 2 RCTs, 226 people, moderate-certainty evidence). There was low-certainty evidence that people treated with anti-VEGF were more likely to have CNV angiographic closure at 1 year (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54, 2 RCTs, 208 people). One study allowed ranibizumab treatment as of month 3 in participants randomised to PDT, which may have led to an underestimate of the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment. When compared with laser photocoagulation, there was more improvement in VA among bevacizumab-treated people than among laser-treated people after one year (MD -0.22 logMAR, equivalent of 11 ETDRS letters, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.01, 1 RCT, 36 people, low-certainty evidence) and after two years (MD -0.29 logMAR, equivalent of 14 ETDRS letters, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.08, 1 RCT, 36 people, low-certainty evidence). When compared with sham treatment, people treated with aflibercept had better vision at one year (MD -0.19 logMAR, equivalent of 9 ETDRS letters, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.12, 1 RCT, 121 people, moderate-certainty evidence). The fact that this study allowed for aflibercept treatment at 6 months in the control group might cause an underestimation of the benefit with anti-VEGF. People treated with ranibizumab had similar improvement in VA recovery compared with people treated with bevacizumab after one year (MD -0.02 logMAR, equivalent of 1 ETDRS letter, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.06, 2 RCTs, 80 people, moderate-certainty evidence). Of the included six studies, two studies reported no adverse events in either group and two industry-sponsored studies reported both systemic and ocular adverse events. In the control group, there were no systemic or ocular adverse events reported in 149 participants. Fifteen people reported systemic serious adverse events among 359 people treated with anti-VEGF agents (15/359, 4.2%). Five people reported ocular adverse events among 359 people treated with anti-VEGF agents (5/359, 1.4%). The number of adverse events was low, and the estimate of RR was uncertain regarding systemic serious adverse events (4 RCTs, 15 events in 508 people, RR 4.50, 95% CI 0.60 to 33.99, very low-certainty evidence) and serious ocular adverse events (4 RCTs, 5 events in 508 people, RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.23 to 14.71, very low-certainty evidence). There were no reports of mortality or cases of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment. There was sparse reporting of data for vision-related quality of life (in favour of anti-VEGF) in only one trial at one year of follow-up. The studies did not report data for other outcomes, such as percentage of participants with newly developed chorioretinal atrophy. Authors' conclusions: There is low to moderate-certainty evidence from RCTs for the efficacy of anti-VEGF agents to treat mCNV at one year and two years. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests ranibizumab and bevacizumab are equivalent in terms of efficacy. Adverse effects occurred rarely and the trials included here were underpowered to assess these. Future research should be focused on the efficacy and safety of different drugs and treatment regimens, the efficacy on different location of mCNV, as well as the effects on practice in the real world. copy; 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.

N2  - Background: Papillorenal syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with mutations in the gene PAX2 and often presents with characteristic and specific optic disc findings, frequently with renal dysplasia. In at least half of cases, an identifiable mutation in the PAX2 gene can be detected. We report the ocular findings in a second case of papillorenal syndrome with the c.350 G > C (p.Arg117Pro) mutation detected within the PAX2 gene. Method(s): A case report of papillorenal syndrome due to PAX2 mutation. Complete ophthalmologic examination was performed as well as color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Genetic testing was performed using a next-generation sequencing with CNV calling (NGS-CNV) panel test containing 55 genes associated with nephrotic syndrome or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Result(s): An 11-year-old boy who presented with hypertension and proteinuria was found to have stage IV chronic kidney disease. Presenting visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. The fundus exam showed bilateral centrally excavated optic discs with absent central retinal vessels and a compensatory multiplicity of cilioretinal vessels, characteristic and specific for papillorenal syndrome. OCT showed outer retinal atrophy and macular schisis. Genetic testing identified the likely pathogenic c.350 G > C (p.Arg117Pro) mutation in PAX2. Conclusion(s): We report the first description, to our knowledge, of the clinical presentation, ocular and systemic findings, and ophthalmic imaging in an individual with papillorenal syndrome associated with the PAX2 c.350 G > C (p.Arg117Pro) mutation. Our case adds to the current understanding of papillorenal syndrome and demonstrates that this condition is associated with a pathognomonic optic disc appearance and significant renal disease.Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - We utilized the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database which was stemmed from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a retrospective cohort study investigating the risk of becoming dialysis dependent after receiving intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for retinal diseases. Patients newly receiving intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept from 2000 to 2017 for age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusions, or myopic choroid neovascularization were included as the study group, and patients with same retinal diseases but did not receive intravitreal anti-VEGFs served as controls extracted by age- and sex-matched (1:4) and further propensity score matching (PSM). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of dialysis. A cohort of 2447 anti-VEGF users and 2447 controls by PSM were evaluated. Higher dialysis risks were observed among patients newly receiving anti-VEGF agents compared to controls (adjusted HR: 1.849; 95% CI: 1.378-2.482) in the PSM cohort. For subgroup analysis, patients newly receiving anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic macular edema had significant risk (adjusted HR: 1.834; 95% CI: 1.448-2.324) of becoming dialysis-dependent, while patients in other subgroups demonstrated similar risks as the controls. In conclusion, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents might increase the risk of becoming dialysis-dependent, especially in patients who are treated for diabetic macular edema.

N2  - Myelinated retinal nerve fiber layer is a benign retinal condition that is usually an incidental finding in a healthy patient. Visual acuity is typically not compromised, but some cases have other associated ocular conditions that can affect vision. Diagnosis in challenging atypical cases requires imaging studies to rule out other pathologies. The authors describe the case of a 2-year-old girl who presented with atypical optic nerve fiber myelination.Copyright © SLACK Incorporated

N2  - PURPOSE: It is common for physicians to be uncertain when examining some images. Models trained with human uncertainty could be a help for physicians in diagnosing pathologic myopia. DESIGN: This is a hospital-based study that included 9176 images from 1327 patients that were collected between October 2015 and March 2019. METHOD(S): All collected images were graded by 21 myopia specialists according to the presence of myopic neovascularization (MNV), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM), and dome-shaped macula (DSM). Hard labels were made by the rule of major wins, while soft labels were possibilities calculated by whole grading results from the different graders. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics curve, the area under precision-recall (AUPR) curve, F-score, and least square errors were used to evaluate the performance of the models. RESULT(S): The AUC values of models trained by soft labels in MNV, MTM, and DSM models were 0.985, 0.946, and 0.978; and the AUPR values were 0.908, 0.876, and 0.653 respectively. However, 0.56% of MNV "negative" cases were answered as "positive" with high certainty by the hard label model, whereas no case was graded with extreme errors by the soft label model. The same results were found for the MTM (0.95% vs none) and DSM (0.43% vs 0.09%) models. CONCLUSION(S): The predicted possibilities from the models trained by soft labels were close to the results made by myopia specialists. These findings could inspire the novel use of deep learning models in the medical field.Copyright © 2021 Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology.

N2  - BMP4 variants have been reported to be associated with syndromic microphthalmia (MCOPS6, OMIM 607932). This study aims to describe BMP4 truncation mutations contributing to a novel phenotype in eight patients from four Chinese families. In this study, BMP4 variants were collected from a large dataset from in-house exome sequencing. Candidate variants were filtered by multiple in silico tools as well as comparison with data from multiple databases. Potential pathogenic variants were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing and cosegregation analysis. Four novel truncation variants in BMP4 were detected in four out of 7,314 unrelated probands with different eye conditions. These four mutations in the four families solely cosegregated in all eight patients with a specific form of pathologic myopia, characterized by significantly extended axial length, posterior staphyloma, macula patchy, chorioretinal atrophy, myopic optic neuropathy or glaucoma, vitreous opacity, and unique peripheral snow-grain retinopathy. The extreme rarity of the truncations in BMP4 (classified as intolerant in the gnomAD database, pLI = 0.96), the exclusive presence of these variants in the four families with pathologic myopia, variants fully co-segregated with the same specific phenotypes in eight patients from the four families, and the association of the pathogenicity of truncations with syndromic microphthalmia in previous studies, all support a novel association of BMP4 truncations with a specific form of pathologic myopia. The data presented in this study demonstrated that heterozygous BMP4 truncations contributed to a novel phenotype: pathologic myopia rather than microphthalmia. Mutations in the same gene resulting in both high myopia and microphthalmia have been observed for a few other genes like FZD5 and PAX6, suggesting bidirectional roles of these genes in early ocular development. Further studies are expected to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the bidirectional regulation.Copyright © 2021 Jiang, Ouyang, Li, Wang, Zhou, Li, Jia, Xiao, Sun, Wang and Zhang.

N2  - Background: With the advent of aging society of China, fundus diseases related to pathological neovascularization, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and pathological myopia (PM), have become an increasingly serious medical and health problems. As effective drugs of the treatment, conbercept and ranibizumab have been commonly used and covered by the national basic medical insurance in China. However, the pharmacoeconomic evaluation of conbercept vs. ranibizumab for DME and PM remains lacking. This study would assess the cost-effectiveness of conbercept and ranibizumab for the treatment of AMD, DME, and PM from the perspective of Chinese payers. Method(s): A Markov chain model was constructed based on the visual conditions of the patient indicated by the number of letters in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). We conducted models based on real-world scenario to calculate the cost per the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. A 1-year cycle length and a 10-year simulation treatment were applied and the number of injections of conbercept and ranibizumab was assumed to the average number within 10 years. Transition probabilities, costs, utility data, and other parameters were obtained from literature searches. A 3.5% discounting rate was applied for both the costs and utilities. Result(s): The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were more favorable for conbercept than ranibizumab in treatment of AMD, DME, and PM, with associated ICER of 66,669 renminbi (RMB), -258,813 RMB, and -373,185 RMB per QALY gained. Compared with ranibizumab, the incremental effectiveness of conbercept in treatment of AMD, DME, and PM was -0.665 QALYs, 0.215 QALYs, and 0.029 QALYs, respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed the same findings, although the ICER is sensitive to the costs of this program. Conclusion(s): Under the current Chinese healthcare setting, conbercept is suitable and cost-effective in treatment of AMD, DME, and PM compared with ranibizumab.Copyright © 2021 Cui, Zhou, Chang, Zhang, Wang, Meng, Liu and Yan.

N2  - Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesicles with a size of 30-150nm, contain many biological materials, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), proteins, and transcription factors. It has been identified in all biological fluids and recognized as an important part of intercellular communication. While the role of exosomes in cancer has been studied in-depth, our understanding of their relevance for ocular tissues has just begun to evolve. Intraocular fluids, including aqueous humor and vitreous humor, play a role in nourishing eye tissues and in expelling metabolites. In the pathological state, intraocular exosomes can mediate pathological processes such as ECM remodeling, retinal inflammation, and blood-retinal barrier dysfunction. Herein, we reviewed the latest advances of intraocular exosomes in the research of several eye diseases, including glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, myopia, and ocular tumors, and discuss how intraocular exosomes contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of multiple eye diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pathological myopia (PM) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. We aimed to evaluate microvascular and chorioretinal changes in different stages of myopia with wide-field (WF) swept-source (SS) optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). METHOD(S): This prospective cross-sectional observational study included 186 eyes of 122 patients who had undergone imaging between November 2018 and October 2020. Vessel density (VD) and vessel skeletonised density (VSD) of superficial capillary plexus, deep capillary plexus and whole retina, as well as foveal avascular zone parameters, retinal thickness (RT) and choroidal thickness (CT), were calculated. RESULT(S): This study evaluated 75 eyes of 48 patients with high myopia (HM), 43 eyes of 31 patients with mild to moderate myopia and 68 eyes of 53 age-matched controls. Controlling for age and the presence of systemic hypertension, we found that HM was associated with decrease in VD and VSD in all layers on 12x12 mm2 scans. Furthermore, HM was associated with a VD and VSD decrease in every Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid, with a larger decrease temporally (betaVD=-0.39, betaVSD=-10.25, p<0.01). HM was associated with decreased RT and CT. Reduction in RT was outside the macular region, while reduction in CT was in the macular region. CONCLUSION(S): Using WF SS-OCTA, we identified reduction in microvasculature and structural changes associated with myopia. Decrease in VD and VSD was greater in the temporal quadrant, and reductions in RT and CT were uneven across the retina. Further work may help identify risk factors for the progression of PM and associated vision-threatening complications.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. No commercial re-use.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the behavior of silicone oil (SiO) at a steady equilibrium and during saccades in pseudophakic highly myopic eyes with posterior staphyloma with and without an encircling band and compare it to behavior in emmetropic eyes. The SiO-retina contact area and shear stress were calculated by computational fluid dynamics. Method(s): A numerical model of an emmetropic eye and a myopic eye with and without scleral band underwent a saccade of 50degree/0.137 s. The vitreous chamber surface was divided into superior and inferior 180degree sectors: lens, pre-equator, post-equator, and macula. SiO-retina contact was evaluated as a function of fill percentages between 80% and 90% for standing, 45degree upward tilt, and supine patients. Maximum and average shear stress were calculated. Result(s): Overall, SiO-retina contact ranged between 40% and 83%; fill percentage varied between 80% and 95%. Neither the encircling scleral band nor the staphyloma significantly affected the SiO-retina contact area, although the presence of a scleral band proved disadvantageous when gazing 45degree upward. The inferior retina-SiO contact remained below 40% despite 95% SiO fill. The SS significantly increased at the scleral band indentation and decreased elsewhere. The staphyloma greatly reduced shear stress at the macula. Conclusion(s): The presence of a myopic staphyloma reduces shear stress at the macula but does not alter SiO-retina contact significantly. The apposition of a 360degree scleral band may reduce SiO-retina contact at least in some postures and increases the SS at the indentation. Translational Relevance: Assessing SiO-retina contact when vitreous chamber geometry changes according to pathologic or iatrogenic modifications allows accurate prediction of real-life tamponade behavior and helps explain surgical outcomes.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - The objective of this prospective study was to investigate the morphological changes of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) after treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor and to identify potential features predictive of the final BCVA. OCT and OCTA features were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Parameters investigated were the maturity pattern, presence of mCNV OCT activity signs, subretinal fibrosis and mCNV area. Forty patients (41 eyes) were included in the study. At the final visit, after a mean of 3.1+/-1.4 injections, BCVA had improved significantly (p=0.009) and subretinal hyperreflective exudation, subretinal fluid and intraretinal cysts nearly disappeared at 12 months. At baseline, 20 eyes had an immature CNV that were smaller, required less injections (2.5+/-1.2 vs 3.8+/-1.4, p=0.002), they completely regressed in seven eyes and achieved a better BCVA (0.14+/-0.15 vs 0.40+/-0.26 logMAR, p<0.001) when compared to mature CNV. Subretinal fibrosis developed in 19 eyes (46.3%) with lower final BCVA than eyes without fibrosis (0.19+/-0.24 vs 0.38+/-0.22 logMAR, p=0.012). Baseline immature pattern (p=0.005) and baseline BCVA (p<0.001) were predictive of final BCVA. Multimodal imaging is useful to define mCNV changes during treatment. OCTA provides prognostic information which cannot achieved by other imaging techniques.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: The prevalence of myopia is increasing globally, putting individuals at risk of myopia-associated visual impairment. Low-dose atropine eye drops have been found to safely reduce the risk of progression from myopia to higher levels of myopia and pathological states. In New Zealand, school children have an eye check at age 11. In this study, we aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of introducing photorefractive screening for myopia at age 11 in the New Zealand context, with atropine 0.01% eye drops treatment for those screening positive. Patients and Methods: A Markov cohort simulation was used to model the impact of screening plus atropine compared to usual care across a lifetime horizon and societal perspective with a 3% discount rate. Cost-effectiveness was determined by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with utility measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Multivariate sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate factors influencing cost-effectiveness. Result(s): The ICER for screening plus atropine was NZ$1590 (95% CI 1390, 1791) per QALY gained, with 7 cases of lifetime blindness prevented per 100,000 children screened. Conclusion(s): Screening for myopia with photorefraction at age 11 and atropine 0.01% eye drop treatment of children screening positive is likely to be cost-effective. These results suggest that a real-world trial and cost-effectiveness analysis would be worth considering in New Zealand.Copyright © 2022 Hong et al.

N2  - Background: Conbercept is a new anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drug. Here, we systematically conducted the efficacy, safety, compliance, and pharmacoeconomic evaluation of intravitreal conbercept (IVC) compared with other treatments in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), or pathologic myopia choroidal neovascularization (pmCNV). Method(s): Databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, SinoMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang Data were systematically searched from the inception to July 27, 2021. Randomized clinical trials and pharmacoeconomic studies comparing IVC with control groups in adults with nAMD, DME, or pmCNV were reviewed and selected. Meta-analyses were performed using the fixed-effects model when pooled data were homogeneous. Heterogeneous data were analyzed using the random-effects model. Primary outcomes included visual improvement rate, mean change in visual acuity or best corrected visual acuity, and pharmacoeconomic outcomes. Additional outcomes were the mean change in fundus examination values, adverse events (AEs), quality-of-life measures, and number of injections. Result(s): Among 3,591 screened articles, 22 original studies with 1,910 eyes of patients were finally included. For nAMD and DME, IVC was significantly associated with better visual acuity or best corrected visual acuity improvement and fundus quantitative measures than placebo, laser photocoagulation (LP), or intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVT). However, IVC showed non-inferior efficacy to intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) according to low quality of evidence, and there was lack of trials comparing the priority of IVC to other anti-VEGF regimens. No definitive increased risk of ocular or non-ocular AEs were observed in the study groups. All patients with AEs recovered after symptomatic treatments, and no severe AEs occurred. Patients treated with IVC might have higher quality-of-life scores than those in IVR in nAMD or LP in DME. Additionally, IVC showed cost-utility advantages in nAMD and cost-effectiveness advantages than IVR in pmCNV in China. Conclusion(s): IVC is well-tolerated and effective for improving vision acuity and quantitative measures in fundus condition in patients with nAMD and DME compared with LP, IVT, and placebo, but gains comparable efficacy to IVR. However, well-designed, large-sample, and long-term evaluation of IVC shall be conducted in additional studies worldwide.© Copyright © 2021 Zhou, Zheng, Wang, Men and Zhai.

N2  - PURPOSE. To identify the association between the choroidal thickness (ChT) with age and axial length (AL) under different refractive errors (REs) in Chinese adults. METHODS. Swept-source optical coherence tomography was used to measure ChT in 2126 right eyes of 2126 participants. The participants were classified as having pathologic myopia (PM), high myopia without PM (HM), low myopia (LM), and nonmyopia (non-M) according to their REs and META-PM (the Meta-Analysis of Pathologic Myopia) classification criteria. RESULTS. The mean age was 52.49 +/- 20.39 years (range, 18-93 years), and the mean RE was -5.27 +/- 5.37 diopters (D; range, -25.5 to +7.75 D). The mean average ChT was 159.25 +/- 80.75 mum and decreased in a linear relationship from non-M to PM (190.04 +/- 72.64 mum to 60.99 +/- 37.58 mum, P < 0.001). A significant decline in ChT was noted between 50 and 70 years (r = -0.302, P < 0.001) and less rapidly after the age of 70 years (r = -0.105, P = 0.024). No correlation was noted between age and ChT under 50 years (P = 0.260). A significantly higher association with AL was noted in the central fovea (betaHM = -23.92, betaLM = -23.88, betaNon-M = -18.80, all P < 0.001) and parafoveal ChT (betaHM = -22.87, betaLM = -22.31, betaNon-M = -18.61, all P < 0.001) when compared with the perifoveal region (betaHM = -19.80, betaLM = -18.29, betaNon-M = -13.95, all P < 0.001). Within each group of PM, HM, LM, and non-M, regression analysis showed that the coefficients of age and AL with different macular regions of ChT varied significantly. CONCLUSIONS. ChT was negatively correlated with age after 50 years. The thinning of the choroid was more prominent in the center and parafoveal regions as AL increased. Varied distributions of ChT decrease associated with AL and age were noted among different refractive groups.Copyright 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Blood vessel dysfunction causes several retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, macular degeneration and choroidal neovascularization in pathological myopia. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-neutralizing proteins provide benefits in most of those diseases, yet unsolved haemorrhage and frequent intraocular injections still bothered patients. Here, we identified endothelial CD146 as a new target for retinal diseases. CD146 expression was activated in two ocular pathological angiogenesis models, a laser-induced choroid neovascularization model and an oxygen-induced retinopathy model. The absence of CD146 impaired hypoxia-induced cell migration and angiogenesis both in cell lines and animal model. Preventive or therapeutic treatment with anti-CD146 antibody AA98 significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced aberrant retinal angiogenesis in two retinal disease models. Mechanistically, under hypoxia condition, CD146 was involved in the activation of NFkappaB, Erk and Akt signalling pathways, which are partially independent of VEGF. Consistently, anti-CD146 therapy combined with anti-VEGF therapy showed enhanced impairment effect of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Given the critical role of abnormal angiogenesis in retinal and choroidal diseases, our results provide novel insights into combinatorial therapy for neovascular fundus diseases.Copyright © 2021.

N2  - Purpose. To analyze the visual prognosis of macular buckling in patients with high myopia foveoschisis (FS) and to identify factors that predict the final visual outcome. Methods. We retrospectively included 155 eyes of 155 patients who underwent foveoschisis-related macular buckling. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and coexisting macular pathologies were assessed as a measure of surgical outcome, and multivariate linear regression was performed to identify factors affecting final visual prognosis. Results. The mean preoperative BCVA was 1.19 +/- 0.55 logMAR (20/308), while the mean postoperative BCVA was 0.82 +/- 0.51 logMAR (20/133) (P<0.001). Anatomical success was achieved in 151/155 eyes (97.42%) after the first surgery and in 155/155 eyes (100%) at the 2-year follow-up visit. Both preoperative and postoperative BCVA were better in eyes without macular hole (MH) than in eyes with MH. In patients with MH, the postoperative BCVA was significantly better than that before surgery when the MH was closed. However, the difference was not significant in patients with unclosed MH. Univariate analysis identified that baseline BCVA, age, MH, atrophic myopic maculopathy category, and postoperative intraretinal cyst were significantly related to BCVA at the postoperative 2-year follow-up. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative BCVA and age were significant factors. Conclusion. Better preoperative BCVA and younger age are predictors of better prognosis. Prompt surgery is advised for patients with myopic foveoschisis to improve their visual prognosis.Copyright © 2022 Xiujuan Zhao et al.

T1  - Prediction of different eye diseases based on fundus photography via deep transfer learning

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - With recent advancements in machine learning, especially in deep learning, the prediction of eye diseases based on fundus photography using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) has attracted great attention. However, studies focusing on identifying the right disease among several candidates, which is a better approximation of clinical diagnosis in practice comparing with the case that aims to distinguish one particular eye disease from normal controls, are limited. The performance of existing algorithms for multi-class classification of fundus images is at most mediocre. Moreover, in many studies consisting of different eye diseases, labeled images are quite limited mainly due to privacy concern of patients. In this case, it is infeasible to train huge DCNNs, which usually have millions of parameters. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize a lightweight deep learning architecture called MobileNetV2 and transfer learning to distinguish four common eye diseases, including Glaucoma, Maculopathy, Pathological Myopia, and Retinitis Pigmentosa, from normal controls using a small training data. We also apply a visualization approach to highlight the loci that are most related to the disease labels to make the model more explainable. The highlighted area chosen by the algorithm itself may give some hints for further fundus image studies. Our experimental results show that our system achieves an average accuracy of 96.2%, sensitivity of 90.4%, and specificity of 97.6% on the test data via five independent runs, and outperforms two other deep learning-based algorithms both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - The current standard treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularisation (mCNV) is in-travitreal injection of VEGF antagonists. This study was proposed to assess efficacy and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) for the treatment of mCNV across a 10-year follow-up. Thirty eyes of thirty patients with treatment-naive mCNV who underwent IVB and were followed up with for a minimum of ten years were recruited for the present retrospective cohort study. All participants were treated with three monthly IVB at baseline and then evaluated and treated under pro re nata (PRN) schedule. Outcome measures were to determine BCVA changes over years and identify the predictive factors of both final visual outcome and need for retreatment. Analysis of the main involved prognostic factors with correlations among variables is reported. Visual acuity remained stable at 10-year follow-up (p = 0.001) with the greatest improvement at 2 years (p < 0.0001) in all CNV locations. Baseline BCVA correlated positively with final BCVA (beta = 0.88, p < 0.0001, R2: 0.75). No predictive factors for the need of additional injections were identified. Retinal and choroidal thickness significantly reduced over time but without correlation with the number of injections. CNV max height and area significantly decreased at 10 years (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.003, respectively), with complete regression of mCNV lesion in 40% of subjects. Intravitreal bevacizumab resulted as long-term effective and safe therapy for mCNV with sustained results at 10 years.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesicles with a size of 30-150nm, contain many biological materials, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), proteins, and transcription factors. It has been identified in all biological fluids and recognized as an important part of intercellular communication. While the role of exosomes in cancer has been studied in-depth, our understanding of their relevance for ocular tissues has just begun to evolve. Intraocular fluids, including aqueous humor and vitreous humor, play a role in nourishing eye tissues and in expelling metabolites. In the pathological state, intraocular exosomes can mediate pathological processes such as ECM remodeling, retinal inflammation, and blood-retinal barrier dysfunction. Herein, we reviewed the latest advances of intraocular exosomes in the research of several eye diseases, including glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, myopia, and ocular tumors, and discuss how intraocular exosomes contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of multiple eye diseases.Copyright © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the 5-year cumulative incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy in the general population in Germany and to analyze potential risk factors. Design(s): The Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) is a population-based cohort study including 15 010 participants aged 35 to 74 years at baseline. Participant(s): A total of 494 eyes of 323 participants (mean age, 50.2 +/- 9.2 years; median, -7.25 diopters [D] myopic refractive error) without myopic maculopathy at baseline and 34 eyes of 27 subjects (mean age, 56.7 +/- 9.1 years; median, -8.75 D myopic refractive error) with myopic maculopathy met the inclusion conditions, phakic eyes with spherical equivalent <=-6 D (baseline), and had gradable fundus photographs at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Method(s): Myopic maculopathy incidence and progression were assessed by grading of fundus photographs according to a recent international photographic classification system (META-PM). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for progression of myopic maculopathy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Estimates for incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy. Result(s): The 5-year cumulative incidence of myopic maculopathy was 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-1.99; n = 1). Progression occurred in 17 of 34 eyes (50%) with prior myopic maculopathy over 5 years with 4 changes in category. The most common types of progression were enlargement of diffuse and patchy chorioretinal atrophy; a new pathology was present in 8 eyes. Higher intraocular pressure (IOP) (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.51-1.59; P = 0.035) was associated with progression of myopic maculopathy. Female gender (OR, 5.54; 95% CI, 0.93-32.92; P = 0.060) and higher myopic refractive error (OR, 1.62 per diopter; 95% CI, 0.99-1.49; P = 0.063) showed a tendency toward progression. Conclusion(s): Incidence of myopic maculopathy is rare in highly myopic eyes in the general population aged 35 to 74 years in Germany. Progression of myopic maculopathy in the German population occurred in 50% of highly myopic eyes. We presented population-based 5-year follow-up data on incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy in Europe.Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Introduction: Low vision and blindness make up the visual disability, one of the types of disability with the highest worldwide prevalence, and apparently the most frequent at a Colombian level. The conventional etiology of permanent and transitory deficiencies responsible for visual impairment such as glaucoma, cataract, infectious blindness and uncorrected ametropias, may be changing due to the presence of other entities and results of public health programs, and it is necessary to extend the etiological spectrum to both Ophthalmological causes as not ophthalmological. Objective(s): To identify the etiology and the most relevant clinical characteristics in an adult population with visual impairment. Material(s) and Method(s): Descriptive cross-sectional study in 96 adults with confirmed visual impairment. Result(s): 61% with low vision; in 55% the etiology of the visual deficiency was in the posterior segment, 21% in the anterior segment and 10% in the pathway and/or visual cortex. The most frequent individual pathologies: Pathological myopia, non-glaucomatous optic neuropathy, glaucoma and macular degeneration related to age. Conclusion(s): In this study, pathologies with posterior segment involvement occupied the most frequent etiologies related to visual disability, and the neuro ophthalmological and ocular trauma entities were identified as a potential source of visual deficiencies. It is necessary to continue carrying out studies that clarify whether the spectrum of conventional etiologies causing visual disability has changed, with the aim of redirecting programs of promotion, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation in low vision and blindness.Copyright © 2018 Sociedad Mexicana de Oftalmologia.

N2  - Pathologic myopia causes vision impairment and blindness, and therefore, necessitates a prompt diagnosis. However, there is no standardized definition of pathologic myopia, and its interpretation by 3D optical coherence tomography images is subjective, requiring considerable time and money. Therefore, there is a need for a diagnostic tool that can automatically and quickly diagnose pathologic myopia in patients. This study aimed to develop an algorithm that uses 3D optical coherence tomography volumetric images (C-scan) to automatically diagnose patients with pathologic myopia. The study was conducted using 367 eyes of patients who underwent optical coherence tomography tests at the Ophthalmology Department of Incheon St. Mary's Hospital and Seoul St. Mary's Hospital from January 2012 to May 2020. To automatically diagnose pathologic myopia, a deep learning model was developed using 3D optical coherence tomography images. The model was developed using transfer learning based on four pre-trained convolutional neural networks (ResNet18, ResNext50, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB4). Grad-CAM was used to visualize features affecting the detection of pathologic myopia. The performance of each model was evaluated and compared based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The model based on EfficientNetB4 showed the best performance (95% accuracy, 93% sensitivity, 96% specificity, and 98% AUROC) in identifying pathologic myopia.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the risk factors for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) through inter-eye comparisons of asymmetric ocular features in patients with unilateral MTM. Material(s) and Method(s): Highly myopic patients with unilateral MTM were enrolled in the study. The results of comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations, color fundus images, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were reviewed. MTM and myopic atrophic maculopathy was evaluated according to the ATN classification system. The status of the posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), posterior precortical vitreous pocket, vitreoretinal interface abnormalities, posterior staphyloma height (PSH), and the location of the protrusion of the sclera were assessed through OCT. Result(s): Among the 54 eyes of 27 patients 48.89 +/- 12.78 years of age, the affected eyes had worse best-corrected visual acuity, a longer axial length (AXL), greater PSH, and higher rates of posterior staphylomas, vitreovascular traction and epiretinal membranes (ERMs) than the fellow eyes (P < .001; P < .001; P < .001; P = .010; P = .002; P < .001). Thirteen cases present obvious anisometropia with an inter-eye AXL difference of more than 1 mm. In the 14 cases without obvious anisometropia, the eyes with MTM still had longer AXL, greater PSH and a higher ERMs rate than the fellow eyes (P = .039; P = .017; P = .001). Besides, in the 7 cases with an inter-eye AXL difference of less than 1 mm and asymmetrical stages of PVD, 5 cases with greater PVD in the affected eyes. Multiple risk factors coexisted in 96% of cases. Conclusion(s): In patients with unilateral MTM, a longer AXL, greater PSH, posterior staphyloma, vitreovascular traction, and ERMs were the main factors contributing to the occurrence of MTM. The process of PVD might involve in MTM development.Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Eye colour and colour perception are excellent examples to use when teaching genetics as they encompass not simply the basic Mendelian genetics of dominant, recessive and X-linked disorders, but also many of the new concepts such as non-allelic diseases, polygenic disease, phenocopies, genome-wide association study (GWAS), founder effects, gene-environment interaction, evolutionary drivers for variations, copy number variation, insertions deletions, methylation and gene inactivation. Beyond genetics, colour perception touches on concepts involving optics, physics, physiology and psychology and can capture the imagination of the population, as we saw with social media trend of "#the dress". Television shows such as Game of Thrones focused attention on the eye colour of characters, as well as their Dire-wolves and Dragons. These themes in popular culture can be leveraged as tools to teach and engage everyone in genetics, which is now a key component in all eye diseases. As the explosion of data from genomics, big data and artificial intelligence transforms medicine, ophthalmologists need to be genetically literate. Genetics is relevant, not just for Inherited Retinal Diseases and congenital abnormalities but also for the leading causes of blindness: age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, myopia, diabetic retinopathy and cataract. Genetics should be part of the armamentarium of every practicing ophthalmologist. We need to ask every patient about their family history. In the near future, patients will attend eye clinics with genetic results showing they are at high risk of certain eye diseases and ophthalmologists will need to know how to screen, follow and treat these patients.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: To explore the associations between refractive errors and multiple eye health outcomes. Method(s): This is an umbrella review based on systematic reviews with meta-analyses. In our study, refractive errors included myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and anisometropia. We reconducted the meta-analyses whose primary data were available in sufficient detail by random effect model. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2. The main outcomes included myopic macular degeneration (MMD), retinal detachment (RD), cataract, open-angle glaucoma (OAG), strabismus, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Result(s): Myopia was associated with increased risk of MMD (relative risk = 102.11, 95% CI 52.6-198.22), RD (3.45, 1.08-11.00), nuclear cataract (2.15, 1.53-3.03), posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract (1.74, 1.41-2.15), OAG (1.95, 1.74-2.19), exotropia (5.23, 2.26-12.09), but decreased risk of DR (0.83, 0.66-1.04), and early AMD (0.80, 0.67-0.94). From mild-to-high myopia, the association strengthened for MMD, RD, nuclear cataract, PSC cataract, OAG, and DR. Hyperopia was associated with an increased risk of early AMD (1.09, 1.01-1.18) and esotropia (22.94, 10.20-51.62). Astigmatism and anisometropia were associated with increased risk of both exotropia and esotropia. Conclusion(s): Myopia, especially high myopia, demonstrated the highest risk for eye health outcomes, such as MMD, RD, OAG, nuclear and PSC cataracts, and exotropia. However, myopia was associated with a lower risk of early AMD and DR. Individuals with hyperopia are more likely to suffer early AMD and esotropia. Astigmatism and anisometropia predispose to strabismus. A lot of research studies on the mechanism of the associations are needed.

N2  - Introduction: To describe the outcomes of retropupillary iris fixation of an iris claw Artisan Myopia intraocular lens (IOL), and to review literature on retropupillary iris fixation of iris claw models for myopia for the correction of aphakia and IOL dislocation in eyes with extremely high myopia. Method(s): Single-center, retrospective case series. Three patients (three eyes) with pathological myopia underwent retropupillary iris fixation of the iris claw Artisan Myopia model 204 for the correction of aphakia and IOL dislocation. After IOL power calculation, we found that the Artisan Aphakia IOL was not available for these patients. One patient had a history of previous extracapsular cataract extraction and two patients exhibited IOL-bag complex dislocation. The target lens power was calculated using ultrasound biometry and the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff theoretical and T2 formulae, with an A-constant of 103.8. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon. Visual outcomes were assessed at 12-48 months after surgery. Result(s): The mean axial length was 34.33 +/- 0.21 mm. The power of the implanted Artisan IOLs ranged between - 4.00 and - 3.00 diopter. The corrected distance visual acuity, measured in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution units, improved after surgery in all eyes, from 0.60 +/- 0.36 logMAR before surgery to 0.40 +/- 0.43 logMAR after surgery at 12 months postoperatively and remained stationary thereafter. There were no postoperative complications. Conclusion(s): Retropupillary iris fixation of Artisan Myopia IOLs may be a safe and effective surgical treatment option for the correction of aphakia and IOL dislocation in patients with extremely high myopia.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the inter-observer and intra-observer agreement of the myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) staging system (MSS). Method(s): The agreement test for MSS was based on the evaluation of 104 optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans from 104 myopic eyes. According to the MSS, six observers were asked to identify, in each image, one among four retinal patterns and one among three foveal patterns of MTM, the presence of an outer lamellar macular hole (OLMH) and an epiretinal membrane (ERM). Each observer repeated the agreement test after a 60 days interval. Result(s): Inter-observer reliability: the agreement of the test for the retina pattern was substantial (0.724), for the fovea pattern was 0.821, for the OLMH was 0.656, and for the ERM was 0.463. When all the criteria are included in the validation test the agreement was 0.657. Regarding the weighted statistics (Gwet's AC2, 95% CI), the validation test was statistically significant both when the variables were considered one by one, with an excellent agreement, respectively for the retina pattern (0.955) and the fovea pattern (0.963) and when all the variables were included in the tests (0.930). Intra-observer repeatability: all observers rerun the test after 2 months with a statistically significant percentage of confirmation of the previous test. Conclusion(s): The MSS offers in one Table information on diagnosis, natural history, function, prognosis, and management of MTM. The MSS is user-friendly and highly reproducible.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Ranibizumab is an FDA-approved drug used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and myopic choroidal neovascularization. Bevacizumab is another drug often used off-label to treat wet AMD. In order to reduce unwanted angiogenesis, ranibizumab and bevacizumab target circulating VEGF-A in the eye. Concentration levels in human vitreous and aqueous humor can be used to provide valuable efficacy information. However, vitreous and aqueous humor's aqueous environment, and vitreous humor's viscosity, as well as the stickiness of the analytes can provide bioanalytical challenges. In this manuscript, we describe the development, optimization, and fit-for-purpose validation of an LC-HRMS method designed for intact quantitative bioanalysis of ranibizumab and bevacizumab in human vitreous and aqueous humor following intravitreal administration. In order to fully develop this method, evaluations were conducted to optimize the conditions, including the data processing model (extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) vs deconvolution), carryover mitigation, sample preparation scheme optimization for surrogate and primary matrices, use of internal standard/immunocapture/deglycosylation, and optimization of the extraction and dilution procedure, as well as optimization of the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry conditions. Once the method was fully optimized, a fit-for-purpose validation was conducted, including matrix parallelism, with a linear calibration range of 10 to 200 microg/mL. The development of this intact quantitative method using LC-HRMS provides a proof-of-concept template for challenging, but valuable new and exciting bioanalytical techniques.Copyright © 2022.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the 2-year outcome to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy for myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the eyes with or without dome-shaped macula (DSM). METHOD(S): Data from treatment-naive myopic CNV with a 2-year follow-up were retrospectively collected and divided into two groups according to the presence of DSM. The best-corrected visual acuity was acquired at baseline, 3, 12, and 24 months. The association between visual outcomes and CNV type and area, presence of scleral-derived feeder vessel, macular atrophy, and lacquer cracks at baseline was also evaluated. RESULT(S): Fifty-four eyes of 54 patients were included; 18 eyes (33.4%) had DSM. Choroidal neovascularization was foveal in 10 DSM eyes (55.6%) and in 30 non-DSM eyes (83.9%), P = 0.033. At baseline, the mean best-corrected visual acuity was significantly higher in the DSM group (68.33 +/- 12.04 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, 20/40 Snellen) compared with the non-DSM group (57.75 +/- 13.46 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, 20/72 Snellen; P = 0.007). This difference disappeared after 3 months and did not reoccur afterward. All other parameters were not significantly associated with visual outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): Overall, DSM does not represent a negative prognostic factor in response to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy in myopic CNVs after 2 years. However, in DSM eyes, CNVs tend to be extrafoveal, thus ensuring a good visual prognosis from the earliest stage of the disease.

N2  - Early Onset High myopia (eoHM) (-6.00 diopters or less) is one of the leading cause of vision loss or even irreversible blindness with pathologic complications such as myopic retinopathy, maculopathy, retinal detachment, cataract or primary open-angle glaucoma that is present before the age of ten. In UMOG (Ophtalmogenetics Multidiciplinary Unit) we have designed and developed a novel and comprehensive screening strategy for all genes and loci responsible for eoHM on next-generation sequencing (NGS) developing a systematic application and automation in the clinical routine. UMOG is a multidisciplinary diagnosis and research team with extensive experience in diagnosis, research and teaching in ophthalmogenetic diseases in Hospital La Paz (Madrid). Samples were screened using a customized NGS gene panel, OFT-v3-1, containing 419 genes associated with eye pathology of suspected genetic origin, including eoHM genes and loci. The patients study was carried out on all the genes in the panel as it has been observed by other researches that a significant proportion of eoHM is caused by mutations in RetNet genes. This panel was validated with at least 25 samples with excellent results. At this point, we already ran 30 eoHM families and the diagnostic yield is around 30%. The development of this project will introduce the use of these new technologies to Health Services for diagnosis and research and thereby will help to improve the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with this and other genomic disorders. We are grateful to the patients and their families.

N2  - Objective: To determine the epidemiology and prevalence of myopic maculopathy and pathologic myopia and associated risk factors. Method(s): This is a retrospective cross-sectional observational study performed at an ophthalmology center, including 59 patients aged 7 to 70 years, and spherical equivalent higher than -6 diopters. Their retinographies were assessed by two ophthalmologists and an experienced retina specialist, using the META-PM study classification. Statistical analysis was performed using Matlab R2010, Excel 2010 and Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0, based on the result of multiple binary logistic regression analysis. Result(s): According to META-PM, the prevalence of myopic maculopathy in 100 eyes analyzed was 19% C0; 53% C1; 18% C2; 2% C3; 8% C4.The prevalence of pathologic myopia was 39%, and 37% of these eyes having myopic maculopathy category C1 with lesions plus, C2 or worse, or posterior staphyloma, and 2% in category smaller than C2, without lesions plus, but with posterior staphyloma.Multiple binary logistic regression analysis revealed an association between age and spherical equivalent inpathologic myopia (p<0.05), demonstrating the increase by 1 year in age implied in 1.05-fold (odds ratio=1.05) more likelyto present pathologic myopia (p<0.001; 95%CI 1.02-1.08).The increase by 1 diopter in the spherical equivalent higherthan -6 diopters, led to 1.19-fold (odds ratio=1.19) greater risk of presenting pathologic myopia (p=0.001; 95%CI 1.08-1.32).Finally, there was no association between sex and pathologic myopia (p=0.784). Conclusion(s):The META-PM study classification is an important tool to standardize myopic lesion staging, allowing comparison between studies and establishing management. Advanced age and myopic spherical equivalent are related to severity of myopic maculopathy and pathologic myopia.Copyright © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effect of vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and gas tamponade for myopic foveoschisis (MF), and analysed prognosis with different gas tamponade. METHOD(S): Retrospective, non-randomized study. The records of patients with MF treated by vitrectomy, were reviewed. Patients were followed up postoperatively mean 16.74months, to record changes of Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central foveal thickness (CFT). RESULT(S): Sixty-two eyes (59 patients) were analysed in total, with mean age of 55.29+/-10.34years, 49 females (83.1%). Foveoschisis completely resolved in all eyes at least 6months post vitrectomy, except for two postoperative full-thickness macular holes (FTMH). Final BCVA improved significantly from 0.69+/-0.39 to 0.44+/-0.42 logMAR, and CFT from 502.47+/-164.78 to 132.67+/-52.26mum. Patients were subdivided into three subgroups based on the different endotamponades used (C3F8, C2F6, and air). Baseline BCVA, baseline CFT and foveal detachment (FD) were not significantly different among the three groups. Eyes treated with air tamponade had better visual outcomes than eyes with C3F8 tamponade (P =0.008). Baseline BCVA and FD were significant risk factors for postoperative BCVA (P<0.001 and P =0.013, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Vitrectomy with ILM peeling and gas tamponade results in good functional and anatomic outcomes in the treatment of most MF. Good vision and no-FD pre-surgery are related with good visual prognosis. Air tamponade can provide as good visual recovery as expansive gas, and reduce postoperative complications.Copyright © 2022.

N2  - PURPOSE. To identify structural abnormalities in the papillary and peripapillary area in eyes with pathologic myopia (PM) and normal IOP and to determine their relationship to visual field (VF) defects. METHODS. One hundred eight eyes of 70 patients with PM were retrospectively studied. The disc-centered swept source optical coherence tomographic images and the Goldmann VF recorded within 1 year of the optical coherence tomographic examination were analyzed. Four structural abnormalities were identified: lamina cribrosa (LC) defects, ridge protrusions, intrachoroidal cavitations (ICC), and prelaminar schisis. The correspondence of the VF defects with the structural abnormalities was assessed. RESULTS. The mean age, axial length, and optic disc area of the 108 eyes were 58.7 +/- 10.0 years, 31.1 +/- 2.4 mm, and 4.7 +/- 2.2 mm2, respectively. Eighty-five of the 108 eyes (78.7%) had at least one abnormality and 49.4% (42/85) had two or more abnormalities. LC defects, ridge protrusions, ICC, and prelaminar schisis were detected in 47.2%, 33.3%, 21.3%, and 30.6% of the eyes, respectively. VF defects at the corresponding areas of these structural abnormalities were seen in 63% of the eyes with LC defects, 39% of the eyes with ridge protrusions, and 21% of the eyes with ICC. CONCLUSIONS. Four kinds of structural abnormalities with corresponding VF defects are commonly observed in the papillary and peripapillary region of eyes with PM. The presence of these abnormalities suggests a possibility of functional damage.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  - Background/aims To apply deep learning technology to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can identify vision-Threatening conditions in high myopia patients based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) macular images. Methods In this cross-sectional, prospective study, a total of 5505 qualified OCT macular images obtained from 1048 high myopia patients admitted to Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre (ZOC) from 2012 to 2017 were selected for the development of the AI system. The independent test dataset included 412 images obtained from 91 high myopia patients recruited at ZOC from January 2019 to May 2019. We adopted the InceptionResnetV2 architecture to train four independent convolutional neural network (CNN) models to identify the following four vision-Threatening conditions in high myopia: retinoschisis, macular hole, retinal detachment and pathological myopic choroidal neovascularisation. Focal Loss was used to address class imbalance, and optimal operating thresholds were determined according to the Youden Index. Results In the independent test dataset, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were high for all conditions (0.961 to 0.999). Our AI system achieved sensitivities equal to or even better than those of retina specialists as well as high specificities (greater than 90%). Moreover, our AI system provided a transparent and interpretable diagnosis with heatmaps. Conclusions We used OCT macular images for the development of CNN models to identify vision-Threatening conditions in high myopia patients. Our models achieved reliable sensitivities and high specificities, comparable to those of retina specialists and may be applied for large-scale high myopia screening and patient follow-up.Copyright ©

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the percentages and risk factors for visual impairment (VI) across age groups in a highly myopic cohort with a wide range of age (18-93 years). Method(s): A total of 2099 eyes (1220 participants) were enrolled. All participants underwent detailed ocular examinations. Myopic maculopathy (MM) was assessed as myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) or myopic neovascular maculopathy (MNM) based on the ATN system. Result(s): Most participants younger than 50 years had normal vision, while the cumulative risk of VI and blindness gradually increased after 50-59 years. The percentage of each type of MM increased nonlinearly with ageing (all p < 0.001), with an accelerated period of increase after 45 years for MAM, and after 50 years for MTM and MNM. Axial length (AL) >=30 mm was the only associated factor for mild VI or worse in participants aged 18-39 years (p < 0.001). Older age, AL >=30 mm and the presence of MAM were predictors for mild VI or worse in the group aged 40-49 years (all p < 0.05). In participants aged >=50 years, older age, female sex, longer AL and increased severity of MM were risk factors for VI and blindness (all p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The percentages of MM and related VI increased nonlinearly with older age, with a turning point at 45 years for MAM, preceding that of MTM, MNM and VI by 5 years, warranting future longitudinal studies to confirm. Different age groups presented different risk factors for VI. Timely screening should be in place for middle-aged high myopes.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the characteristics of macular structures and microcirculation of posterior staphyloma (PS) and explored factors related to PS in eyes with high myopia. Method(s): There were 114 eyes of 82 patients in this study. Using 1:1 matching of the axial length of myopic eyes, patients were divided into no PS (NPS) and PS groups. Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations were performed on all patients. Structural parameters were acquired using swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). OCT angiography (OCTA) was used to measure the microcirculation parameters. Generalized estimated equation and linear correlation analysis were used for the statistical analysis. Result(s): Patients with PS had a thinner retinal thickness (RT) and choroid thickness (CT) (all p < 0.05) in the measurement areas and a significantly lower subfoveal scleral thickness (SFST) (p < 0.001) than those without PS. Retinal deep vascular complex density (DVD) (all p < 0.05) and choriocapillaris perfusion area (CCPA) (all p < 0.001) were significantly lower in the measurement areas of the PS group than in those of the NPS group. There was no significant difference in the retinal superficial vascular density between the two groups. Generalized estimating equation indicated that SFST (B = 0.079, p = 0.001), parafoveal RT (B = -0.162, p = 0.041), foveal CT (B = 0.292, p = 0.013), parafoveal CT (B = -0.157, p = 0.023), foveal CCPA (B = 0.691, p = 0.003) and parafoveal CCPA (B = -0.026, p = 0.004) were significantly correlated with PS. Age (r = -0.323, p = 0.001), spherical equivalent refraction (SER) (r = 0.289, p = 0.004), subfoveal CT (r = 0.398, p < 0.001), foveal DVD (r = 0.346, p < 0.001), foveal CT (r = 0.429, p < 0.001), and foveal CCPA (r = 0.387, p < 0.001) were strongly correlated with SFST. Conclusion(s): The macular structures and microcirculation in the PS group were different from those in the NPS group. SFST, CT, and CCPA were significantly correlated with PS. Lower SFST in PS was correlated with abnormalities of CT and microcirculation.Copyright © 2022 Li, Wang, Liu, Wang, He, Chen and Wei.

Optical coherence tomography angiography was done to obtain RPC density and pRNFL thickness, superficial retinal capillary plexus (SRCP), and deep retinal capillary plexus (DRCP) density. The axial length (AL) was measured. Correlations among BCVA, RPC density, pRNFL thickness, AL, and other parameters were determined. Result(s): For pathological myopia, the densities of RPC, SRCP, and DRCP were significantly less than those of the control and simple high myopia groups (p <= 0.005). There was no statistical difference in pRNFL thickness between pathological myopia and simple high myopia (p = 0.063), whereas there was significant difference in global pRNFL thickness between pathological myopia and control (p = 0.008). The global RPC density showed the greatest area under the curve (AUC = 0.962, sensitivity = 94.74%, specificity = 90.00%, cutoff value = 47.8%) for pathological myopia, whereas the AUC of pRNFL thickness, SRCP, and DRCP were only 0.675, 0.824, and 0.865, respectively. The univariate and multiple linear regression models showed that RPC density, SRCP density, and AL were correlated with BCVA (All p < 0.05). In the final BCVA model with multiple generalized estimating equation analysis, AL, RPC density and interaction between RPC and AL were shown (all p < 0.03). For an eye with AL >= 27.94 mm, global RPC density was predicted to be less than 48.77% with a high risk of visual impairment. Conclusion(s): Peripapillary alterations, both the decreasing RPC density and pRNFL thickness, occurred in pathological myopia compared with the control. The RPC density was associated with BCVA, and this relationship was affected by AL.Copyright © 2022 Ye, Lin, Shen, Chen, Zhang, Lu and Shao.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the predictive factors for myopic macular degeneration (MMD) and progression in adults with myopia. METHOD(S): We examined 828 Malay and Indian adults (1579 myopic eyes) with myopia (spherical equivalent (SE) <=-0.5 dioptres) at baseline who participated in both baseline and 12-year follow-up visits of the Singapore Malay Eye Study and the Singapore Indian Eye Study. Eye examinations, including subjective refraction and axial length (AL) measurements, were performed. MMD was graded from fundus photographs following the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia classification. The predictive factors for MMD development and progression were assessed in adults without and with MMD at baseline, respectively as risk ratios (RR) using multivariable modified Poisson regression models. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to visualise the performance of the predictive models for the development of MMD, with performance quantified by the area under the curve (AUC). RESULT(S): The 12-year cumulative MMD incidence was 10.3% (95% CI 8.9% to 12.0%) among 1504 myopic eyes without MMD at baseline. Tessellated fundus was a major predictor of MMD (RR=2.50, p<0.001), among other factors including age, worse SE and longer AL (all p<0.001). The AUC for prediction of MMD development was found to be 0.78 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.80) for tessellated fundus and increased significantly to an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.88) with the combination of tessellated fundus with age, race, gender and SE (p<0.001). Older age (p=0.02), worse SE (p<0.001) and longer AL (p<0.001) were found to be predictors of MMD progression. CONCLUSION(S): In adults with myopia without MMD, tessellated fundus, age, SE and AL had good predictive value for incident MMD. In adults with MMD, 1 in 10 eyes experienced progression over the same period. Older age, more severe myopia and longer AL were independent risk factors for progression.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

N2  - To investigate optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) biomarkers for good visual outcomes in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) following anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. Patients diagnosed with mCNV via multimodal imaging were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographic data and biomarkers were collected. Anti-VEGF treatment based on a pro re nata (PRN) regimen was conducted on all eyes. The visual gains of>=15 ETDRS letters or<15 letters at 12-month were classified into two groups. Regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with significant best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement. Among 34 patients, 17 eyes and 17 eyes were classified into the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in qualitative OCTA biomarkers between the two groups. The>=15 letters group had significantly thicker subfoveal choroid thickness (SFCT) (79.97+/-33.15 vs. 50.66+/-18.31, P=0.003), more ellipsoid zone integrity (58.8% vs. 23.5%, P=0.037) and lower levels of fractal dimension (1.45+/-0.101 vs. 1.53+/-0.082, P=0.031) than the<15 letters group. SFCT and the ellipsoid zone integrity were correlated with 15 letters or more VA improvement in both univariable and multivariable analyses (P=0.023 and P=0.044, respectively). Thicker SFCT and integrity of the ellipsoid zone at baseline were associated with greater visual gains at 12 months. OCTA biomarkers seem to play a less important role in predicting the visual outcome of mCNV.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose:To determine the prevalence and characteristics of multifocal choroiditis/punctate inner choroidopathy (MFC/PIC) in eyes with patchy atrophy because of pathologic myopia. Method(s):Five hundred eyes of 253 patients with patchy atrophy were examined between 2014 and 2020 at the Advanced Clinical Center for Myopia. The main outcome measures included the prevalence and characteristics of active MFC/PIC lesions diagnosed by optical coherence tomography. Result(s):Fifty-five of the 500 eyes (11%) diagnosed with patchy atrophy had optical coherence tomography features of active MFC/PIC lesions, such as focal elevations of the retinal pigment epithelium filled with medium hyperreflectivity material, curvilinear scars (Schlaegel lines), and/or areas of outer retinal atrophy. At the time when the MFC/PIC was diagnosed, the mean age was 57.3 +/- 12.0 years, and the mean axial length was 29.2 +/- 1.8 mm. Macular neovascularization was found in 45 of eyes (81.8%) with MFC/PIC versus 151 eyes without such findings (33.9%; P < 0.001). In 25 of the 55 eyes (45.5%), active MFC/PIC lesions were found before the development of the patchy atrophy. The Bruch membrane defects were colocated with these lesions. Conclusion(s):Active MFC/PIC lesions were identified in a minority of eyes with pathologic myopia, and a subset of these lesions were observed to progress to findings indistinguishable from myopic patchy atrophy. Evidence of MFC/PIC in eyes with pathologic myopia appeared to be a risk factor for the development of macular neovascularization.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the long-term surgical outcomes and prognostic factors of foveal detachment (FD) in pathological myopia. METHOD(S): This retrospective observational study included 59 patients with FD (61 eyes) who underwent pars plana vitrectomy at Shanghai General Hospital between June 2017 and July 2018 with follow-up for at least 24 months. Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and swept-source optical coherence tomography, were assessed. Preoperative myopic maculopathy was evaluated according to the ATN classification. RESULT(S): FD completely resolved in 59 of 61 eyes (96.7%). Mean duration of retinal reattachment was 12.10+/-8.10 months. Mean logMAR BCVA improved from 1.34+/-0.52 to 0.83+/-0.43 at 24 months postoperatively (P<0.001). Secondary macular hole occurred in 8 eyes (13.1%) with a mean period of 3.4+/-4.1 weeks after primary surgery. In regression analyses, baseline myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM) (B=0.213, P=0.005) and vitreomacular traction (VMT) (B=0.292, P=0.007) were adverse prognostic factors for postoperative BCVA. A more severe MAM revealed a delay in retinal reattachment (B=5.670, P=0.002). FD eyes with VMT (OR=1.309, P=0.003) or outer lamellar macular hole (O-LMH) (OR=1.369, P<0.001) were risk factors for postoperative secondary macular hole. CONCLUSION(S): Vitrectomy was effective in the long-term for treating FD. Careful consideration is needed for those with VMT or O-LMH due to the high risk of secondary macular hole after vitrectomy. FD eyes with more severe MAM tended to have poorer postoperative BCVA and extended periods of retinal reattachment.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to establish and validate optical coherence tomography (OCT) based diagnostic criteria of high myopia. METHOD(S): This was a cross-sectional study including 100 eyes of high myopia with axial length larger than 26.5 mm and 100 control eyes, which were examined by spectral-domain OCT. Vertical and horizontal OCT of 9 mm scanning across fovea were analyzed. OCT characteristics including mirror artifact, scleral sink due to steep inclination of posterior sclera, scleral visibility, abnormality of outer retinal layer, foveoschisis, and dome-shaped macula were assessed in each group. RESULT(S): The mean axial length was 28.65 +/- 2.07 mm (range, 26.51-34.59 mm) in high myopia group and 23.79 +/- 0.99 mm (range, 21.26-25.94 mm) in control group. Among the OCT characteristics noted at high frequency in the eyes with high myopia, three criteria achieving high sensitivity and specificity were determined: scleral sink over 500 mum, scleral visibility over 100 mum, and dome-shaped macula. Under conditions of presence of any of three criteria in either horizontal or vertical OCT scanning, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for high myopia were found to be 95.0%, 98.0%, 98.0%, and 95.1%, respectively. In a new set of OCT images from 50 eyes with high myopia and 50 eyes of nonhigh myopia cases, the OCT-based criteria also proved similar level of diagnostic validity. CONCLUSION(S): The OCT-based criteria, which directly addressed posterior scleral contour changes, may lead to an intuitive and accurate diagnosis of high myopia. Also, the criteria may contribute to early detection and monitoring of eyes that cannot be defined as high myopia but can progress. OCT may be useful for monitoring high myopia patients as OCT can detect myopia-associated retinal pathologies as well as scleral contour changes.

N2  - Training and Research Hospital, Department of Medical Genetics, Gyrate atrophy (GA) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder with an ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) enzyme deficiency, characterized by progressive and degenerative chorioretinal findings. The main complaints of GA patients during ophthalmologic examinations are a low vision, night blindness, and peripheral vision loss. Posterior subcapsular cataract, myopia, choroidal neovascularization, epiretinal membrane, and intraretinal cysts are the possible accompanying vision loss reasons. We report a patient with GA who had applied to our clinic with vision loss (20/100 for Snellen best-corrected visual acuity) secondary to posterior subcapsular cataract and intraretinal cysts in the retina. He was followed with an only topical treatment of brinzolamide (b.i.d) and nepafenac (t.i.d) eye drops without any diet modification or supplementation. One month after this treatment, we observed a significant resolution in his macular edema with 2 and 1 Snellen lines of visual gain in his right and left eye, respectively. Also, we detected a novel homozygous mutation in the Genetic assessment of the OAT gene: C.1253T>C (p.Leu418Pro). Recently, GA doesn't have unique and well-known therapy. Diet, vitamin supplements, systemic or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most used treatments for macular edema or retinal cysts. The benefit of these treatments is variable. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and/or NSAIDs may be useful to control macular edema and the genetic variants may be also a determinant in the responsiveness of the type of treatment.

N2  - The emerging ultra-wide field of view (UWF) fundus color imaging is a powerful tool for fundus screening. However, manual screening is labor-intensive and subjective. Based on 2644 UWF images, a set of early fundus abnormal screening system named DeepUWF is developed. DeepUWF includes an abnormal fundus screening subsystem and a disease diagnosis subsystem for three kinds of fundus diseases (retinal tear & retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy and pathological myopia). The components in the system are composed of a set of excellent convolutional neural networks and two custom classifiers. However, the contrast of UWF images used in the research is low, which seriously limits the extraction of fine features of UWF images by depth model. Therefore, the high specificity and low sensitivity of prediction results have always been difficult problems in research. In order to solve this problem, six kinds of image preprocessing techniques are adopted, and their effects on the prediction performance of fundus abnormal and three kinds of fundus diseases models are studied. A variety of experimental indicators are used to evaluate the algorithms for validity and reliability. The experimental results show that these preprocessing methods are helpful to improve the learning ability of the networks and achieve good sensitivity and specificity. Without ophthalmologists, DeepUWF has potential application value, which is helpful for fundus health screening and workflow improvement.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Background: Myopia is one of the most common causes of vision impairment in children and adults and has become a public health priority with its growing prevalence worldwide. This study aims to identify and evaluate the global trends in myopia research of the past century and visualize the frontiers using bibliometric analysis. Method(s): The literature search was conducted on the Web of Science for myopia studies published between 1900 and 2020. Retrieved publications were analyzed in-depth by the annual publication number, prolific countries and institutions, core author and journal, and the number of citations through descriptive statistics. Collaboration networks and keywords burst were visualized by VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Myopia citation network was visualized using CitNetExplorer. Result(s): In total, 11,172 publications on myopia were retrieved from 1900 to 2020, with most published by the United States. Saw SM, from the National University of Singapore, contributed the most publications and citations. Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science was the journal with highest number of citations. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery with the maximum number of publications. The top 10 cited papers mainly focused on the epidemiology of myopia. Previous research emphasized myopia-associated experimental animal models, while recent keywords include "SMILE" and "myopia control" with the stronger burst, indicating a shift of concern from etiology to therapy and coincided with the global increment of incidence. Document citation network was clustered into six groups: "prevalence and risk factors of myopia," "surgical control of myopia," "pathogenesis of myopia," "optical interventions of myopia," "myopia and glaucoma," and "pathological myopia." Conclusion(s): Bibliometrics analysis in this study could help scholars comprehend global trends of myopia research frontiers better. Hundred years of myopia research were clustered into six groups, among which "prevalence and risk factors of myopia" and "surgical control of myopia" were the largest groups. With the increasing prevalence of myopia, interventions of myopia control are a potential research hotspot and pressing public health issue.Copyright © 2022 Shan, Dong, Chen, Su and Wan.

N2  - Background: Myopic macular degeneration (MMD) is a primary cause of blindness and visual impairment in many parts of the world. A review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for intervention selection are required with the increasing demand for MMD management in clinical practice as well as in national health services. Therefore, we aim to systematically review CPGs for MMD and assist the recommendations development of the Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI) program of the World Health Organization. Method(s): A systematic review of CPGs published on MMD between 2010 and April 2020 was conducted. Guidelines were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. Cochrane systematic reviews were also included when the evidence from included CPGs were inadequate or contradict. Result(s): After applying exclusion criteria and conducting the quality appraisal, two CPGs were finally included. The average of the AGREE II ratings for the identified Guidelines were 56 and 63 respectively (7 for each item). To provide further information on interventions for MMD, one Cochrane review on MMD was additionally identified and included in the study. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs were recommended for patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) as first-line therapy to improve vision and reduce central macular thickness, and ranibizumab showed significant effectiveness compared to photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT was recommended to be performed in those resistant to the treatment by one CPG but lacked of adequate description and support. Data extracted from the Cochrane systematic reviews indicated that anti-VEGF therapy for mCNV had significant effectiveness in improving visual acuity and reducing CMT compared to PDT with moderate to low certainty of evidence. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab were considered as equally effective with moderate certainty. Conclusion(s): The outcomes of this review suggest that high quality clinical practice guidelines for MMD management are limited. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents was recommended as an effective intervention to treat myopic CNV as the first-line treatment, while there was inadequate guidance for the application of PDT in myopic CNV management. The use of other interventions for MMD were not recommended at this time and additional evidence is called for.Copyright © 2022 by the Journal of Global Health. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: To develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can predict optical coherence tomography (OCT)-derived high myopia grades based on fundus photographs. Method(s): In this retrospective study, 1,853 qualified fundus photographs obtained from the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) were selected to develop an AI system. Three retinal specialists assessed corresponding OCT images to label the fundus photographs. We developed a novel deep learning model to detect and predict myopic maculopathy according to the atrophy (A), traction (T), and neovascularisation (N) classification and grading system. Furthermore, we compared the performance of our model with that of ophthalmologists. Result(s): When evaluated on the test set, the deep learning model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.969 for category A, 0.895 for category T, and 0.936 for category N. The average accuracy of each category was 92.38% (A), 85.34% (T), and 94.21% (N). Moreover, the performance of our AI system was superior to that of attending ophthalmologists and comparable to that of retinal specialists. Conclusion(s): Our AI system achieved performance comparable to that of retinal specialists in predicting vision-threatening conditions in high myopia via simple fundus photographs instead of fundus and OCT images. The application of this system can save the cost of patients' follow-up, and is more suitable for applications in less developed areas that only have fundus photography.Copyright © 2022 Wu, Cai, Xie, Chen, Wang, Lei, Zheng and Lu.

N2  - Importance: High myopia incidence and prevalence is increasing worldwide, and the visual burden caused by myopia is expected to rise accordingly. Studies investigating the occurrence of myopic complications in individuals of European ancestry with high myopia are scarce, hampering insights into the frequency of myopic retinal complications in European individuals and their visual burden. Objective(s): To assess the frequency of myopic macular features in individuals of European ancestry with high myopia. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cross-sectional analysis of the Dutch Myopia Study (MYST) and individuals with high myopia from the Rotterdam Study (RS) included 626 patients with high myopia (spherical equivalent of refractive error [SER] <=-6 diopters [D] or axial length [AL] >=26 mm) who underwent an extensive ophthalmic examination including multimodal retinal imaging. In addition to this combination of a population-based cohort study and mix-based high myopia study, a systematic literature review was also performed to compare findings with studies of individuals of Asian ancestry. Exposures: High myopia, age, and AL. Main Outcomes and Measures: Frequency of myopic macular and optic disc features: tessellated fundus, myopic macular degeneration (MMD), staphyloma, peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation, peripapillary atrophy (PPA), and "plus" lesions (choroidal neovascularization, Fuchs spot, and lacquer cracks). Result(s): The mean (SD) SER of the combined study population (MYST and RS) was -9.9 (3.2) D; the mean (SD) age was 51.4 (15.1) years, and 387 (61.8%) were women. The prevalence of MMD was 25.9% and increased with older age (P for trend <.001), lower SER (odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65-0.76; P <.001), and higher AL (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 2.13-3.06; P <.001). Choroidal neovascularization or Fuchs spot was present in 2.7% (n = 17), both lesions in 0.3% (n = 2), and lacquer cracks in 1.4% (n = 9). Staphyloma, PPA, and MMD were highly prevalent in visual impaired and blind eyes (frequency was 73.9% [20 of 27], 90.5% [19 of 21], and 63.0% [17 of 27] of unilateral blind eyes for MMD, staphyloma, and PPA, respectively). Seven previous studies in Asian populations reported a variable MMD frequency ranging from 8.3% to 64%, but frequencies were similar for comparable risk profiles based on age and SER. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of a highly myopic Dutch population of European ancestry, myopic retinal features were frequent; were associated with age, SER, and AL; and occurred in all visually severely impaired eyes. The absence of treatment options for most of these retinal complications emphasizes the need for effective strategies to prevent high myopia..Copyright © 2022 American Medical Association.

N2  - Purpose: The prevalence of myopia is increasing around the world, stimulating interest in methods to slow its progression. The primary justification for slowing myopia progression is to reduce the risk of vision loss through sight-threatening ocular pathologic features in later life. The article analyzes whether the potential benefits of slowing myopia progression by 1 diopter (D) justify the potential risks associated with treatments. Method(s): First, the known risks associated with various methods of myopia control are summarized, with emphasis on contact lens wear. Based on available data, the risk of visual impairment and predicted years of visual impairment are estimated for a range of incidence levels. Next, the increased risk of potentially sight-threatening conditions associated with different levels of myopia are reviewed. Finally, a model of the risk of visual impairment as a function of myopia level is developed, and the years of visual impairment associated with various levels of myopia and the years of visual impairment that could be prevented with achievable levels of myopia control are estimated. Result(s): Assuming an incidence of microbial keratitis between 1 and 25 per 10 000 patient-years and that 15% of cases result in vision loss leads to the conclusion that between 38 and 945 patients need to be exposed to 5 years of wear to produce 5 years of vision loss. Each additional 1 D of myopia is associated with a 58%, 20%, 21%, and 30% increase in the risk of myopic maculopathy, open-angle glaucoma, posterior subcapsular cataract, and retinal detachment, respectively. The predicted mean years of visual impairment ranges from 4.42 in a person with myopia of -3 D to 9.56 in a person with myopia of -8 D, and a 1-D reduction would lower these by 0.74 and 1.21 years, respectively. Conclusion(s): The potential benefits of myopia control outweigh the risks: the number needed to treat to prevent 5 years of visual impairment is between 4.1 and 6.8, whereas fewer than 1 in 38 will experience a loss of vision as a result of myopia control.Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the characteristics of macular outward scleral height (MOSH) in different grades of myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM) and explore the risk factors for MTM. Method(s): A total of 188 eyes (188 participants) with high myopia were divided into the no MTM (nMTM) group and the MTM group, which was further graded into foveoschisis, foveal detachment, full-thickness macular hole, and macular hole with retinal detachment. Swept-source optical coherence tomography was used to measure the MOSH. Result(s): No significant differences were found in axial length between the nMTM and MTM groups (p = 0.295). The MOSH was significantly higher in the MTM group (p < 0.001), which was identified as a risk factor for MTM (OR = 1.108, p < 0.001). The proportion of eyes with severe atrophic myopic maculopathy (AMM) was higher in the MTM group (28.48%) (p = 0.003). The macular hole with foveoschisis (MH/FS+) subgroup presented a higher average MOSH (p = 0.012) and more severe AMM (p = 0.009) than the macular hole without foveoschisis (MH/FS-) subgroup. Conclusion(s): MOSH would be more suitable for estimating MTM occurrence than axial length. The grading of AMM helps to evaluate the severity of MTM. The categorization of MH/FS- as a distinct grade from MH/FS+ might be preferable.Copyright © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Pathologic myopia is a severe form of myopia that can lead to permanent visual impairment. The recent global increase in the prevalence of myopia has been projected to lead to a higher incidence of pathologic myopia in the future. Thus, imaging myopic eyes to detect early pathological changes, or predict myopia progression to allow for early intervention, has become a key priority. Recent advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) have contributed to the new grading system for myopic maculopathy and myopic traction maculopathy, which may improve phenotyping and thus, clinical management. Widefield fundus and OCT imaging has improved the detection of posterior staphyloma. Non-invasive OCT angiography has enabled depth-resolved imaging for myopic choroidal neovascularisation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great performance in detecting pathologic myopia and the identification of myopia-associated complications. These advances in imaging with adjunctive AI analysis may lead to improvements in monitoring disease progression or guiding treatments. In this review, we provide an update on the classification of pathologic myopia, how imaging has improved clinical evaluation and management of myopia-associated complications, and the recent development of AI algorithms to aid the detection and classification of pathologic myopia.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

N2  - Therapeutic inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) action has emerged as a potential approach for managing several diseases, including myopia. Herein, we analyzed the role of HIF-1alpha in the progression of pathologic myopia by regulating the miR-150-5p/LAMA4/p38 MAPK axis. Microarray-based gene expression profiling of pathologic myopia was employed to identify differentially expressed genes. Human scleral fibroblasts (HSFs) were cultured under the hypoxic conditions. Interaction among HIF-1alpha, miR-150-5p, and LAMA4 was identified. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed in hypoxia-exposed HSFs to evaluate the effect of the HIF-1alpha/miR-150-5p/LAMA4/p38 MAPK axis on the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation of HSFs and the subsequent pathologic myopia progression. Increased LAMA4 but decreased miR-150-5p was found in serum sample of pathologic myopia patients. HIF-1alpha and LAMA4 were abundantly expressed, and p38 MAPK was activated while miR-150-5p was weakly expressed in hypoxia-exposed HSFs. HIF-1alpha was enriched in the promoter region of miR-150-5p and downregulated its expression, thus repressing the ECM degradation of HSFs as shown by increased COL1A1 and TIMP-2 and reduced MMP2. In addition, LAMA4 was a downstream target of miR-150-5p and under the negative regulation by miR-150-5p. Overexpression of miR-150-5p promoted the ECM degradation of HSFs by inhibiting LAMA4 expression and p38 MAPK signaling pathway. However, upregulation of LAMA4 reversed the promoting effect of miR-150-5p on ECM degradation of HSFs. Overall, our findings suggest that HIF-1alpha can decline miR-150-5p expression and facilitate LAMA4-mediated p38 MAPK signaling pathway activation, thus arresting ECM degradation of HSFs and eventually inducing pathologic myopia.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the association between axial length (AL) and the prevalence of myopic maculopathy in a general Japanese population. Design(s): Population-based cross-sectional study. Participant(s): A total of 2790 Hisayama residents 40 years of age or older who consented to participate and had available data of AL and fundus photographs for the right eyes were enrolled in this study. Method(s): Myopic maculopathy was defined as the presence of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, or macular degeneration. The optimal cutoff values of axial length for identifying myopic maculopathy were estimated from the receiver operating characteristic curve. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a logistic regression analysis. Main Outcome Measure(s): Odds ratios of AL for prevalent myopic maculopathy and the optimal cutoff values of AL for detecting myopic maculopathy. Result(s): Longer AL was associated significantly with prevalence of myopic maculopathy in both genders. The optimal cutoff values of AL for identifying myopic maculopathy were 25.9 mm in men and 25.3 mm in women. Participants with ALs of these values or longer showed a significantly higher OR for myopic maculopathy than those with AL of less than these values (men: OR, 21.23; 95% CI, 8.74-51.57; women: OR, 38.49; 95% CI, 18.03-86.49). Conclusion(s): The present study found that there was a positive association between AL and the likelihood of myopic maculopathy, and the cutoff levels of AL for identifying myopic maculopathy were 25.9 mm in men and 25.3 mm in women. Our findings suggest that patients with AL close to or longer than these values should undergo intensive treatment and detailed ophthalmic follow-up.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the choroidal and photoreceptor thickness in highly myopic eyes and its correlation with visual acuity. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional, observational study involving 57 eyes of 57 highly myopic subjects [spherical equivalent >= -6 diopters (D) or axial length >= 26 mm] seen in a tertiary institutional center. Eyes with any clinical evidence of maculopathy or amblyopia were excluded. All subjects underwent a refraction assessment, visual acuity, axial length measurement using the IOL Master, and full ocular assessment. Eyes were imaged using Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography by one experienced operator. Two independent investigators manually measured subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and foveal photoreceptor thickness (FPT). Result(s): The mean SFCT was 195.88 +/- 87.63 mum (range: 32-373) and mean FPT was 96.68 +/- 11.23 mum (range: 67-100), after correction for ocular magnification. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in LogMAR was negatively correlated with SFCT (r = -0.510, p = 0.001) and FPT (r = -0.397, p = 0.002) and positively correlated with age (r = 0.418, p = 0.001) and axial length (r = 0.551, p = 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, axial length, and corrected FPT were significant risk factors for poorer BCVA (p = 0.021, < 0.001, and 0.02, respectively). Conclusion(s): FPT, age, and axial length are significant moderate predictive factors for poorer visual acuity in highly myopic eyes without myopic maculopathy. Thinner SFCT does not translate into poorer vision.Copyright © 2022 Mahmud, Ahem, Bastion, Omar, Nawi, Razak, Satali, Khialdin and Din.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the relationship between an oval optic disc and the occurrence of myopic foveoschisis (MF) using swept-source optic coherence tomography (SS-OCT). METHOD(S): Fifty eyes of 25 patients with unilateral MF were included in this retrospective observational study. The biometric features of the optic disc and peripapillary structures were evaluated using SS-OCT. RESULT(S): The ovality index (OI) of the optic disc was significantly smaller (P =0.003) and the optic disc tilt angle was greater (P =0.023) in the eyes with MF than in the contralateral eyes. The optic disc tilt angle was significantly correlated with the OI (P =0.000). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model (linear regression) demonstrated that spherical equivalent refraction (P =0.001), narrow macular staphyloma (P =0.001) and the occurrence of MF (P =0.026) were the independent factors associated with the OI. Narrow macular staphyloma was more frequent (P =0.020) and the staphyloma was deeper (P =0.006) in eyes with MF. GEE model (logistic regression) revealed that narrow macular staphyloma was the only independent factor related to the occurrence of MF (P =0.013). CONCLUSION(S): An oval optic disc in eyes with MF resulted from the increased tilt around the vertical disc axis. The optic disc tilt was related to narrow macular staphyloma, which was the only independent factor associated with the occurrence of MF. The clinical relevance needs further exploration through longitudinal analysis.Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

N2  - CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Myopia prevention and anti-myopia treatment is of great importance in South East Asia. BACKGROUND: To evaluate the prevalence and related factors of myopic retinopathy in Vietnam. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study was conducted on 168 eyes of 88 patients with high myopia presenting to the Refraction Department of Vietnam National Eye Hospital. Inclusion criteria were high myopia (<=-6.00D with cycloplegic retinoscopy). Consecutive presenting patients recruited between January 2020 and August 2020 consented to participate. RESULT(S): Participant age range was 12-47 years. Peripapillary atrophy was present in 70.2% of participants, most commonly atrophy of one-quarter of the disc (38.7%). Central retinal changes were present in 66.1% of participants, subclassified as tessellated fundus in 60.7%, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy in 4.2% and patchy chorioretinal atrophy in 1.2%. Peripheral retinal lesions were present in 43.5% of participants, consisting of white-without-pressure in 32.1%, lattice degeneration in 16.1%, snail track degeneration in 4.2% and microcystoid degeneration in 1.2%. Myopia <=-8.00D and axial length >=26.5 mm were associated with additional risk of posterior ocular complications. Furthermore, age >=19 years increased risk of central myopic retinopathy and >=10 years since initial myopia diagnosis increased the risk of peripapillary atrophy and central retinal changes. Other factors such as the age of onset of myopia and family myopia history did not appear to alter the risk of peripheral retina damage. CONCLUSION(S): Retinal disorders were common in Vietnamese people with high myopia. Within the current cohort with high myopia, myopia <=-8.00D and axial length >=26.5 mm were associated with a significant further elevation of risk.

N2  - Purpose To summarize the current understanding of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and to review the latest data regarding predictive factors of long-term morphological and visual outcomes in patients with mCNV treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs. Methods We conducted a literature review in September 2020 of all English-language articles in PubMed resulting from searches of the following MESH terms: 'choroidal neovascularization' AND 'myopia' OR 'Myopia, degenerative' OR 'myopic macular degeneration' OR 'myopic maculopathy' OR 'myopic retinopathy' OR 'pathological myopia' OR 'pathologic myopia'. The titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were independently scanned by 2 authors to gather information and determine whether they met inclusion criteria. After the preliminary search of the target database, we reached 431 articles. After reading the title and abstract, 62 articles were deemed as relevant for full publication review. After reading the full text, 18 articles were excluded (but we included an additional 29 studies after search of reference lists within the selected publications). To assess the risk of bias of each individual study we used the National Institutes of Health criteria. A questionnaire of four questions was applied according to the design of each study. If at least two of the four questions were positively answered, we concluded that the study was of adequate quality and included it in our review. The questionnaire was independently applied by 2 authors. This resulted in 73 articles being used to develop this review. Results Pathological myopia (PM) is one of the main causes of low vision worldwide. It is estimated around 3% of the world population suffers from PM. Of the affected individuals, 5-11% will develop mCNV. Furthermore, 35% of the patients with mCNV will develop bilateral disease in an 8-year period. Highly myopic patients experiencing a sudden loss of central vision should be referred for further examination. Once a diagnosis of myopic CNV has been confirmed, treatment initiation should be prompt and anti-VEGF agents should be considered as first-line therapy. Both intravitreal ranibizumab and intravitreal aflibercept have been approved for myopic CNV, but intravitreal bevacizumab has proven to be equally effective in non-randomized clinical trials and has been used off-label in clinical practice for a long time. Available long-term data for anti-VEGF agents are encouraging and significant gains in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) have been observed at up to seven years of follow-up with anti-VEGF therapy for mCNV. Conclusions Available long-term data for anti-VEGF agents are encouraging and significant long-term gains in BCVA have been recently demonstrated. Notwithstanding, many patients experience stabilization or a decrease in their BCVA over time due to development or progression of perilesional chorioretinal atrophy (CRA). In fact, anti-VEGF treatment does not prevent development of new or enlarged areas of CRA around the regressed CNV lesion (perilesional CRA). Future studies are required to identify therapies that prevent perilesional CRA development/progression.

N2  - Purpose To investigate the anatomical and functional outcomes of indirect ophthalmoscopy versus chandelier illumination in scleral buckling surgery due to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Methods A retrospective observational includes 50 RRD patients who underwent scleral buckling surgery. Conventional surgery with indirect ophthalmoscopy was performed for 30 patients (Group 1) and retinal examination under chandelier illumination was performed for 20 patients (Group 2) during the conventional surgery. The anatomical and functional outcomes of the two groups were compared. Results The demographic characteristics of the groups were similar (p >0.050). The preoperative clinical characteristics of the groups including preoperative time, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, presence of associated risk factors (complicated cataract surgery, trauma, pathological myopia), extensity of attached retina, presence of macular involvement, and retinal tear number and localization, were also similar (p>0.05). There was no difference between the groups in terms of postoperative visual acuity, intraocular pressure, the rate of re-operation, and the time of re-operation (p >0.05). On the other hand, a total of post-operative complications including epiretinal membrane, glaucoma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, foveal atrophy, gaze restriction, cystoid macular edema, and macular hole occurred more common in Group 1 (p =0.001) Conclusions Despite postoperative visual acuity is similar, using chandelier illumination in addition to conventional scleral buckling surgery techniques has lowering effects on the postoperative complication rate.

N2  - Purpose To evaluate the sensitivity of a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) biomarker, the choroidal shadowing, in active myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). This finding is typically caused by the tissue density of the neovascular complex that leads to the tomographic hypotransmission from the retina toward the choroid. Methods The clinical and imaging parameters of eyes with high myopia (spherical equivalent of-6D or less) with naive or recurrent mCNV were reviewed independently by two investigators. A control group with inactive mCNV was included, too. The presence of mCNV was based on multimodal imaging that included fluorescein angiography and SD-OCT findings. When available, OCT angiography was also used. Presence of choroidal hypo-transmission was defined as the shadowing of the retinal lesion projected toward the underlying choroid on SD-OCT. The shadowing enables distinguishment of the adjacent, unaffected choroid from the underneath choroid masked by the lesion Results Eighty-three eyes (27 men, 56 women) with active mCNV were included in the study. The mean patient age was 67,69 years (range, 39-89 years) with a mean of-10.02 diopters (range-6,-24). In the control group 30 eyes (10 men, 20 women) with fibrotic mCNV were included. The mean patient age was 65,06 years (range 44-89) with a mean of-11,7 (range-6,-20). Fifty-two eyes with active mCNV presented choroidal shadowing in correspondence of the lesion resulting in a sensitivity of 63%. Twelve eyes with fibrotic mCNV presented choroidal shadowing too, thus resulting in a specificity of 60%. The concordance between the investigators was good (Cohen's k factor = 0.80). Conclusions In active mCNV, choroidal shadowing is a tomographic biomarker with a limited positive and negative predictive value.

N2  - Purpose Achromatopsia (ACHM) is a rare inherited retinal disease, characterized by serious cone dysfunction, affecting approximately one in every 30,000 live births worldwide. Over 150 mutations in CNGA3 and CNGB3 genes have been identified as pathologic, accounting for approximately 70-80% of all cases of ACHM. The diagnosis is based upon clinical findings as reduced central visual acuity on early childhood, pathologic myopia, pendular nystagmus, photophobia, eccentric fixation with central scotomas and reduced or complete lack of colour vision (CV), suggested by signs of central macular atrophy on funduscopic examination, disruption of external segments of foveal photoreceptors on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), abnormal Colour Vision Testing (CVT), abnormal Visual Fields (VF) and abolished cone function on Eletrorretinography (ERG) and confirmed by genetic testing. The nature and early onset of sight impairment can be severely disabling, with significant impact on activities of daily living. We propose to describe 4 families with ACHM from our database, in order to raise awareness about this entity among Ophthalmologists. Methods Research of ACHM cases from our Ocular Genetics database brought out 4 cases of different families that we decided to include in this report: Case 1: 29 years old female Case 2: 46 years old male Case 3: 9 years old male Case 4: 15 years old male Results Case 1: Complaints of myopia, photophobia, nystagmus and colour vision deficiency (CVD) since childhood. Her parents shared consanguinity. Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was 20 / 160 on both eyes (OU). Funduscopy showed orange-stained macula. VF revealed central escotomata and ERG photopic cone response was extinct. Genetic testing disclosed homozygous mutation in CNGB3. Case 2: Complaints of myopia, photophobia, nystagmus and CVD since 2. BCVA was 20 / 160 Right Eye (RE) and 20/200 Left Eye (LE). Funduscopy showed altered bilateral foveal reflex Funduscopy showed altered bilateral foveal reflex. VF revealed tunnel vision and ERG showed abolished photopic cone responses and diminished scotopic response. Genetic testing disclosed compound heterozygous mutation in CNGA3. Case 3: Complaints of myopia, photophobia, congenital nystagmus and severe CVD since 2. BCVA was 10/200 OU. Funduscopy showed altered bilateral foveal reflex. Genetic testing disclosed homozygous mutation in CNGB3. Case 4: Pakistanis, with myopia, photophobia, nystagmus and color blindness since birth. His parents are first cousins and his brother has similar vision problems. BCVA was 20 /160 RE and 20/200 LE. Funduscopy showed orange-stained macula and ERG showed abolished photopic cone responses and diminished scotopic response. Genetic testing disclosed homozygous mutation in CNGB3. Conclusions ACHM is a rare disease that progressively leads to serious loss of cones and consequently vision deficiency. It is inherited as an autossomic recessive pattern. A complete vision checkup is mandatory, including complementary exams as OCT, ERG, FAF, VF and CVT. Genetic counselling is recommended after genotyping. Novel mutations and pathologic variants are being constantly discovered, giving place for scientists and geneticists to develop innovative therapeutic genetic strategies.

N2  - Purpose Myopic choroidal neovascularisation (mCNV) is a common vision threatening complication of myopia, reported to affect 5-11% of individuals with pathologic myopia. Long-term outcomes and the risk of reactivation of mCNV are unclear and especially poorly described in a predominantly Caucasian population. The aim of this study is to describe long-term visual acuity (VA) outcomes in a large cohort of eyes treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections for mCNV; describe the number of treatments over time; and analyse reactivation episodes in a large cohort of eyes with mCNV, to understand the pattern of injections within and between each episode. Methods The electronic health records (Medisoft EMR) of patients receiving anti-VEGF treatment for mCNV were analysed. The end of one mCNV reactivation episode was derived from the distribution of plotting the interval between the injection episodes and was found to be 90 days. As such, any successive injections would have to be less than 90 days between each other to be considered in one episode. Main outcome measures included visual acuity and number of injections. Results Overall, 822 eyes of 732 patients were included in the study. Of all patients, 503 (68.7%) were female. In the first year of treatment, VA improved from around 0.50 logMAR to around 0.43 logMAR, but then steadily declined to around 0.78 logMAR at approximately nine years from baseline. It dropped below baseline after three years on average. The median time for 15 letter loss was 4.5 years. At 3.5 years, 62% of eyes gained 15 letters of vision. The number of injections across reactivation episodes decreased, starting at 2.9 average injections per episode for the first reactivation episode, decreasing to an average of 1.7 injections per episode by the fifth episode. The average number of injections per year also decreased over time, from a mean of 2.21 injections in the first year to 0.54 in year 5 and 0.01 in year 6. Conclusions Our data shows a long-term decline in visual acuity in patients with mCNV. The mean number of episodes and the mean number of treatments decreased over the years, suggesting that neovascularisation may not be the main cause of visual loss over time in these patients. Further investigation of the determinants of long-term visual loss in this predominantly Caucasian cohort is warranted as to whether this is driven by progressive atrophy or suboptimal treatment.

N2  - Purpose This study had three aims: 1) determine AL cut-off values to distinguish between pathologic myopia (PM) and severe PM; and 2) identify clinical differences between PM and severe PM according to ATN grading system. Methods Cross-sectional, non-interventional study. A series of 656 eyes from 352 highly myopic patients were included. All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination, ATN grading and multimodal imaging. Results The eyes were graded on the ATN system and classified as PM (>=A2) or severe PM (>=A3, >=T3, and/or N2). Significant between-group (PM vs. severe PM) differences (p<0.05) were observed on the individual ATN components (atrophic [A], tractional [T] and neovascular [N]). Patients classified with severe PM were older, had longer AL, and worse BCVA (p<0.05). ROC curve analysis showed the optimal AL cut-off value to distinguish between PM and severe PM at 28 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.813, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 75%) and 29.50 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.760, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 70%), respectively. Conclusions The optimal cut-off points for axial length to detect PM and severe PM are 28 mm and 29.5 mm, respectively. These AL cut-off values would help to establish myopic conditions numerically by relying on the clinical features defined previously; and should be taken into account for closer follow-up, ophthalmic management and treatment.

N2  - Purpose To report the 24-month outcomes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in predominantly Caucasian eyes in routine clinical practice. Methods Retrospective analysis of treatment-naive eyes starting intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors of either bevacizumab (1.25mg) or ranibizumab (0.5mg) for mCNV from 1st January 2006 to 31st May 2018 that were tracked in the Fight Retinal Blindness! registry. Results We identified 203 eyes (bevacizumab - 85 and ranibizumab - 118) of 189 patients. The estimated mean (95%CI) change in VA over 24 months for all eyes using longitudinal models was +8 (5, 11) letters with a median (Q1, Q3) of 3 (2, 5) injections given mostly during the first year. The estimated mean change in VA at 24 months was similar between bevacizumab and ranibizumab (+9 [5, 13] letters for bevacizumab vs +9 [6, 13] letters for ranibizumab; P = 0.37). Both agents were also similar in the mCNV activity outcomes, treatment frequency and visit frequency. Conclusions The 24-month treatment outcomes of VEGF inhibitors for mCNV were favorable in this largest series yet reported of predominantly Caucasian eyes in routine clinical practice, with approximately 2 lines of visual gain and a median of 3 injections given mostly during the first year. These outcomes are similar to those reported for predominantly Asian eyes. Bevacizumab appeared to be as safe and effective as ranibizumab.

N2  - Purpose Purpose: to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in 12 to 60 months follow-up or longer in real clinical practice. Methods Methods. A retrospective single-center study was carried out. It included an analysis of the medical data of patients with mCNV treated with intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (0.5 mg) and / or aflibercept (2.0 mg) in 1+ PRN regimen. Inclusion criteria: mCNV with signs of exudative activity confirmed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and / or fundus fluorescence angiography; the length of the axis of the eyeball is more than 25mm. Exclusion criteria: follow-up less than 12 months; gross violations by the patient of the treatment regimen (low level of compliance, expressed in the refusal to continue monitoring or therapy) during the first year of the study. The study group consisted of 45 patients (49 eyes), incl. 8 (17.8%) men and 37 (82.2%) women aged 25 to 79 years (median (Me)-53; 25% and 75% quartile (Q25; Q75) [44; 62] years). The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 to 107 months (median-56 [26; 75]). Statistical processing was carried out using the statistical software package Statistica 13.5.0. To assess the significance of differences in the studied samples, a simple nonparametric Wilcoxon test for dependent samples was used. Statistical hypotheses were considered confirmed at a significance level of p <0.05. Results Results. To analyze the results of treatment, subgroups of patients were identified who were under observation for at least 12 (n = 49), 24 (n = 40) and 36 (n = 30) months, as well as more than 5 years (n = 16). In all studied subgroups, there was a statistically significant (p <0.05) improvement in the functional (increase in BCVA) and anatomical (decrease in CRT) parameters in the first year of treatment, which remained throughout the observation period. The average BCVA value in the study group increased during the observation period by 0.23 (from the initial 0.27 to the final 0.5). In the course of observation, the parameters of CRT decreased by an average of 88.1 microns (from the initial 333.7 to the final 245.6). Relapses of mCNV activity occurred in 30 (61.2%) cases. The resumption of anti-VEGF therapy in the second year of follow-up was required in 32.5% of cases (13 out of 40 patients), in the third-in 36.7% (11/30), in the fourth-in 24.0% (6/25), in the fifth-in 33.3% (7/21), in the sixth-in 37.5% (6/16), in the seventh-in 28.6% (2/7). Conclusions Conclusion. A retrospective assessment of the initial status of the eyes included in the study was carried out, taking into account the presence of atrophic, traction and neovascular components and their severity according to ophthalmoscopy and OCT diagnostics in accordance with the modern ATN classification (Ruiz-Medrano J. et al., 2019). The atrophic component (A) was most often represented by diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (A2)-34 cases (69.4%). The most common variant of the traction component (T) was the absence of macular schisis (T0), detected in 39 eyes (79.6%). The neovascular component (N), along with active mCNV (N2), which was the criterion for inclusion in the study, was represented by lacquer cracks (N1), identified in 4 cases (8.2%). The high efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy of mCNV with ranibizumab and aflibercept was confirmed in real clinical practice, which was expressed in a statistically significant (p <0.05) increase in BCVA and a decrease in CRT during treatment. The dynamics of parameters, achieved in the first year of treatment, persisted within 36 months (n = 30) and more than 5 years (61-107 months, n = 16). In several cases, unrelated progression of concomitant mCNV traction and atrophic conditions, as well as cataracts, was recorded.

N2  - Background: The objective is to examine the clinical characteristics of three patients with macular hole that occurred in inferior posterior staphyloma associated with tilted disc syndrome. Case presentations: This study involved three eyes of three Japanese female patients (mean age 76.0 years, range 73-84 years) with macular hole occurring in inferior posterior staphyloma associated with tilted disc syndrome. One of the three eyes was slightly myopic, while the other two eyes were highly myopic. In all three eyes, the macular hole was found to be located in or near the margin of the inferior posterior staphyloma. In one eye, the extent of retinoschisis was rather broad in the margin of the macular hole, and another eye had a history of treatment for choroidal neovascularization. As surgical treatment, the internal limiting membrane in areas surrounding the macular hole was detached after producing artificial posterior vitreous detachment, and a gas tamponade was performed. It was found during surgery that the extensibility of the retina in the margin of the MH was decreased in the three eyes as compared with a usual macular hole. Although the macular hole was successfully closed in all three cases post surgery, the layer structure of the central retina was poorly repaired in all three cases and choroidal neovascularization remained in one case. In all three cases, corrected visual acuity remained at 0.3-0.5 post surgery. Conclusion(s): Our findings showed poor improvement of visual acuity in all three cases post surgery, even if closure of the macular hole is achieved, thus suggesting that in cases of macular hole associated with tilted disc syndrome and inferior posterior staphyloma, the presence of macular dysfunction existing prior to the onset of macular hole affects visual prognosis.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - Background: Pathologic myopia (PM) associated with myopic maculopathy (MM) and "Plus" lesions is a major cause of irreversible visual impairment worldwide. Therefore, we aimed to develop a series of deep learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI)-models for automatic PM identification, MM classification, and "Plus" lesion detection based on retinal fundus images. Material(s) and Method(s): Consecutive 37,659 retinal fundus images from 32,419 patients were collected. After excluding 5,649 ungradable images, a total dataset of 32,010 color retinal fundus images was manually graded for training and cross-validation according to the META-PM classification. We also retrospectively recruited 1,000 images from 732 patients from the three other hospitals in Zhejiang Province, serving as the external validation dataset. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and quadratic-weighted kappa score were calculated to evaluate the classification algorithms. The precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to evaluate the object detection algorithms. The performance of all the algorithms was compared with the experts' performance. To better understand the algorithms and clarify the direction of optimization, misclassification and visualization heatmap analyses were performed. Result(s): In five-fold cross-validation, algorithm I achieved robust performance, with accuracy = 97.36% (95% CI: 0.9697, 0.9775), AUC = 0.995 (95% CI: 0.9933, 0.9967), sensitivity = 93.92% (95% CI: 0.9333, 0.9451), and specificity = 98.19% (95% CI: 0.9787, 0.9852). The macro-AUC, accuracy, and quadratic-weighted kappa were 0.979, 96.74% (95% CI: 0.963, 0.9718), and 0.988 (95% CI: 0.986, 0.990) for algorithm II. Algorithm III achieved an accuracy of 0.9703 to 0.9941 for classifying the "Plus" lesions and an F1-score of 0.6855 to 0.8890 for detecting and localizing lesions. The performance metrics in external validation dataset were comparable to those of the experts and were slightly inferior to those of cross-validation. Conclusion(s): Our algorithms and AI-models were confirmed to achieve robust performance in real-world conditions. The application of our algorithms and AI-models has promise for facilitating clinical diagnosis and healthcare screening for PM on a large scale.© Copyright © 2021 Lu, Ren, Tang, Yang, Yuan, Yu, Huang, Zhou, Lu, He, Zhu, Ke and Han.

N2  - Purpose: This study had two aims: 1) determine AL cut-off values to distinguish between pathologic myopia (PM) and severe PM; and 2) identify clinical differences between PM and severe PM according to ATN grading system. Method(s): Cross-sectional, non-interventional study. A series of 656 eyes from 352 highly myopic patients were included. All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination, ATN grading and multimodal imaging. Result(s): The eyes were graded on the ATN system and classified as PM (>=A2) or severe PM (>=A3, >=T3, and/or N2). Significant between-group (PM vs. severe PM) differences (p<0.05) were observed on the individual ATN components (atrophic [A], tractional [T] and neovascular [N]). Patients classified with severe PM were older, had longer AL, and worse BCVA (p<0.05). ROC curve analysis showed the optimal AL cut-off value to distinguish between PM and severe PM at 28 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.813, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 75%) and 29.50 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.760, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 70%), respectively. Conclusion(s): The optimal cut-off points for axial length to detect PM and severe PM are 28 mm and 29.5 mm, respectively. These AL cut-off values would help to establish myopic conditions numerically by relying on the clinical features defined previously; and should be taken into account for closer follow-up, ophthalmic management and treatment.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the reliability of the ATN classification in patients with pathologic myopia (PM) and its correlation with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Method(s): 100 highly myopic eyes with spherical equivalent (SE) > -6.0 D or axial length (AL) >26 mm and a total ATN score >=3 underwent a complete ophthalmological examination, including fundus photography and swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Five observers graded each eye using the ATN system. Mean1 T, and N scores were calculated and correlated with age, BCVA (LogMAR), and AL. Patients were considered to present severe PM if either A or T components were >=3 and/or N was >=2. Result(s): 100 eyes (53 left) from 91 patients (78 females) were classified. Mean age, BCVA, and AL values were, respectively, 65.1+/-11.7 years (range, 36 to 97), -0.63+/-0.62 (-3.00 to 0.00), and 29.26+/-2.7 mm (26.01 to 37.66). Mean ATN grades for each component were: A=2.51+/-0.78 (0.6 to 4.0), T= 0.88+/-1.14 (0.0 to 5.0), and N=1.31+/-1.40 (0.0 to 3.0). Weighted interobserver agreement was 98.1%, 98.7%, and 94.6%, for1 T and N respectively. In eyes with severe PM, BCVA was significantly lower and AL significantly longer. Conclusion(s): The excellent interobserver rate in this study demonstrates that the updated ATN grading system is an accurate and reliable tool to classify patients with PM. These findings show that BCVA is more compromised in eyes with severe PM, particularly those graded >= A3 and/or T3.

T1  - An Update of Eye Shape and Myopia

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Myopia is one of the most prevalent eye diseases, and its advanced form, high myopia, is a leading cause of subsequent pathologic myopia, which in turn results in an increased risk of retinal diseases. The prevalence of myopia and high myopia is 28.3% and 4.0% of the global population, respectively, and these numbers are estimated to increase to 49.8% for myopia 9.8% for high myopia by 2050, thus making myopia a severe global socioeconomic problem. The eye shape has been receiving increasing attention as a possible biomarker for myopia. Among several modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently considered to be the best to measure the 3-dimensional eye shape, and one study using MRI revealed that myopic eyes became much larger in all 3 dimensions, but more so in length (0.35 mm/D) than in height (0.19 mm/D) or in width (0.10 mm/D), which fitted in global and axial elongation models. Another recent study reported that emmetropic retinas were oblate but oblateness decreased with myopia progression. According to a study to evaluate eye shapes in high myopia, although all emmetropic eyes had a blunt shape, almost half of the high myopic eyes had a pointed shape. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that abnormal eye shape changes can cause not only simple myopia but also various ocular complications through biomechanical stretching. In this review, we highlight recent findings on eye shape changes in myopic eyes and abnormal eye shapes in pathologic myopia. Copyright © 2018 Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists, Inc.

N2  - Purpose of Study To report on P3H2 variants causing non-syndromic high degenerative myopia guiding precision medical care. Methods Used Chart review, Next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel, and exome trio genetic testing. Summary of Results A 3-year-old male with bilateral degenerative high myopia (-12.75 diopter spherical (DS)) and refractive amblyopia diagnosed at 2 years of age, was referred to genomic medicine. He was born full-term with an unremarkable prenatal and birth history. His developmental milestones were normal other than mild articulation difficulty. Family history was significant for myopia of -3.00 DS. Physical exam was normal other than midfacial hypoplasia and depressed nasal bridge. Testing in the connective tissue panel, including Stickler syndrome genes and FBN1 for Marfan's syndrome, was negative. Several rare non-syndromic myopia genes have been reported; however, given the lack of NGS panel, an exome trio was ordered. This identified two pathogenic variants in the P3H2 gene, c.1372 C>T, p.Q458* and c.1328del, p.G443Vfs* in trans, confirmed by parental testing. P3H2, also called LEPREL1, encodes the Prolyl 3-hydroxylase- 2 enzyme, which performs the 3-hydroxylation of proline residues in collagens. Tissues from the eye, including the sclera, cornea (type 1), and lens capsule (type 4), are composed of collagen. The abnormal collagen molecule processing may cause weakened collagen in eye tissues. Mutations in the P3H2 gene have been associated with non-syndromic earlyonset severe myopia with cataracts, lens instability, vitreoretinal degeneration, and risk of retinal detachment mostly in consanguineous families as homozygous variants. There are no reported skeletal issues or syndromic features. The variants in our proband have not been published in the past, but they have been reported once in ClinVar with different variants considered pathogenic. Conclusions The degenerative high myopia in our proband is due to pathogenic heterozygous variants in the P3H2 gene, consistent with non-syndromic severe myopia and refractive amblyopia. This molecular diagnosis guides management of potential ocular risks and prevents unnecessary systemic evaluation, such as echocardiograms. It will influence the patient's future lifestyle choices, such as avoiding contact sports and choosing suitable careers. It also eased parental anxiety and offered more accurate inheritance and recurrence risk counseling for parents and extended family.

N2  - BACKGROUND Myopic foveoschisis (MF) is a common complication of pathological myopia. A macular hole (MH) usually results from the natural progression of MF and is a common complication of vitrectomy. Vitrectomy combined with residual internal limiting membrane (ILM) covering and autologous blood was effective for closing a secondary MH. CASE SUMMARY A 52-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a complaint of blurred vision in the right eye for 7 years. Her best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/100, axial length was 25.79 mm and standard equivalent refractive error was -10.5 dioptres. Preoperative optical coherence tomography revealed foveoschisis in the right eye. Vitrectomy with fovea-sparing ILM peeling was performed. An MH developed and gradually expanded 5 mo after the initial vitrectomy. Vitrectomy with residual ILM covering and autologous blood was performed. The MH closed 3 wk after the second vitrectomy. CONCLUSION Fovea-sparing ILM peeling can provide residual ILM for the treatment of MH secondary to vitrectomy for MF. Vitrectomy combined with residual ILM covering and autologous blood is effective for closing secondary MH and improving BCVA.Copyright © 2022

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate morphologic features along posterior staphyloma edges in eyes with pathologic myopia using ultra-widefield optical coherence tomography imaging. METHOD(S): Highly myopic patients (refractive error < -8 diopters or axial length >=26.5 mm) were consecutively examined by prototype ultra-widefield optical coherence tomography with a scan width of 23 mm and depth of 5 mm. Staphyloma edges were assessed for scleral, choroidal, and retinal status, as well as measurements of angle size. Findings were correlated with pigmentary changes observed on Optos fundus photography, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULT(S): In 164 eyes diagnosed with posterior staphyloma by ultra-widefield optical coherence tomography, choroidal thinning and scleral protrusion were hallmark features of staphyloma edges, observed simultaneously in more than 95% of staphylomatous eyes. Outer neural retinal thinning was observed in 80 eyes (48.8%), whereas 15 eyes (9.1%) showed retinal pigment epithelium damage. The mean angle at the staphyloma edge was 23degree +/- 12.4degree (range 8degree to 77degree). Larger angles were significant predictors of retinal thinning (adjusted odds ratio: 1.17, confidence interval: 1.09-1.25), and the staphyloma was detected by Optos pseudocolor fundus photography (adjusted odds ratio: 1.08, confidence interval: 1.02-1.15). CONCLUSION(S): These morphologic findings may provide a basis for exploring the natural evolution of posterior staphyloma as part of the development of pathologic myopia.

N2  - Purpose: To reveal clinical features of patchy atrophy in pathologic myopia and investigate the status of the Bruch membrane and retinal pigment epithelium by swept-source optical coherence tomography. Method(s): This study reviewed highly myopic patients who visited the high myopia clinic between January 2015 and February 2018. Wide-field photographs and wide-field fundus autofluorescence fundus images were used as the primary method for identifying PAs, and swept-source optical coherence tomography images were used for investigating the retinochoroid status of PAs. Result(s): Four hundred fifty-six PAs were detected in 137 eyes (118 patients). Patchy atrophys were located most often in the macular area (28.3%), followed by the inferior (25.9%), temporal (18.9%), nasal (14.5%), and superior (12.5%) region. All 210, PAs which had been fully or partially scanned by swept-source optical coherence tomography, showed a retinal pigment epithelium defect, and 174 (82.9%) PAs showed a Bruch membrane defect on the available scans. In 101 (82.8%) of 122 PAs with clearly detectable borders of the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch membrane defect, the Bruch membrane defects were smaller than the retinal pigment epithelium defects. A dome-shape inward bulging of the sclera was observed in 10 PAs. Conclusion(s): These morphological findings may provide a basis for exploring the biomechanical etiology of the PAs as part of the development of pathologic myopia.Copyright © by Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.

N2  - Refractive errors are associated with a range of pathological conditions such as myopic maculopathy and glaucoma and are highly heritable. Studies of missense and putative loss-of-function (pLOF) variants identified via whole exome sequencing (WES) offer the prospect of directly implicating potentially causative disease genes. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for refractive error in 51624 unrelated adults of European ancestry aged 40-69 years from the United Kingdom genotyped using WES. After testing 29179 pLOF and 495263 missense variants, 1 pLOF and 18 missense variants in 14 distinct genomic regions were taken forward for fine-mapping analysis. This yielded 19 putative causal variants, of which 18 had a posterior inclusion probability >0.5. Of the 19 putative causal variants, 12 were novel discoveries. Specific variants were associated with a more myopic refractive error while others were associated with a more hyperopic refractive error. Association with age-of-onset of spectacle wear (AOSW) was examined in an independent validation sample (38100 early-AOSW cases and 74243 controls). Of 11 novel variants that could be tested, 8 (73%) showed evidence of association with AOSW status. This work identified COL4A4 and ATM as novel candidate genes associated with refractive error. In addition, novel putative causal variants were identified in the genes RASGEF1, ARMS2, BMP4, SIX6, GSDMA, GNGT2, ZNF652 and CRX. Despite these successes, the study also highlighted the limitations of community-based WES studies compared to high myopia case-control WES studies.Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - Importance: Pathologic myopia due to an excessive increase of axial length is associated with severe visual impairments. Systematic analyses to determine the rate of and the risk factors associated with the axial elongation in adults with high myopia based on long-term follow-up of a large population are needed. Objective(s): To determine the risk factors associated with axial elongation in adults with high myopia. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This cohort study used the medical records of 43 201 patient visits in a single-hospital database that were collected from January 3, 2011, to December 28, 2018. A total of 15 745 medical records with the patients' sex, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), axial length, type of myopic maculopathy, and the presence or absence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) were reviewed. Data were analyzed from April 3, 2019, to August 5, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Changes in the axial length at each examination were calculated. The significance of the associations between the annual increase of the axial length and age, sex, baseline axial length, types of myopic maculopathy, and a history of CNV was determined. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the strength of the risk factors associated with an increase of the axial length in high myopia. Result(s): Among 1877 patients with 9161 visits included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 62.10 (12.92) years, and 1357 (72.30%) were women. The mean (SD) axial length was 29.66 (2.20) mm with a mean (SD) growth rate of 0.05 (0.24) mm/y. Among the 9161 visits, 7096 eyes (77.46%) had myopic maculopathy and 2477 eyes (27.04%) had CNV. The odds ratio for inducing a severe elongation of the axial length was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.38-1.55) for female sex, 0.44 (95% CI, 0.35-0.56) to 0.63 (95% CI, 13 0.50-0.78) for older than 40 years, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.15-1.54) for BCVA of less than 20/400, 1.67 (95% CI, 1.54-1.81) to 2.67 (95% CI, 2.46-2.88) for baseline axial length of 28.15 mm or greater, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.96-1.17) to 1.39 (95% CI, 1.24-1.55) for the presence of maculopathy, and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.29-1.47) for prior CNV. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found continuing axial elongation in adults with high myopia. The risk factors for elongation do not appear to be modifiable, so prevention of myopia may be the best approach to reduce the incidence of pathologic myopia and its complications in the future..Copyright © 2021 American Medical Association.

N2  - Purpose: This study had three aims: (1) correlate axial length (AL), age and best-corrected visual acuity in high myopic patients scored on the ATN grading system; (2) determine AL cut-off values to distinguish between pathologic myopia (PM) and severe PM; and (3) identify clinical differences between PM and severe PM. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional, non-interventional study. All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination, ATN grading and multimodal imaging (colour fundus photography, swept-source OCT, fundus autofluorescence, OCT angiography and fluorescein angiography). Result(s): Six hundred forty-four eyes from 345 high myopic patients were included. The eyes were graded on the ATN system and classified as PM (>= A2) or severe PM (>= A3, >= T3 and/or N2). Significant between-group (PM vs. severe PM) differences (p < 0.05) were observed on the individual ATN components (atrophic [A], tractional [T] and neovascular [N]), age, BCVA and AL. AL was also linearly correlated with the A, T and N components (r = 0.53, p < 0.01; r = 0.24, p < 0.01; r = 0.20, p < 0.01; respectively). ROC curve analysis showed the optimal AL cut-off value to distinguish between PM at 28 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.813, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 75%) and severe PM at 29.50 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.760, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 70%). Conclusion(s): AL is the main variable associated with myopic maculopathy. Due to the clinical differences found between PM and severe PM, there is need to create an objective cut-off point to distinguish these two different entities being the optimal cut-off points for AL 28 mm and 29.5 mm, respectively. These objective AL cut-off values should be taken into account for determining a correct follow-up, ophthalmic management and treatment.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the association between different types of posterior staphyloma (PS) and refractive error (RE) after cataract surgery in patients with high myopia. Method(s): This retrospective study included 113 eyes of 113 highly myopic patients with PS. PS was detected using a wide-field fundus imaging system. PS was classified into wide macular, narrow macular, and other types. RE equaled the actual spherical equivalent (SE) minus the targeted SE values 3 months after cataract surgery. Result(s): The rates of wide macular, narrow macular, and other types of PS were 46.02, 39.82, and 14.16%, respectively. There were no significant differences in best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) or SE among the three classifications of PS before cataract surgery (P > 0.05). However, postoperative BCDVA and SE were significantly different among the three types of PS patients (P < 0.05). The average RE values were 0.98 +/- 1.00 D, 0.19 +/- 0.87 D, 0.13 +/- 0.59 D, respectively; the statistical differences of RE were <0.01, <0.01, and 0.81 (wide macular vs. narrow macular, wide macular vs. other types, narrow macular vs. other types), respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that higher hyperopia RE after surgery was associated with wide macular staphyloma (P < 0.001), more myopic SE (P = 0.003), and increased BCDVA (P = 0.002) before surgery. Conclusion(s): Wide macular PS may be associated with more hyperopic RE; it may serve as a critical biomarker of hyperopic RE after cataract surgery in highly myopic patients.Copyright © 2021 Wu, Wang, Liu, Zhou, Jiang and Liu.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of multispectral imaging (MSI), a noninvasive imaging technique composed of a series of monochromatic scanning light, for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). METHOD(S): This was a prospective observational study. Polypoidal lesions on MSI are defined by oval or lobular hyperreflective oval lesion with dark hyporeflective center. Branching vascular networks on MSI is featured by hyperreflective interlacing signal. Detection sensitivity and specificity of polypoidal lesions was compared with indocyanine green angiography, whereas sensitivity and specificity of branching vascular networks, subretinal fluid, and pigment epithelium detachment were compared with optical coherence tomography. RESULT(S): Among 67 eyes, 38 eyes (56.7%) were diagnosed with PCV, 7 eyes (10.4%) with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, 13 eyes (19.4%) with central serous chorioretinopathy, 6 eyes (9.0%) with pathological myopia, and 3 eyes (4.5%) with idiopathic choroidal neovascularization. Compared with indocyanine green angiography, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing PCV by MSI alone was 84.21% and 93.10%, respectively, and the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value for PCV by MSI was 94.12% and 81.82%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting polypoidal lesions were 84.21% and 93.10% compared with indocyanine green angiography. Compared with optical coherence tomography, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting branching vascular networks were 95.83% and 88.37%, for the subretinal fluid were 76.92% and 86.67%, and for the pigment epithelium detachment were 91.11% and 90.91%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Multispectral imaging allowed noninvasive visualization of polypoidal lesions and branching vascular networks and may serve as a new diagnostic option for PCV.

N2  - Purpose: To report the 24-month outcomes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in predominantly Caucasian eyes in routine clinical practice. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of treatment-naive eyes starting intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors of either bevacizumab (1.25 mg) or ranibizumab (0.5 mg) for mCNV from 1 January 2006 to 31 May 2018 that were tracked in the Fight Retinal Blindness! registry. Result(s): We identified 203 eyes (bevacizumab-85 and ranibizumab-118) of 189 patients. The estimated mean (95% CI) change in VA over 24 months for all eyes using longitudinal models was +8 (5, 11) letters with a median (Q1, Q3) of 3 (2, 5) injections given mostly during the first year. The estimated mean change in VA at 24 months was similar between bevacizumab and ranibizumab [+9 (5, 13) letters for bevacizumab versus +9 (6, 13) letters for ranibizumab; p = 0.37]. Both agents were also similar in the mCNV activity outcomes, treatment frequency and visit frequency. Conclusion(s): The 24-month treatment outcomes of VEGF inhibitors for mCNV were favourable in this largest series yet reported of predominantly Caucasian eyes in routine clinical practice, with approximately two lines of visual gain and a median of three injections given mostly during the first year. These outcomes are similar to those reported for predominantly Asian eyes. Bevacizumab appeared to be as safe and effective as ranibizumab.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Changes in and around anatomical structures such as blood vessels, optic disc, fovea, and macula can lead to ophthalmological diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, agerelated macular degeneration (AMD), myopia, hypertension, and cataracts. If these diseases are not diagnosed early, they may cause partial or complete loss of vision in patients. Fundus imaging is the primary method used to diagnose ophthalmologic diseases. In this study, a powerful R-CNN+LSTMbased approach is proposed that automatically detects eight different ophthalmologic diseases from fundus images. Deep features were extracted from fundus images with the proposed R-CNN+LSTM structure. Among the deep features extracted, those with high representative power were selected with an approach called NCAR, which is a multilevel feature selection algorithm. In the classification phase, the SVM algorithm, which is a powerful classifier, was used. The proposed approach is evaluated on the eight-class ODIR dataset. The accuracy (main metric), sensitivity, specificity, and precision metrics were used for the performance evaluation of the proposed approach. Besides, the performance of the proposed approach was compared with the existing approaches using the ODIR dataset.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - Globally, cases of myopia have reached epidemic levels. High myopia and pathological myopia (PM) are the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in China, demanding a large volume of myopia screening tasks to control the rapid growing myopic prevalence. It is desirable to develop the automatically intelligent system to facilitate these time- and labor- consuming tasks. In this study, we designed a series of deep learning systems to detect PM and myopic macular lesions according to a recent international photographic classification system (META-PM) classification based on color fundus images. Notably, our systems recorded robust performance both in the test and external validation dataset. The performance was comparable to the general ophthalmologist and retinal specialist. With the extensive adoption of this technology, effective mass screening for myopic population will become feasible on a national scale.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: To study perforating scleral vessels (PSVs) in patients with high myopia using swept-source optical coherence tomography and to determine their relationship with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and its activity. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of patients with high myopia ($26 D or $26 mm of axial length) using multimodal imaging. The presence of PSVs and mCNV was assessed using swept-source optical coherence tomography images (TRITON; Topcon Corporation, Japan). Result(s): Five hundred sixty-four eyes from 297 highly myopic patients were studied. One hundred fifty-five eyes (27.5%) showed signs of mCNV while PSVs were found in 500 eyes (88.6%). Perforating scleral vessels were found in 93.5% (145/155) of eyes with mCNV, and they were under or in contact with the mCNV in 80.6% (117/145). The mean number of intravitreal injections received by patients with mCNV was 4.06 +/- 4.17 along 66.9 +/- 4.1 months of follow-up. The number of injections per year was 1.32 +/- 1.56, the mean number of relapses was 1.11 +/- 1.83, and the mean number of relapses per year was 0.25 +/- 0.41. Conclusion(s): Perforating scleral vessels are more common among highly myopic patients suffering from neovascular complications. Myopic CNV complexes that are coincident with PSVs on optical coherence tomography show higher rates of activity, needing more injections to control them and being more prone to relapses.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - PURPOSE: To characterize peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation (PICC) in highly myopic participants and its associated risk factors. METHOD(S): This observational, cross-sectional study recruited 890 Chinese participants with bilateral high myopia, defined as <=-6.00 diopters spherical power. Fundus photography and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography were used to determine the presence of PICC, defined as a yellow-orange lesion adjacent to the disc border with a corresponding intrachoroidal hyporeflective space. RESULT(S): Among 890 participants, 884 right eyes were included for analysis. The rate of PICC was 3.6% (32 eyes). Peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation was observed in two eyes without myopic retinal lesions, nine eyes with tessellated fundus only, 16 eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, and five eyes with patchy chorioretinal atrophy. The most commonly affected area was inferior disc border (87.5%), followed by multiple (9.4%) and superior (3.1%) disc borders. The multiple linear logistic regression model showed that older age, more myopic spherical equivalent, and longer axial length were associated with the presence of PICC. CONCLUSION(S): Peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation was present in 3.6% of highly myopic eyes. It was more common in eyes with a higher myopic maculopathy category. Older age, more myopic spherical equivalent, and longer axial length were risk factors for the presence of PICC.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the progression of myopic maculopathy and associated factors in highly myopic Chinese children. METHOD(S): In this retrospective observational case series, biometric fundus features were morphometrically measured on photographs. Myopic maculopathy was defined as recommended by the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group. RESULT(S): The study included 274 children (mean age: 11.7 +/- 2.5 years; mean refractive error: -7.66 +/- 1.87 diopters [D]) with a mean follow-up of 4.9 +/- 1.2 years. Myopic maculopathy progression was detected in 52 eyes (18.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.3-23.7%). In multivariable analysis, myopic maculopathy progression was associated with a decrease in refractive error (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56-0.92; P < 0.001) (i.e., higher myopization) and enlargement of parapapillary gamma zone (OR: 7.68; 95% CI: 1.63-36.2; P = 0.002). Incident peripapillary diffuse choroidal atrophy, noted in 47 of 236 eyes (20.0%; 95% CI: 14.8-25.2%), was correlated with a decrease in refractive error (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54-0.92; P = 0.009) (i.e., higher myopization) and greater gamma zone enlargement (OR: 8.28; 95% CI: 1.33-51.7; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION(S): Myopia in schoolchildren may have a considerable risk of progressing to myopic maculopathy. Enlargement of parapapillary gamma zone was a main independent risk factor.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE. This retrospective study investigated the patterns and risk factors of progression of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) of fellow eyes after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) of primary eyes. METHODS. The study population comprised 153 patients with MTM in both myopic eyes who sequentially underwent PPV (2006-2021). Observation periods were from PPV of the primary eye (baseline) to PPV of the fellow (end). MTM was graded based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and the ATN (atrophy [A], traction [T], and neovascularization [N]) system. An increase in T grade was considered MTM progression. RESULTS. MTM progressed in 43.8% of fellow eyes during 34.57 +/- 34.08 months. The progression of fellow eyes correlated with T grade of primary eyes (P < 0.001). Risk factors for the progression of MTM in fellow eyes were primary eyes in T4-T5, age at baseline <60 years, and fellow eyes with partial posterior vitreous detachment (PVD; P < 0.001, P = 0.042, and P = 0.002, respectively). Fellow eyes in T1/T2 at baseline progressed faster compared with those in T0 (P < 0.001); the annual rate of progression to T3-T5 of the T0 (T1-T2) groups was 9.98% (24.59%). CONCLUSIONS. Risk factors for the progression of MTM in fellow eyes included PPV when relatively young, primary eye at high T grade, and partial PVD of the fellow eye. Personalized follow-up for fellow eyes should be based on the severity of MTM of both eyes.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

N2  - Aim: To investigate vascular changes of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) after ranibizumab treatment using optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA). Method(s): Consecutive subjects with a diagnosis of mCNV were included. Patients underwent intravitreal injection of ranibizumab treatment with a 6-month follow-up. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination and OCTA evaluation. The 3 x 3 OCTA en face images were analyzed for the absence/presence of mCNV, CNV area, and CNV network morphology. In particular, the morphology of the mCNV was analyzed in order to detect the presence/absence of feeder vessels. Result(s): Eleven subjects were evaluated. At baseline, the mCNV was identified in all cases on OCTA. At 6 months, the mean mCNV area was not statically significantly reduced in comparison with baseline values (p > 0.05), while the morphologic analysis revealed a complete disappearance of the feeder vessel in 6 eyes. The subgroup analysis of these latter showed that the CNV area was significantly reduced, visual acuity had improved, and only one intravitreal injection was administrated over the entire follow-up period. Conclusion(s): OCTA allowed the detection of qualitative and quantitative vascular changes in mCNV. The disappearance of the feeder vessel was associated with better anatomical as well as functional outcomes at the last follow-up visit.Copyright © 2019

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Pathological myopia is a severe case of myopia, i.e., nearsightedness. Pathological myopia is also known as degenerative myopia because it ultimately leads to blindness. In pathological myopia, certain myopia-specific pathologies occur at the eye's posterior i.e., Foster-Fuchs's spot, Cystoid degeneration, Liquefaction, Macular degeneration, Vitreous opacities, Weiss's reflex, Posterior staphyloma, etc. This research is aimed at developing a machine learning (ML) approach for the automatic detection of pathological myopia based on fundus images. A deep learning technique of convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed for this purpose. A CNN model is developed in Spyder. The fundus images are first preprocessed. The preprocessed images are then fed to the designed CNN model. The CNN model automatically extracts the features from the input images and classifies the images i.e., normal image or pathological myopia. The best performing CNN model achieved an AUC score of 0.9845. The best validation loss obtained is 0.1457. The results show that the model can be successfully employed to detect pathological myopia from the fundus images.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

N2  - To investigate the influence of age on the function and morphology of patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and to evaluate the effect and prognostic factors of recurrence of Conbercept treatment on mCNV patients over 50 years. A total of 64 patients (64 eyes) with mCNV were enrolled in this retrospective study. The differences in baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and morphological features on imaging between the younger group (< 50 years) and the older group (>=50 years) were analyzed. Of all, 21 eyes of 21 mCNV patients aged over 50 years who received Conbercept injection were further analyzed. Between the younger and the older group, significant differences were shown in mean BCVA (0.58+/-0.28 vs 0.77+/-0.31), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) (108.17+/-78.32 mum vs 54.68+/-39.03 mum) and frequency of vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (VIA) (2 vs 13), respectively (P<0.05). After treated with Conbercept, the mean BCVA of 21 older mCNV patients increased from 0.83+/-0.30 at baseline to 0.49+/-0.24 at one year. Baseline BCVA, external limiting membrane damage, CNV area and CNV location correlated with the visual acuity at the 1-year follow-up. There were 7 (33.3%) recurrent cases during the follow-up and the risk of recurrence in patients with baseline central macular thickness (CMT)>=262.86 mum was 14 times greater than that of patients with CMT<262.86 mum. The risk of recurrence increased 1.84 times for every 100-mum increment in the CMT. Patients over 50 years with mCNV had a worse BCVA, thinner choroid, and higher risk of VIA than young mCNV patients. The standard Conbercept treatment strategy was safe and effective in mCNV patients over 50 years. As patients over 50 years with a greater CMT have a high risk of recurrence, more attention should be paid on these patients by following them up closely.

N2  - Qualitative analysis of fundus photographs enables straightforward pattern recognition of advanced pathologic myopia. However, it has limitations in defining the classification of the degree or extent of early disease, such that it may be biased by subjective interpretation. In this study, we used the fovea, optic disc, and deepest point of the eye (DPE) as the three major markers (i.e., key indicators) of the posterior globe to quantify the relative tomographic elevation of the posterior sclera (TEPS). Using this quantitative index from eyes of 860 myopic patients, support vector machine based machine learning classifier predicted pathologic myopia an AUROC of 0.828, with 77.5% sensitivity and 88.07% specificity. Axial length and choroidal thickness, the existing quantitative indicator of pathologic myopia only reached an AUROC of 0.758, with 75.0% sensitivity and 76.61% specificity. When all six indices were applied (four TEPS, AxL, and SCT), the discriminative ability of the SVM model was excellent, demonstrating an AUROC of 0.868, with 80.0% sensitivity and 93.58% specificity. Our model provides an accurate modality for identification of patients with pathologic myopia and may help prioritize these patients for further treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To describe the natural course of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and determine predictive factors for its progression and visual prognosis. METHOD(S): This retrospective observational study included 113 MTM patients (113 eyes). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurements and optical coherence tomography findings were recorded. RESULT(S): Over a mean follow-up of 38.2+/-11.1 months, 49 of 113 eyes (43.4%) progressed. The progression rate of outer schisis prominently located in the fovea or posterior staphyloma was significantly higher than that of outer schisis prominently located in paravascular areas (P=0.0011). MTM with partial posterior vitreous detachment during the follow-up progressed more rapidly than MTM without (P=0.0447). Patients with older age (>65 years), without domed-shaped macula and with defects in the ellipsoid zone (EZ) had worse BCVA at the last visit (P=0.0416, P=0.0494and P=0.0130). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that BCVA and defects in the EZ at baseline were significantly associated with the final BCVA (P<0.0001 and P=<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): MTM has a high possibility for progression. Outer schisis located predominantly in the fovea or posterior staphyloma or with partial posterior vitreous detachment exhibits rapid progression. The integrity of the EZ is related to visual prognosis.Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: To compare morphological features of staphyloma (type and grade) with structural and functional outcomes in 11 patients with symptomatic myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM) who underwent macular buckle surgery. Method(s): A retrospective observational case series, where a chart review was conducted of the type (Curtin classification) and grade of staphyloma (USG B-scan based). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) macula analysis done preoperatively and postoperatively 1 and 6-8 weeks), Visual acuity was recorded in log mar. Result(s): With an average myopia of -10.35 D (-5 to -14.5 D), there were four patients with types II and IX staphyloma and seven with type I staphyloma. The average axial length was 28.6 +/- 0.98 mm in type II/IX and 26.2 +/- 0.8 mm in type I. Preoperative OCT features were outer retinal layer schisis (11), retinal detachment (foveal: 2, macular: 8), macular hole (lamellar: 3, full thickness: 4), and taut posterior hyaloid (3). Postoperatively, patients with type II/IX staphyloma had significant gain in visual acuity from 1.05 +/- 0.3 to 0.74 +/- 0.2 Log Mar. The structural features also responded better in patients with types II/IX staphyloma, with all patients having more than 90% reduction in schisis and retinal attachment at 6 weeks. Whereas only two patients with type I staphyloma had similar reduction in schisis at 6 weeks and only one had complete retinal attachment. Conclusion(s): In patients with MTM, the staphyloma characteristics preoperatively can help us prognosticate about structural and functional success after macular buckle surgery. In our small case series, patients with type II/IX staphyloma and larger axial length had better structural and functional outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Myopic maculopathy (MM) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and irreversible blindness in eyes with pathologic myopia (PM). However, the classification of each type of lesion associated with MM has not been determined. Recently, a new MM classification system, known as the ATN grading and classification system, was proposed; it is based on the fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and includes three variable components: atrophy (A), traction (T), and neovascularization (N). This study aimed to perform an independent evaluation of interobserver and intraobserver agreement for the recently developed ATN grading system for MM. METHOD(S): This was a retrospective study. Fundus photographs and OCT images of 125 patients (226 eyes) with various MMs were evaluated and classified using the ATN grading of the new MM classification system by four blinded and independent evaluators (2 attending ophthalmologists and 2 ophthalmic residents). All cases were randomly re-evaluated by the same observers after an interval of 6weeks. The kappa coefficient (kappa) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the interobserver and intraobserver agreement. RESULT(S): The interobserver agreement was substantial when considering the maculopathy type (A, T, and N). The weighted Fleiss kappa values for each MM type (A, T, and N) were 0.651 (95% CI: 0.602-0.700), 0.734 (95% CI: 0.689-0.779), and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.649-0.755), respectively. The interobserver agreement when considering the subtypes was good or excellent, except for stages A1, A2, and N1, in which the weighted kappa value was less than 0.6, with moderate agreement. The intraobserver agreement of types and subtypes was excellent, with kappa>0.8. No significant differences were observed between the attending ophthalmologists and residents for interobserver reliability or intraobserver reproducibility. CONCLUSION(S): The ATN classification allows an adequate agreement among ophthalmologists with different qualifications and by the same observer on separate occasions. Future prospective studies should further evaluate whether this classification can be better implemented in clinical decision-making and disease progression assessments.

N2  - Background To describe the clinical presentation and characteristic imaging features of deep retinal haemorrhages primarily located in the Henle fibre layer (HFL) of the macula. The spectrum of aetiologies and a comprehensive theory of pathogenesis are presented. Methods This is a retrospective, multicentre case series evaluating eyes with retinal haemorrhage in HFL. Clinical features, underlying aetiology, systemic and ocular risk factors, visual acuity, and multimodal imaging including fundus photography and cross-sectional and en face optical coherence tomography (OCT) are presented. Results Retinal haemorrhages localised to HFL in 33 eyes from 23 patients were secondary to acute blunt trauma to the head (n=2), eye (n=1) and trunk (n=1), ruptured intracranial aneurysm (Terson's syndrome, n=3), general anaesthesia (n=1), epidural anaesthesia (n=1), hypertension with anaemia (n=1), decompression retinopathy (n=1), postvitrectomy with intraocular gas (n=1), retinal vein occlusion (n=7), myopic degeneration (n=2), macular telangiectasia type 2 (n=1), and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (n=1). Defining clinical features included deep retinal haemorrhage with feathery margin and petaloid pattern radiating from the fovea. OCT demonstrated characteristic hyper-reflectivity from the haemorrhage delineated by obliquely oriented fibres in the Henle layer. Spontaneous resolution of HFL haemorrhage occurred after 3 months in 15 patients with follow-up. Conclusion The characteristic petaloid-shaped, deep intraretinal haemorrhage with a feathery margin localised to HFL is associated with various disorders. The terminology 'Henle fiber layer hemorrhage (HH)' is proposed to describe the clinical and OCT findings, which may result from abnormal retinal venous pressure from systemic or local retinovascular disorders affecting the deep capillary plexus or from choroidal vascular abnormalities.Copyright ©

N2  - Background and Objectives: Pathological myopia (PM) is the seventh leading cause of blindness, with a reported global prevalence up to 3%. Early and automated PM detection from fundus images could aid to prevent blindness in a world population that is characterized by a rising myopia prevalence. We aim to assess the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the detection of PM and semantic segmentation of myopia-induced lesions from fundus images on a recently introduced reference data set. Method(s): This investigation reports on the results of CNNs developed for the recently introduced Pathological Myopia (PALM) dataset, which consists of 1200 images. Our CNN bundles lesion segmentation and PM classification, as the two tasks are heavily intertwined. Domain knowledge is also inserted through the introduction of a new Optic Nerve Head (ONH)-based prediction enhancement for the segmentation of atrophy and fovea localization. Finally, we are the first to approach fovea localization using segmentation instead of detection or regression models. Evaluation metrics include area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for PM detection, Euclidean distance for fovea localization, and Dice and F1 metrics for the semantic segmentation tasks (optic disc, retinal atrophy and retinal detachment). Result(s): Models trained with 400 available training images achieved an AUC of 0.9867 for PM detection, and a Euclidean distance of 58.27 pixels on the fovea localization task, evaluated on a test set of 400 images. Dice and F1 metrics for semantic segmentation of lesions scored 0.9303 and 0.9869 on optic disc, 0.8001 and 0.9135 on retinal atrophy, and 0.8073 and 0.7059 on retinal detachment, respectively. Conclusion(s): We report a successful approach for a simultaneous classification of pathological myopia and segmentation of associated lesions. Our work was acknowledged with an award in the context of the "Pathological Myopia detection from retinal images" challenge held during the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (April 2019). Considering that (pathological) myopia cases are often identified as false positives and negatives in glaucoma deep learning models, we envisage that the current work could aid in future research to discriminate between glaucomatous and highly-myopic eyes, complemented by the localization and segmentation of landmarks such as fovea, optic disc and atrophy.Copyright © 2020

N2  - Aim To prospectively determine the impact of choroidal thickness (CT) on the myopic maculopathy progression. Methods This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational study. In total, 434 participants aged 7-70 years with bilateral high myopia (<=-6 D spherical error, range,-6 to-27.0 D) completed follow-up visits for 2 years. The baseline CT centred on the fovea was measured using a swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT). Myopic maculopathy progression was determined by fundus photography. Logistic model was used to examine the impact of CT at baseline on the myopic maculopathy progression. Likelihood ratio test was adopted for model comparison. Results The mean baseline age, spherical equivalence and subfoveal CT (SFCT) of the participants were 23.2+/-12.5 years,-10.50+/-3.18 D and 153.20+/-72.76 mum, respectively. Over 2-year's follow-up, 74 of 434 eyes (17.1%) had myopic maculopathy progression. Baseline SFCT was thinner in eyes with myopic maculopathy progression than those without (67.26+/-37.67 mum vs 170.95+/-65.45 mum; mean difference, 99.31 mum; 95% CI 83.61 to 115.01 mum; p<0.001). The same patterns of differences were observed in 7-18 years, 19-39 years and 40-70 years. In multivariate logistic regression model, SFCT was a significant risk factor (adjusted OR=0.97, p<0.005) when age, gender, axial length and baseline myopic maculopathy category were adjusted for. The addition of SFCT significantly improved the predictive discrimination of myopic maculopathy progression in comparison with that included established risk factors alone (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.899 vs 0.942, p<0.001). Conclusion CT is an independent predictor for myopic maculopathy progression.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: To describe the application of a modified Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) surgical implantation technique in vitrectomized eyes, in order to minimize the risk of early postoperative hypotony, which leads to hemorrhagic complications. Material(s) and Method(s): Data of patients implanted with AGV using the surgical technique described were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criterion: glaucomatous eyes with previous history of pars plana vitrectomy. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement and ophthalmic examination were performed preoperatively and postoperatively weekly for 1 month for the detection of early hypotony, choroidal effusion/detachment, intraocular hemorrhage. The surgical technique consisted in creating a 5 mm long scleral tunnel with a 23 G needle reaching the anterior chamber at the iridocorneal angle, in which the Ahmed glaucoma valve tube was inserted. Result(s): Ten eyes of 10 patients were included. Median preoperative IOP was 30.5 mmHg [interquartile range (IQR) 28.3-33.0]; median postoperative IOP was 12.0 mmHg (IQR 9.3-13.0) at 1 week, and 12.5 mmHg (IQR 11.0-15.0) at 1 month. In no cases postoperative IOP was <8 mmHg. On the first postoperative day, five (50%) eyes showed few blood clots in the anterior chamber. On the second-week appointment, moderate choroidal effusion was observed in two eyes (20%). No hemorrhagic complications were observed. Conclusion(s): The creation of a long intrascleral tunnel with a 23 G needle for AGV implantation in vitrectomized eyes could be effective in decreasing leakage through the space between the valve tube and the sclerocorneal tissue. This technique is safe, easy to perform, feasible and fast. Due to its advantages and good postoperative results, it could also be adopted in non-vitrectomized eyes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the effect and safety of fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling (FSIP) for myopic traction maculopathy comparing with that of total ILM peeling (TP). Method(s): PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane, EBSCO and CNKI, published until January 2020, were searched. Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), postoperative central foveal thickness (CFT), the rate of visual improvement and anatomic success were the main outcome parameters, and the secondary outcome parameters were postoperative complications. Random-effects models were chosen in regard with multi-studies. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and odds ratio (OR) were applied as effect sizes of continuous and binomial data, respectively. Result(s): Six comparative studies involving 193 eyes were included. Better postoperative BCVA was detected in the FSIP group (SMD = -0.39, 95%CI: -0.69 to -0.09, p = 0.01). The FSIP group had a higher rate of vision improvement with statistical significance (OR = 3.86, 95%CI: 1.36 to 10.97, p = 0.01). Both surgical methods had similar outcomes for postoperative CFT (SMD = 0.07, 95%CI: -0.27 to 0.40, p = 0.70). The FSIP group had a higher rate of anatomic success, though there was no obvious significance (OR = 2.54, 95%CI: 0.96 to 6.74, p = 0.06). For the development of postoperative full-thickness macular hole (FTMH), the rate was lower in the FSIP group (OR = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.05 to 0.64, p = 0.008). Conclusion(s): Vitrectomy with fovea-sparing ILM peeling for myopic traction maculopathy could gain better visual outcomes and decrease incidence of FTMH development, though there was no obvious difference in postoperative CFT and the rate of anatomic success between two groups.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Background: To analyse the feasibility and efficacy of a novel autologous plasma rich in growth factor (PRGF) preparation as adjuvant to pars plana vitrectomy and internal limiting membrane peel in high myopic full-thickness macular hole (FTMH). Method(s): Single-centre, single-surgeon retrospective chart review of consecutive patients with high myopic FTMH who underwent surgery with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Patients were divided in group 1 (naive) and group 2 (persistent). Quantitative and qualitative variables were analysed, compared among groups and correlated with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Result(s): Postoperatively, FTMH resolved in 28/31 eyes in group 1 (90%) and in 10/11 eyes in group 2 (91%), without significant differences (p = 0.954). None of the preoperative anatomical variables analysed showed significant association with preoperative BCVA. Intraoperatively, no significant complications were registered. Postoperatively, BCVA improved significantly in the studied population (p < 0.001). Preoperative factors associated with better postoperative BCVA were the presence of intraretinal cystoid spaces (p = 0.028) and elevated FTMH borders (p = 0.005). Preoperative dome-shaped macula was associated with significantly worse postoperative BCVA (p = 0.049). Conclusion(s): The use of PRGF as adjuvant to vitrectomy showed to be reproducible, straightforward and efficient, with primary anatomical success rate comparable to other surgical approaches and lower risk of complications.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Purpose: Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is a major diagnostic modality but the clinical implications of specific staining patterns in active myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) are unclear. We examined the associations of ICGA cyanofluorescence patterns with disease characteristics and response to an as-needed intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) treatment regimen among active mCNV patients. Method(s): Twenty-four subjects with active mCNV treated by IVR were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Information from medical records were reviewed, including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiography (FA) findings, ICGA cyanofluorescence patterns, and spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) results. The CNV lesion size, CNV thickness, and central retinal thickness (CRT) were measured from these images. Result(s): Two staining patterns were identified on late-phase ICGA images, hypercyanescence (9/24, 37.5%) and non-hypercyanescence (15/24, 62.5%). There were no differences in baseline BCVA, CNV thickness, and CRT between ICGA pattern groups; however, the hypercyanescence group demonstrated a larger CNV lesion size (p = 0.035) and required more IVR injections than the non-hypercyanescence group (2.67 +/- 1.58 vs 1.07 +/- 0.27, p = 0.016), while the non-hypercyanescence group demonstrated better final BCVA improvement (p = 0.041). Hypercyanescence could be divided into two types, a uniform type and rim type. A pseudopodia-like protrusion of CNV enlargement with a rim-enhanced type hypercyanescence at the protrusion rim was predictive of required retreatment. Conclusion(s): Hypercyanescence on late-phase ICGA may assist in identifying more active mCNV requiring intensive treatment.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Purpose: To determine whether eyes with pathologic myopia can be identified and whether each type of myopic maculopathy lesion on fundus photographs can be diagnosed by deep learning (DL) algorithms. Design(s): A DL algorithm was developed to recognize myopic maculopathy features and to categorize the myopic maculopathy automatically. Participant(s): We examined 7020 fundus images from 4432 highly myopic eyes obtained from the Advanced Clinical Center for Myopia. Method(s): Deep learning (DL) algorithms were developed to recognize the key features of myopic maculopathy with 5176 fundus images. These algorithms were also used to develop a Meta-analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) study categorizing system (CS) by adding a specific processing layer. Models and the system were evaluated by 1844 fundus image. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were used to determine the performance of each DL algorithm. The rate of correct predictions was used to determine the performance of the META-PM study CS. Main Outcome Measure(s): Four trained DL models were able to recognize the lesions of myopic maculopathy accurately with high sensitivity and specificity. The META-PM study CS also showed a high accuracy and was qualified to be used in a semiautomated way during screening for myopic maculopathy in highly myopic eyes. Result(s): The sensitivity of the DL models was 84.44% for diffuse atrophy, 87.22% for patchy atrophy, 85.10% for macular atrophy, and 37.07% for choroidal neovascularization, and the AUC values were 0.970, 0.978, 0.982, and 0.881, respectively. The rate of total correct predictions from the META-PM study CS was 87.53%, with rates of 90.18%, 95.28%, 97.50%, and 91.14%, respectively, for each type of lesion. The META-PM study CS showed an overall rate of 92.08% in detecting pathologic myopia correctly, which was defined as having myopic maculopathy equal to or more serious than diffuse atrophy. Conclusion(s): The novel DL models and system can achieve high sensitivity and specificity in identifying the different types of lesions of myopic maculopathy. These results will assist in the screening for pathologic myopia and subsequent protection of patients against low vision and blindness caused by myopic maculopathy.Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate choroidal arterial watershed zones (CWZ) in highly myopic patients. The relationships between CWZ location and myopic maculopathy location and classification were also examined. Method(s): This retrospective study included 102 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with myopic maculopathy. Indocyanine green videoangiography was used to evaluate CWZ presence, location, and configuration. Maculopathy signs were used to examine the relationship between CWZ and myopic maculopathy. Result(s): Various CWZ types were identified in 102 of 158 eyes. The CWZ patterns were classified as vertical optic nerve head (vertical-ONH) in 30 eyes, stellate in 29 eyes, vertical-ONH extending to the macula in 28 eyes, horizontal fovea in eight eyes, and vertical parafovea in seven eyes. Choroidal neovascularization occurred within CWZs in 35 of 42 eyes, and macular atrophy was located within foveal CWZs in 20 of 23 eyes. The CWZ type was significantly correlated with mCNV presence (OR = 5.652, P = 0.014). Conclusion(s): Variations in CWZ topography are associated with myopic maculopathy, particularly in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and macular atrophy, and CWZ is a risk factor for mCNV. This suggests that eyes with macular CWZs are vulnerable to developing myopic maculopathy and are predisposed to mCNV because of ischaemic hypoxia.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

N2  - First described by Gaucher and associates in 2008 in eyes with high myopia, dome-shaped maculopathy (DSM) is an anterior convex protrusion of the macula towards the vitreous cavity observable on OCT. This seems to be related to a localized scleral thickness, which might be the result of regional variation in the scleral bio-mechanical properties and the process of emmetropization causing asymmetric scleral growth. The presence of DSM can be associated with an increased risk of complications. The clinical spectrum ranges from being asymptomatic to metamorphopsia and mild-to-moderate gradual visual loss over years. Visual impairment in DSM results from retinal pigment epithelial changes, sub-foveal serous detachment, retinoschisis and myopic choroidal neovascularization. In this review, we compile and review the available information on the pathophysiology, nomenclature, classification, clinical features including imaging, differential diagnosis, complications associated with DSM and the gaps in our understanding of this entity thus far.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

N2  - In this narrative-review, we report the most recent data from the literature of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Myopic CNV is the most frequent sight-threatening complication of pathologic myopia. The natural course of mCNV can result in expanding macular atrophy and /or fibrosis, leading to irreversible visual loss after 5 years. Retinal multimodal imaging is mandatory for early diagnosis and monitoring of the disease during treatment. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment option for mCNV. Prompt treatment of active mCNV with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in terms of visual outcome improvements reducing the occurrence of late-stage complications.Copyright © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to explore the current prevalence, causes, and factors associated with visual impairment in a Chinese elderly population. Method(s): A random sample of 2164 candidates aged >=70 years was selected. Among them, 1914 participants (response rate: 88.4%) underwent comprehensive eye examinations. The prevalence and causes of visual impairment were estimated, and the associated factors were identified. Result(s): The standardized prevalence of mild visual impairment (<6/12 to >=6/18), moderate to severe visual impairment (MSVI) (<6/18 to >=3/60), and blindness (<3/60) in the better eye were 20.5%, 25.8%, and 3.4%, respectively. The leading cause of visual impairment was cataract (49.7%), followed by uncorrected refractive error (26.5%), myopic maculopathy (5.8%), and posterior capsular opacification (5.5%). Optical coherence tomography revealed that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities were the third most common cause of monocular mild visual impairment (2.2%) and MSVI (4.4%) in the elderly population. A large number of patients with visual impairment (81.7%) were amenable to undergo the interventions. Visual impairment was associated with advanced age (odds ratio [OR], 1.09 per year; p<0.001), female sex (OR, 1.59; p=0.003), self-reported visual impairment (OR, 1.91; p<0.001), cognitive impairment (OR, 1.40, p=0.005), and high educational level (OR, 0.75; primary, p=0.045; and OR, 0.53, secondary or higher; p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Visual impairment was common in the Chinese elderly population and a severe health and social problem. Practicable policies are urgently needed to popularize eye health knowledge and promote treatments for visual impairment in elderly people in rural China.Copyright © 2021 Shen et al.

N2  - The choroid is the vascular layer of the eye that supplies photoreceptors with oxygen. Changes in the choroid are associated with many pathologies including myopia where the choroid progressively thins due to axial elongation. To quantize these changes, there is a need to automatically and accurately segment the choroidal layer from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. In this paper, we propose a multi-Task learning approach to segment the choroid from three-dimensional OCT images. Our proposed architecture aggregates the spatial context from adjacent cross-sectional slices to reconstruct the central slice. Spatial context learned by this reconstruction mechanism is then fused with a U-Net based architecture for segmentation. The proposed approach was evaluated on volumetric OCT scans of 166 myopic eyes acquired with a commercial OCT system, and achieved a cross-validation Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 94.69% which significantly outperformed (p<0.001) the other state-of-The-Art methods on the same data set. Choroidal thickness maps generated by our approach also achieved a better structural similarity index (SSIM) of 72.11% with respect to the groundtruth. In particular, our approach performs well for highly challenging eyes with thinner choroids. Compared to other methods, our proposed approach also requires lesser processing time and has lower computational requirements. The results suggest that our proposed approach could potentially be used as a fast and reliable method for automated choroidal segmentation.Copyright © 2021 OSA - The Optical Society.

N2  - Fundus imaging is a retinal image modality for capturing anatomical structures and abnormalities in the human eye. Fundus images are the primary tool for observation and detection of a wide range of ophthalmological diseases. Changes in and around the anatomical structures like blood vessels, optic disc, fovea, and macula indicate the presence of disease like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), myopia, hypertension, and cataract. The patient may be suffering from more than one ophthalmological disease observed in either or both the eyes. Two models are proposed for multi-class multi-label fundus images classification of ophthalmological diseases using transfer learning based convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches. Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) database having fundus images of left and right eye of patients for eight categories is used for experimentation. Four different pre-trained CNN architectures with two different optimizers are used and it is observed that VGG16 pre-trained architecture with SGD optimizer performs better for multi-class multi-label fundus images classification on ODIR database.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the prevalence and visual outcomes of macular Bruch membrane (BM) defects in patients treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) for choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathological myopia (mCNV). Method(s): Single-center retrospective observational case series of 68 eyes from 62 patients with mCNV treated with one anti-VEGF injection followed by a pro re nata (1 + PRN) regimen. A minimum follow-up of 6 months was defined. Chorioretinal atrophy was assessed by fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and SD-OCT. Result(s): Median follow-up was 28.5 (range 6-89) months with a median number of 5 anti-VEGF injections. At baseline, 27.9% of eyes had macular BM defects increasing to 36.8% during follow-up (p<0.001). Eyes without macular BM defects at the baseline had higher BCVA at the last observation than patients with BM defects (p=0.003). An increase of 5 or more ETDRS letters was more frequent in eyes without BM defects (p=0.001). At the end of follow-up, mCNV-related macular atrophy was present in 44.1%; out of which, 83.3% presented macular BM defects (p<0.001). Eyes with mCNV-related macular atrophy without BM defects had a significant increase of best-corrected visual acuity compared with eyes with mCNV-related macular atrophy and BM defect (p=0.002). Conclusion(s): Macular Bruch membrane defects are often seen in mCNV and have a significant impact in visual acuity and prognosis. Eyes with macular BM defects have a poorer response and worse visual outcomes after anti-VEGF therapy.

N2  - Background/Aims To develop a deep learning system for automated glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) detection using ultra-widefield fundus (UWF) images. Methods We trained, validated and externally evaluated a deep learning system for GON detection based on 22 972 UWF images from 10 590 subjects that were collected at 4 different institutions in China and Japan. The InceptionResNetV2 neural network architecture was used to develop the system. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were used to assess the performance of detecting GON by the system. The data set from the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) was selected to compare the performance of the system to that of ophthalmologists who mainly conducted UWF image analysis in clinics. Results The system for GON detection achieved AUCs of 0.983-0.999 with sensitivities of 97.5-98.2% and specificities of 94.3-98.4% in four independent data sets. The most common reasons for false-negative results were confounding optic disc characteristics caused by high myopia or pathological myopia (n=39 (53%)). The leading cause for false-positive results was having other fundus lesions (n=401 (96%)). The performance of the system in the ZOC data set was comparable to that of an experienced ophthalmologist (p>0.05). Conclusion Our deep learning system can accurately detect GON from UWF images in an automated fashion. It may be used as a screening tool to improve the accessibility of screening and promote the early diagnosis and management of glaucoma.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

N2  - Purpose: To identify the profile of a pediatric low-vision population and investigate the differences between low-vision services in urban and rural areas. Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted of the records of 286 consecutive children presenting at the Low Vision Clinic of the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University from January 2009 to December 2018. The data retrieved included age, sex, education, family history, rural vs. urban residence, cause of visual impairment, and low-vision aids dispensed. Result(s): Of the 286 children (65.0% boys and 35.0% girls), over half (178, 62.2%) were from urban areas. The age range of the patients was 3-15 years (mean 9.54 +/- 4.11). The four major causes of visual impairment were congenital cataract (70, 24.5%), optic atrophy (37, 12.9%), congenital glaucoma (34, 11.9%), and macular dystrophy (31, 10.8%). Low-vision aids were prescribed for 203 children (71.0%), with binocular telescopes (69, 25.0%) and stand magnifiers (66, 23.9%) being the most common. The urban children enjoyed higher rates of low-vision services than the rural children, with more low-vision aids (192, 94.6%) prescribed for the former. Conclusion(s): Congenital and hereditary diseases constituted the major causes of low vision in the study population. In contrast to their urban counterparts, the rural children experienced inadequate low-vision rehabilitation. Our findings suggest that policymakers need to better address gender inequalities and urban-rural disparities in low-vision services and that the coverage of low-vision services, especially in rural areas, should be enhanced in China.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the microvasculature and structural characteristics of the eyes of myopic patients and their association with posterior staphyloma (PS). Method(s): This was a retrospective, case-control study comprising of 106 eyes from 72 individuals. Using 1:1 matching of axial length (AL) of their eyes, patients were allocated into a PS group or no posterior staphyloma (NPS) group. All patients were examined using ultra-widefield fundus imaging, optical coherence tomography angiography, and ocular biometry to acquire microvasculature and microstructure parameters. Result(s): The anterior chamber depth (ACD) of the PS group was significantly different from that of the NPS group (3.56 mm vs 3.76 mm, P < 0.001), as was 1ens thickness (3.72 mm vs 3.57 mm, P = 0.005) and spherical equivalent (SE)(-10.11D vs -8.80D, P = 0.014). The PS group had reduced choriocapillaris flow, subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), and a thinner retinal layer compared with the NPS group. No difference in retinal blood flow between the two groups was observed. The PS group exhibited a smaller disc area (15082.89 vs 17,043.32, P = 0.003) and angle alpha between temporal retinal arterial vascular arcades (113.29degreevs 128.39degree, P = 0.003), a larger disc tilt ratio (1.41 vs 1.24, P < 0.001) and parapapillary atrophy (PPA) area (13840.98 vs 8753.86, P = 0.020), compared with the NPS group. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that disc tilt ratio (P = 0.031) and SFCT (P = 0.015) were significant predictors of PS. In addition, PS (P = 0.049), AL (P = 0.003), corneal refractive power (P < 0.001), ACD (P = 0.022), relative lens position (P = 0.045), and disc area (P = 0.011) were significant predictors of SE. Conclusion(s): PS was found to be closely linked to a reduction in choriocapillaris perfusion and anatomical abnormalities including posterior and anterior segments. Furthermore, PS exacerbated the progression of myopia.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to quantitative assess the fundus tessellated density (FTD) and associated factors on the basis of fundus photographs using artificial intelligence. Method(s): A detailed examination of 3468 individuals was performed. The proposed method for FTD measurements consists of image preprocessing, sample labeling, deep learning segmentation model, and FTD calculation. Fundus tessellation was extracted as region of interest and then the FTD could be obtained by calculating the average exposed choroid area of per unit area of fundus. Besides, univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis have been conducted for the statistical analysis. Result(s): The mean FTD was 0.14 +/- 0.08 (median, 0.13; range, 0-0.39). In multivariate analysis, FTD was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with thinner subfoveal choroidal thickness, longer axial length, larger parapapillary atrophy, older age, male sex and lower body mass index. Correlation analysis suggested that the FTD increased by 33.1% (r = 0.33, P < .001) for each decade of life. Besides, correlation analysis indicated the negative correlation between FTD and spherical equivalent (SE) in the myopia participants (r = -0.25, P < 0.001), and no correlations between FTD and SE in the hyperme-tropia and emmetropic participants. Conclusion(s): It is feasible and efficient to extract FTD information from fundus images by artificial intelligence-based imaging processing. FTD can be widely used in population screening as a new quantitative biomarker for the thickness of the subfoveal choroid. The association between FTD with pathological myopia and lower visual acuity warrants further investigation. Translational Relevance: Artificial intelligence can extract valuable clinical biomarkers from fundus images and assist in population screening.Copyright © 2021, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc..

N2  - Background: Myopic maculopathy (MM) is the most serious and irreversible complication of pathologic myopia, which is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. Clinic proposed limited number of factors related to MM. To explore additional features strongly related with MM from optic disc region, we employ a machine learning based radiomics analysis method, which could explore and quantify more hidden or imperceptible MM-related features to the naked eyes and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of MM and therefore may assist to distinguish the high-risk population in an early stage. Method(s): A total of 457 eyes (313 patients) were enrolled and were divided into severe MM group and without severe MM group. Radiomics analysis was applied to depict features significantly correlated with severe MM from optic disc region. Receiver Operating Characteristic were used to evaluate these features' performance of classifying severe MM. Result(s): Eight new MM-related image features were discovered from the optic disc region, which described the shapes, textural patterns and intensity distributions of optic disc region. Compared with clinically reported MM-related features, these newly discovered features exhibited better abilities on severe MM classification. And the mean values of most features were markedly changed between patients with peripapillary diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (PDCA) and macular diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (MDCA). Conclusion(s): Machine learning and radiomics method are useful tools for mining more MM-related features from the optic disc region, by which complex or even hidden MM-related features can be discovered and decoded. In this paper, eight new MM-related image features were found, which would be useful for further quantitative study of MM-progression. As a nontrivial byproduct, marked changes between PDCA and MDCA was discovered by both new image features and clinic features.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Purposes: To investigate the patterns of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) in patients with different grades of myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM). Method(s): Patients with MAM who visited Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 2018 to December 2019 were screened. All patients received comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations as well as FAF imaging. The atrophic severity of each eye was identified based on the META-PM classification system, including no myopic retinal lesions (C0), tessellated fundus only (C1), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (C2), patchy chorioretinal atrophy (C3), and macular atrophy (C4). Result(s): Eighty-nine consecutive patients with 137 affected eyes were included. Four different autofluorescence (AF) patterns were detected: unremarkable AF (48 eyes in C1 and 18 eyes in C2, 48.2%), compound AF (2 eyes in C1 and 12 eyes in C2, 10.2%), patchy AF defect (5 eyes in C2 and 34 eyes in C3, 28.5%), and macular AF defect (18 eyes in C4, 13.1%). Moreover, AF patterns were significantly correlated with age (r = 0.419, P < .001), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (r = 0.592, P < .001), axial length (AL) (r = 0.529, P < .001), and subfovial choroidal thickness (SFCT) (r = -0.728, P < .001). In addition, with the help of FAF, 14.3% (5/35) of eyes initially categorized as C2 merely based on color fundus photographs (CFP) should be categorized as C3. Conclusion(s): The severity of FAF in eyes with MAM was significantly correlated with myopic characteristics. FAF might be beneficial for detecting unremarkable patchy chorioretinal atrophy on CFP of MAM.Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Purpose: To establish quantitative profile of the morphologic changes among patients with active myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) before and after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to assess the therapeutic response. Method(s): Patients with active mCNV who received anti-VEGF injections between February 2017 to October 2020 and fit the study criteria were retrospectively reviewed. Quantitative analysis of their OCTA images were carried out to evaluate the morphologic features and vascular changes of mCNV lesions in response to anti-VEGF therapy. For further quantitative profiling, mCNV area, fractal dimension, vessel area, vessel density, vessel diameter, vessel length, vessel junction, junction density, and vessel tortuosity were obtained by means of advanced skeletonization postprocessing analyses. Result(s): Thirty-one eyes of 29 consecutive patients with OCTA-positive mCNV lesions (mean spherical equivalent: -12.55 +/- 3.24 diopters) were included. The 31 cases were divided into two phenotypes at baseline: organized interlacing pattern (83.87%) and disorganized vascular loops pattern (16.13%). The values of mCNV area, fractal dimension, vessel area, vessel length, vessel junction, and junction density decreased remarkably 1 month after the initial anti-VEGF injection (p < 0.001). Although, vessel density, vessel diameter, and vessel tortuosity increased meanwhile, only vessel diameter displayed statistical significance (p = 0.027). Of note, relative ratio analysis showed that vessel junction was the most sensitive biomarker in response to anti-VEGF therapy, reflecting a mean decrease of 50.36%. Sensitivity lowered successively in biomarkers of vessel length, vessel area, junction density, mCNV area, and fractal dimension. In addition, percent change of mCNV area (r = 0.552, p = 0.002), fractal dimension (r = 0.446, p = 0.017), vessel area (r = 0.518, p = 0.005), and vessel length (r = 0.440, p = 0.019) were moderately associated with that of central retinal thickness. Conclusion(s): The study showed morphological as well as quantitative changes on OCTA responding to anti-VEGF treatment in mCNV patients, among which vessel junctions might be the most predictive biomarker. OCTA-based analysis, providing intuitive images and a large spectrum of quantitative data at the same time, could promote new insights into the therapeutic response assessment in mCNV patients.© Copyright © 2021 Wang, Hu, Zhu, Su, Fang, Lin, Chen, Su, Ye, Ma, Zhang, Li, Feng, Sun, Zhang and Shentu.

N2  - Purpose: To describe a comprehensive OCT-based classification of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). Method(s): Two hundred eighty-one eyes with MTM (visited from 2006 to 2018), were retrospectively reviewed for age, best-corrected-visual-acuity (BCVA), axial length (AL), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and wide-field color fundus-photographs. The study was divided in two Phases. Phase 1: MTM types were categorized with OCT and correlated with age and BCVA. The type of staphyloma was described. Phase 2: the evolution of MTM was studied evaluating at least three OCT exams of each eye taken at different timings (interval between each exam: 1-10 years). Result(s): Phase 1: We identified, four MTM retinal stages (1. Inner/Outer Maculoschisis; 2. Predominantly outer Maculoschisis; 3. Maculoschisis-Macular Detachment; 4. Macular Detachment) and three foveal stages (a. Normal fovea; b. Inner Lamellar-Macular-Hole; c. Full-Thickness-Macular-Hole). Outer-Lamellar-Macular-Holes and epiretinal abnormalities were associated findings. Stages 1 to 2 were younger than stages 3 to 4 (p < 0.05). BCVA in stages 1, 2 was similar, and higher than stages 3, 4 (p < 0.02). About 14% of eyes had no staphyloma, 73% of eyes had staphyloma type 1 or 2. MTM stages were not correlated with AL. Phase 2: The retina could change in time from stage 1 to 4, or the fovea could change from stage a to c. Mean evolution time from stage 1 to 2, stage 2 to 3, and 3 to 4 were 20, 12, 3 months, respectively. BCVA decreased over time as stages increased (p = 0.47). Conclusion(s): The MSS Table displays a new classification, the natural evolution, and practical insights for the management of MTM.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Background: By 2050, almost 5 billion people globally are projected to have myopia, of whom 20% are likely to have high myopia with clinically significant risk of sight-threatening complications such as myopic macular degeneration. These are diagnoses that typically require specialist assessment or measurement with multiple unconnected pieces of equipment. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches might be effective for risk stratification and to identify individuals at highest risk of visual loss. However, unresolved challenges for AI medical studies remain, including paucity of transparency, auditability, and traceability. Method(s): In this retrospective multicohort study, we developed and tested retinal photograph-based deep learning algorithms for detection of myopic macular degeneration and high myopia, using a total of 226 686 retinal images. First we trained and internally validated the algorithms on datasets from Singapore, and then externally tested them on datasets from China, Taiwan, India, Russia, and the UK. We also compared the performance of the deep learning algorithms against six human experts in the grading of a randomly selected dataset of 400 images from the external datasets. As proof of concept, we used a blockchain-based AI platform to demonstrate the real-world application of secure data transfer, model transfer, and model testing across three sites in Singapore and China. Finding(s): The deep learning algorithms showed robust diagnostic performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves [AUC] of 0.969 (95% CI 0.959-0.977) or higher for myopic macular degeneration and 0.913 (0.906-0.920) or higher for high myopia across the external testing datasets with available data. In the randomly selected dataset, the deep learning algorithms outperformed all six expert graders in detection of each condition (AUC of 0.978 [0.957-0.994] for myopic macular degeneration and 0.973 [0.941-0.995] for high myopia). We also successfully used blockchain technology for data transfer, model transfer, and model testing between sites and across two countries. Interpretation(s): Deep learning algorithms can be effective tools for risk stratification and screening of myopic macular degeneration and high myopia among the large global population with myopia. The blockchain platform developed here could potentially serve as a trusted platform for performance testing of future AI models in medicine. Funding(s): None.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the most severe form of retinopathy and cone/cone-rod dystrophy (CORD) is a common form of inherited retinopathy. Variants in GUCY2D constitute the most common cause of LCA and autosomal dominant CORD (ADCORD). The purpose of this study was to reveal novel variants and document associated phenotypes of patients with GUCY2D-associated retinopathy. Fifty-two potentially pathogenic variants (PPVs), including 12 novel ones (p.Gly144_Ala164del, p.Trp154Glyfs*12, p.Leu186Pro, p.Ala207Pro, p.Ala229Asp, p.Ala353Glu, p.Trp372*, p.Arg528*, p.Arg660Pro, p.Ile682Thr, p.Trp788Cys, and c.1026 + 171_*486del), were identified in 16 families with ADCORD and 34 families with autosomal recessive LCA (ARLCA). The novel variant c.1026 + 171_*486del is a large-scale (16.3 kb) deletion involving exons 4-20 of GUCY2D, and was identified in an ARLCA family in heterozygous status mimicking a homozygous p.Trp788Cys variant. Among the detected 52 PPVs, 32 (61.5%) were missense, seven (13.5%) were splicing, six (11.5%) were nonsense, four (7.7%) were inframe indel, and three (5.8%) were frameshift deletion. The median age of examination in 27 patients with ADCORD was 21.0 years (ranges 3-54) with a median visual acuity (VA) of 0.10 (ranges 0.02-0.90). There were 48.0% of patients with macular atrophy, 86.4% with severe reduced or extinguished cone responses, 77.3% with normal or mildly reduced rod responses, and 60.9% with high myopia. Visual impairment, macular dystrophy, and cone dysfunction deteriorated with age. The median age of examination in 34 patients with ARLCA was 1.1 years (ranges 0.3-25). There were 55.9% of patients with roving nystagmus, 68.2% with VA of worse than hand motion, 59.4% with almost normal fundus, 90.6% with extinguished rod and cone responses, and 50.0% with high hyperopia. In conclusions, twelve novel PPVs in GUCY2D (including a novel large-scale deletion) were identified. Most (32/52, 61.5%) of causative GUCY2D variants were missense. Progressive development of macular atrophy, cone dysfunction, visual impairment, and myopia are four major characteristics of GUCY2D-associated ADCORD. Normal fundus, roving nystagmus, and hypermetropia in early age are common findings specific to GUCY2D-associated ARLCA. The obtained data in this study will be of value in counselling patients and designing future therapeutic approaches.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Background: The risk of pathologic myopia (PM) increases with worsening myopia and may be related to retinal microvasculature alterations. To evaluate this, we analyzed the macular microvasculature of myopes with swept source-optical coherence tomographic angiography (SS-OCTA) in adolescent and young adult Singaporeans. Method(s): This is a prevalent case-control study including 93 young Chinese from the Strabismus, Amblyopia and Refractive error in Singaporean children (STARS, N = 45) study and the Singapore Cohort Study of Risk Factors for Myopia (SCORM, N = 48) studies. Macular vessel density (VD) measurements were obtained from 3 x 3 mm SS-OCTA scans and independently assessed using ImageJ. These measurements were compared between individuals with non-high myopia [non-HM, N = 40; SE >-5.0 diopter (D)] and HM (SE <=-5.0D, N = 53). Result(s): The mean macular VD was 40.9 +/- 0.6% and 38.2 +/- 0.5% in the non-HM and HM, groups, respectively (p = 0.01 adjusted for age and gender). Mean FAZ area in the superficial layer was 0.22 +/- 0.02 mm2 in the HM group, which was smaller compared to non-HM group (0.32 +/- 0.03 mm2, p = 0.04). Mean deep FAZ area was similar between the two groups (0.45 +/- 0.03 mm2 and 0.48 +/- 0.04 mm2 in the HM and non-HM groups, respectively, p = 0.70). Conclusion(s): VD was lower and superficial FAZ area was smaller, in adolescents and young adults with HM compared to non-HM. These findings require validation in prospective studies to assess their impact on the subsequent development of PM.© Copyright © 2021 Wong, Matsumura, Htoon, Tan, Tan, Ang, Wong, Agrawal, Sabanayagam and Saw.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the agreement between fluorescein angiography and structural optical coherence tomography in diagnosing and monitoring the activity of myopic choroidal neovascularization and to provide a comparative analysis with optical coherence tomography angiography. Method(s): Thirteen patients with active myopic choroidal neovascularization were prospectively enrolled. At the baseline, 2-month, and 6-month visits, each patient underwent a complete ophthalmological examination, including best-corrected visual acuity assessment, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography with structural and angiographic assessment. Sensitivity and specificity for all optical coherence tomography parameters were evaluated taking fluorescein angiography as the reference examination. Result(s): At the baseline, fluorescein angiography confirmed myopic choroidal neovascularization leakage in all patients. Structural optical coherence tomography demonstrated intraretinal or subretinal fluid in 61% of cases, fuzzy borders and absence of external limiting membrane visibility in 84% of cases, and subretinal hyperreflective exudation in 53% of cases. Sensitivity to the presence of retinal fluid and subretinal hyperreflective exudation was lower than sensitivity to fuzzy borders and external limiting membrane visibility, which reached 84%. During ranibizumab therapy, external limiting membrane visibility showed a higher sensitivity (100%) compared with fuzzy borders and subretinal hyperreflective exudation (66.6%) while displaying an equal specificity of 100%. At baseline and final visit, sensitivity increased to 100% when all structural optical coherence tomography parameters were pooled. Optical coherence tomography angiography detected myopic choroidal neovascularization at baseline, 2-month, and 6-month visits in 92%, 76%, and 76% of cases, respectively. Conclusion(s): The study confirms that the new indicators of myopic choroidal neovascularization activity are more reliable than the presence or absence of retinal fluid. Optical coherence tomography angiography identified myopic choroidal neovascularization in most patients in the diagnostic phase and during treatment monitoring and could be considered as an alternative to fluorescein angiography in selected patients.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate potential changes in myopia prevalence in Denmark by revising more than 100 years of myopia research. Method(s): A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. Only studies reporting a myopia prevalence in Denmark were included. Myopia was defined using the definition in individual references. We did not restrict inclusion of studies to specific methods of measuring or evaluating refraction. As refraction changes throughout life, information from available studies was divided in relevant age groups. Chi-squared test was used when analysing the effect of sex and education on myopia prevalence except when the expected values were beneath 5, where Fisher's exact test was used. To further compare the effect of sex, we calculated the odds ratio of being myopic for females compared to males. Result(s): We identified 29 Danish studies reporting on prevalence of myopia. The studies were performed between year 1882 and 2018. We found no strong evidence of an increase in myopia prevalence in Denmark. Increasing age was associated with an increased myopia prevalence up to the age of 60 years where after the prevalence decreased. Longer education and more intensive educational load were associated with myopia. Fourteen studies compared the prevalence of myopia between males and females and two of these studies found a significant higher prevalence in females. Conclusion(s): We evaluated nearly 140 years of myopia research in Denmark and did not find a convincing change in prevalence of myopia which is in contrast to the high prevalence of myopia reported in some parts of the world and the expected rise in myopia as predicted by WHO.Copyright © 2020 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of posterior staphyloma using wide-field optical coherence tomography (WF-OCT) in adults with high myopia in Singapore. Design(s): Population-based cross-sectional study. Method(s): Adults with spherical equivalent (SE) <= -5D in either eye at the first visit of Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study and Singapore Prospective Study Program study were recruited. Posterior staphyloma was diagnosed using WF-OCT (PLEXElite9000, Carl Zeiss Meditec). Myopic macular degeneration (MMD), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) were assessed using fundus photographs, DRI-Triton OCT (Topcon) and the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire, respectively. Factors associated with posterior staphyloma were identified with multilevel, multivariable logistic regression. Impact of posterior staphyloma on MMD, MTM and visual function was analysed with multilevel, multivariable logistic regression and linear mixed model, respectively. Result(s): Among the 225 eyes [mean SE = -6.5 +/- 2.2 D, mean axial length (AL) = 26.2 +/- 1.5 mm] of 117 participants (mean age = 60.3 +/- 7.1 years), posterior staphyloma was detected in 47 (20.9%) eyes of 38 (32.5%) participants. Older age [odds ratio (OR), 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.26], more myopic SE (0.63; 0.51-0.77) and increased AL (2.51; 1.69-3.73) were associated with higher prevalence of posterior staphyloma (all p < 0.001). Adults with posterior staphyloma had higher odds of MMD (2.67; 1.23-5.82; p = 0.013), MTM (3.79; 1.13-12.68; p = 0.031) and worse IVI Reading (beta = -1.44; -2.31 to 0.58; p = 0.001) scores. Conclusion(s): About one in three adults with high myopia had posterior staphyloma, which was associated with increased odds of having myopic maculopathy and a detrimental impact on VRQoL.Copyright © 2020 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - Importance: Systemic safety of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is a matter of debate and regular updates are necessary. Objective(s): To evaluate systemic adverse events (SAEs) associated with intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs compared with non-anti-VEGF treatments in patients with ocular diseases. Data Sources: Electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from inception to July 7, 2020. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials conducted in adults with retinal diseases who received intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Studies and treatment characteristics and outcome data were extracted and analyzed, and study quality was evaluated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were major cardiovascular events (MACEs) and total mortality. Secondary outcomes included nonocular hemorrhage, components of MACEs, other cardiovascular outcomes, serious SAEs, and all SAEs. Result(s): A total of 74 randomized clinical trials were analyzed: 32 trials (43%) included 14190 patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 24 (32%) included 5424 patients with diabetic retinopathy (diabetic macular edema or proliferative diabetic retinopathy), 17 trials (23%) included 3757 patients with retinal vein occlusion, and 1 trial (1%) included 122 patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization. Anti-VEGF drug administration did not increase MACEs compared with control agents (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% CI, 0.85-1.58) or total mortality (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.82-1.96). There was an interaction (subgroup difference, P =.04) in mortality risk depending on the underlying disease with an increase (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.03-3.16; P =.04) in the risk of death in patients with diabetic retinopathy; however, no increase was observed in patients with AMD or retinal vein occlusion. Administration of anti-VEGF drugs increased the risk of nonocular hemorrhage (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.01-2.10), mainly in patients with AMD. Conclusions and Relevance: Intravitreal anti-VEGF was not associated with an increase in MACEs in the trials examined herein. Increased mortality in patients with diabetes and nonocular hemorrhages, especially in those with AMD, could represent a safety signal, but the evidence was not strong. However, continued surveillance of SAEs remains warranted..Copyright © 2021 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - Topic: Ultra-widefield (UWF) imaging of the myopic eye. Clinical Relevance: Myopes, and particularly high and pathologic myopes, present a unique challenge in fundoscopic imaging. Critical pathology is often located in the anteriormost portion of the retina, variations in posterior segment contour are difficult to capture in two-dimensional images, and extremes in axial length make simply focusing imaging devices difficult. Method(s): We review the evolution of modalities for ophthalmic imaging (color fundus photography [CFP], optical coherence topography [OCT], angiography, artificial intelligence [AI]) to present day UWF technology and its impact on our understanding of myopia. Result(s): Advances in UWF technology address many of the challenges in fundoscopic imaging of myopes, providing new insights into the structure and function of the myopic eye. UWF CFP improves our ability to detect and document anterior peripheral pathology prevalent in approximately half of all high myopes. UWF OCT better captures the staphylomatous contour of the myopic eye, providing enhanced visualization of the vitreoretinal interface and progressive development of myopic traction maculopathy. UWF angiography highlights the posterior vortex veins, thin choriocapillaris, far peripheral avascularity, and peripheral retinal capillary microaneurysms more prevalent in the myopic eye. Researchers have demonstrated the ability of AI algorithms to predict refractive error, and great potential remains in the use of AI technology for the screening and prevention of myopic disease. Conclusion(s): We note significant progress in our ability to capture anterior pathology and improved image quality of the posterior segment of high and pathologic myopes. The next jump forward for UWF imaging will be the ability to capture a high quality ora to ora multimodal fundoscopic image in a single scan that will allow for sensitive AI-assisted screening of myopic disease.Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Background: Delayed Dark-Adapted vision Recovery (DAR) is a biomarker for Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), however its measurement is burdensome for patients and examiners. Method(s): In this study, we developed a portable, wireless and user-friendly system that employs a headset with a smartphone to deliver controlled photo-bleach and monocular pattern reversal stimuli, while using custom electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes and electronics in order to measure Dark-Adapted Visual Evoked Potentials (DAVEP) objectively and separately at the peripheral and central visual field. This is achieved in one comfortable 20-minute session, without requiring subject reporting. DAVEP responses post photo-bleach for up to 15 minutes were measured concurrently from both eyes in 12 AMD-patients, 1 degenerative myopia patient, and 8 controls who had no diagnosed macular vision loss. Result(s): Robust positive polarity DAVEP responses were observed at 200-500 ms from stimulus onset to scotopic stimuli that have been seldom reported and analyzed previously. The amplitude recovery of the DAVEP response was significantly delayed in AMD patients as compared to controls. We developed DAVEP1 scores, a simple metric for DAR, which classified 90% of subject eyes correctly, indicating the presence of AMD in at least one eye of all pre-confirmed subjects with this diagnosis. Conclusion(s): We developed a user-friendly, portable VEP system and DAVEP1 metric, which show a high potential to identify DAR-deficits in AMD-patients. This novel technol-ogy could aid in early diagnosis of AMD.Copyright © 2021 Versek et al.

N2  - Purpose: To identify prognostic factors for axial length (AL) elongation and incidence of posterior staphyloma (PS) in adult Japanese patients with high myopia. Design(s): Retrospective, observational cohort study. Method(s): Six-year follow-up data for 345 patients (620 eyes with AL >=26.5 mm and spherical equivalent [SE] <=-8.00 diopters) admitted to the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital from 2007 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Main outcome measures were change in AL from baseline, factors associated with AL, categorization of eyes with high myopia, factors associated with incidence of PS, and impact of PS on myopic maculopathy and visual function. Result(s): The mean annual increase in AL was 0.03 mm. Presence of optic nerve disc conus (P = .025), steeper corneal curvature, lower SE, and decreased choroidal thickness (CT) (all P < .001) were associated with increased AL in univariate and multivariate analyses. Younger age (P = .003) and no use of intraocular pressure-lowering medications (P = .046) were associated with increased AL. Eyes with high myopia were categorized using factor analysis as associated with glaucoma, severe pathologic myopia, and mild-to-moderate pathologic myopia. Older age, increased AL, glaucoma, and choroidal thinning (all P <= .001) were identified as significant risk factors for the incidence of PS in univariate and/or multivariate analyses. Incidence of PS was a precursor for myopic maculopathy and visual field defects. Conclusion(s): Optic nerve disc conus, steeper corneal curvature, lower SE, decreased CT, and no use of intraocular pressure-lowering medications were prognostic factors for increased AL. Older age, increased AL, glaucoma, and decreased CT were prognostic factors for PS.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate morphological differences between two types of Bruch's membrane (BM) defects-patchy atrophy (PA) and CNV-related macular atrophy (CNV-MA) Methods: Eyes presenting with PA or CNV-MA were included. Scleral thickness (ST), choroidal thickness (CT), and scleral morphological characteristics were obtained by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Fundus photographs were performed to measure the size of PA and CNV-MA lesions. Result(s): Among a total of 167 eyes evaluated, 106 eyes had PA and 61 eyes had CNV-MA. In addition, dome-shaped macula (DSM) was identified in 20 (18.87%) and 10 (16.39%) eyes among PA and CNV-MA, respectively. The eyes of CNV-MA without DSM showed a thicker subfoveal ST (278.61 +/- 56.17 vs 231.58 +/- 66.09 mm, P < 0.001), a thinner subfoveal CT, and a higher rate of scleral perforating vessels (70.6% vs 50.0%, P = 0.021) when compared with those of PA without DSM. The size of PA/CNV-MA lesions was associated with CT in eyes without DSM. However, it was only associated with bulge height in eyes with DSM (r = 0.5, P = 0.013). Conclusion(s): The eyes with CNV-MA had a thicker sclera than those with PA, which add another evidence to indicate the absence of the progressive relationship between two types of BM defects. The enlargement of lesions in BM defects between eyes with and without DSM may be caused by different mechanical forces. SS-OCT, which focuses on scleral and choroid morphology, may be necessary for more accurate classification of pathologic myopia.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - The automatic diagnosis of various retinal diseases based on fundus images is important in supporting clinical decision-making. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results in such tasks. However, their high expression ability possibly leads to overfitting. Therefore, data augmentation (DA) techniques have been proposed to prevent overfitting while enriching datasets. Recent CNN architectures with more parameters render traditional DA techniques insufficient. In this study, we proposed a new DA strategy based on multimodal fusion (DAMF) which could integrate the standard DA method, data disrupting method, data mixing method, and autoadjustment method to enhance the image data in the training dataset to create new training images. In addition, we fused the results of the classifier by voting on the basis of DAMF, which further improved the generalization ability of the model. The experimental results showed that the optimal DA mode could be matched to the image dataset through our DA strategy. We evaluated DAMF on the iChallenge-PM dataset. At last, we compared training results between 12 DAMF processed datasets and the original training dataset. Compared with the original dataset, the optimal DAMF achieved an accuracy increase of 2.85% on iChallenge-PM.Copyright © 2021 Jianfeng Cui et al.

N2  - PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the tractional elements of pathologic myopia (PM; e.g. myopic traction maculopathy [MTM], posterior staphyloma [PS], and aberrant posterior vitreous detachment [PVD]) are associated with myopic macular degeneration (MMD) independent of age and axial length, among highly myopic (HM) eyes. METHODS. One hundred twenty-nine individuals with 239 HM eyes from the Myopic and Pathologic Eyes in Singapore (MyoPES) cohort underwent ocular biometry, fundus photography, swept-source optical coherence tomography, and ocular B-scan ultrasound. Images were analyzed for PVD grade, and presence of MTM, PS, and MMD. The chi2 test was done to determine the difference in prevalence of MMD between eyes with and without PVD, PS, and MTM. Multivariate probit regression analyses were performed to ascertain the relationship between the potential predictors (PVD, PS, and MTM) and outcome variable (MMD), after accounting for possible confounders (e.g. age and axial length). Marginal effects were reported. RESULTS. Controlling for potential confounders, eyes with MTM have a 29.92 percentage point higher likelihood of having MMD (P = 0.003), and eyes with PS have a 25.72 percentage point higher likelihood of having MMD (P = 0.002). The likelihood of MMD increases by 10.61 percentage points per 1 mm increase in axial length (P < 0.001). Subanalysis revealed that eyes with incomplete PVD have a 22.54 percentage point higher likelihood of having MMD than eyes with early PVD (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS. Our study demonstrated an association between tractional (MTM, PS, and persistently incomplete PVD) and degenerative elements of PM independent of age and axial length. These data provide further insights into the pathogenesis of MMD.Copyright 2021 The Authors

N2  - The prevalence of myopia is increasing extensively worldwide. The number of people with myopia in 2020 is predicted to be 2.6 billion globally, which is expected to rise up to 4.9 billion by 2050, unless preventive actions and interventions are taken. The number of individuals with high myopia is also increasing substantially and pathological myopia is predicted to become the most common cause of irreversible vision impairment and blindness worldwide and also in Europe. These prevalence estimates indicate the importance of reducing the burden of myopia by means of myopia control interventions to prevent myopia onset and to slow down myopia progression. Due to the urgency of the situation, the European Society of Ophthalmology decided to publish this update of the current information and guidance on management of myopia. The pathogenesis and genetics of myopia are also summarized and epidemiology, risk factors, preventive and treatment options are discussed in details.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - PURPOSE. The International Myopia Institute (IMI) Yearly Digest highlights new research considered to be of importance since the publication of the first series of IMI white papers. METHODS. A literature search was conducted for articles on myopia between 2019 and mid-2020 to inform definitions and classifications, experimental models, genetics, interventions, clinical trials, and clinical management. Conference abstracts from key meetings in the same period were also considered. RESULTS. One thousand articles on myopia have been published between 2019 and mid-2020. Key advances include the use of the definition of premyopia in studies currently under way to test interventions in myopia, new definitions in the field of pathologic myopia, the role of new pharmacologic treatments in experimental models such as intraocular pressure-lowering latanoprost, a large meta-analysis of refractive error identifying 336 new genetic loci, new clinical interventions such as the defocus incorporated multisegment spectacles and combination therapy with low-dose atropine and orthokeratology (OK), normative standards in refractive error, the ethical dilemma of a placebo control group when myopia control treatments are established, reporting the physical metric of myopia reduction versus a percentage reduction, comparison of the risk of pediatric OK wear with risk of vision impairment in myopia, the justification of preventing myopic and axial length increase versus quality of life, and future vision loss. CONCLUSIONS. Large amounts of research in myopia have been published since the IMI 2019 white papers were released. The yearly digest serves to highlight the latest research and advances in myopia.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

T1  - Prediction of glaucoma medications in highly myopic patients
A1  - Hashim Z.A. 
Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Aim: To focus on the findings implicating as indicators for beginning of glaucomatous changes in young myopic. Method(s): This cohort study was carried out in Al-Diwaniyah province, mid-Euphrates region of Iraq,starting from April 2016 through June 2020. Forty five patients were enrolled in this study, a total of 78 eyes, with an age range of 4 to 20 years. The range of myopia spherical equivalent (SE) was ranging from (-6) to (-14) diopter. Patients were examined every 6 months for about 4 years and the clinical assessment included intraocular pressure (IOP), fundoscopy and visual field examination. The main objective was to make an idea about when to administer glaucoma medications to patients with high myopia when IOP measurement alone is not helping. Result(s): B-zone atrophy, rim changes and nasalization of blood vessels were significantly associated with higher degree of myopia (P < 0.05), both individually and as a whole. B-zone atrophy was significantly associated with higher degree of myopia (P < 0.05); however, neither Rim changes nor Nasalization of blood vessels were significantly associated with higher degree of myopia, despite being more frequent (P> 0.05); however, taken all together fundoscopic changes were significantly associated with higher degree of myopia (P< 0.05). Conclusion(s): It's more likely to initiate treatment in young myopes as progressive changes in the optic disc are noticed; because the patients with pathological myopia can't risk additional loss, on the other hand most of the eye examined had normal range intraocular pressure with an abnormal looking optic disc.Copyright © 2021 Lahore Medical And Dental College.

N2  - Aims To determine the prevalence and predictors of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in a consortium of Asian studies. Methods Individual-level data from 19 885 participants from four population-based studies, and 1379 highly myopic participants (defined as axial length (AL) >26.0 mm) from three clinic-based/school-based studies of the Asian Eye Epidemiology Consortium were pooled. MMD was graded from fundus photographs following the meta-analysis for pathologic myopia classification and defined as the presence of diffuse choroidal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, with or without a  plus' lesion (lacquer crack, choroidal neovascularisation or Fuchs' spot). Area under the curve (AUC) evaluation for predictors was performed for the population-based studies. Results The prevalence of MMD was 0.4%, 0.5%, 1.5% and 5.2% among Asians in rural India, Beijing, Russia and Singapore, respectively. In the population-based studies, older age (per year; OR=1.13), female (OR=2.0), spherical equivalent (SE; per negative diopter; OR=1.7), longer AL (per mm; OR=3.1) and lower education (OR=1.9) were associated with MMD after multivariable adjustment (all p<0.001). Similarly, in the clinic-based/school-based studies, older age (OR=1.07; p<0.001), female (OR=2.1; p<0.001), longer AL (OR=2.1; p<0.001) and lower education (OR=1.7; p=0.005) were associated with MMD after multivariable adjustment. SE had the highest AUC of 0.92, followed by AL (AUC=0.87). The combination of SE, age, education and gender had a marginally higher AUC (0.94). Conclusion In this pooled analysis of multiple Asian studies, older age, female, lower education, greater myopia severity and longer AL were risk factors of MMD, and myopic SE was the strongest single predictor of MMD.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

N2  - Purpose: To describe the methodology and pilot data of the Shanghai Child and Adolescent Large-scale Eye Study (SCALE-HM). Method(s): This is a population-based, prospective, examiner-masked study with annual follow-up. Patients are 4- to 18-year-olds with high myopia. The participants will fill out questionnaires and then undergo visual acuity, axial length (AL), intraocular pressure, ophthalmologist assessment, microperimetry, cycloplegic refraction, Pentacam, wavefront aberration, fundus, blood and saliva examinations. To describe the pilot data, intergroup differences were assessed with t-tests or analysis of variance and a logistic regression model was used to determine the independent factors associated with peripapillary atrophy (PPA). Result(s): Overall, 134 eyes of 79 participants met the pilot study recruitment criteria. The mean AL and spherical equivalent were 26.91 +/- 1.07 mm and -9.40 +/- 1.77 D, respectively. Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) (N = 112) and tessellated fundus (N = 67) were the most common fundus changes. The mean AL was significantly longer in PPA (27.08 +/- 0.93 mm) than in non-PPA eyes (26.06 +/- 1.31 mm; p < 0.001). Axial length (AL) (p = 0.041) was the only independent factor associated with PPA. Axial length (AL) was significantly longer in eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (N = 11; 28.02 +/- 1.31 mm) than without myopic retinal lesions (N = 56; 26.48 +/- 0.91 mm, p < 0.001) or with tessellated fundus (N = 67; 27.09 +/- 0.97 mm, p = 0.012). The myopic degree was higher in eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy than without myopic retinal lesions (-10.51 +/- 2.76 D versus -9.06 +/- 1.58 D, p = 0.039). Conclusion(s): Peripapillary atrophy and tessellated fundus were common in children and adolescents with high myopia. Results from this prospective study will help to understand the mechanisms, development and prognosis of these changes and can guide early myopia screening.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: To report a case of choroidal neovascularisation and leakage in a myopic female predicted to be a choroideraemia carrier treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF). Method(s): Case report. Result(s): A female magazine editor presented with sudden decrease in vision in her right eye, with Snellen visual acuities (VAs) of 1/60 and 3/60 in the right and left eyes respectively. She was diagnosed with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) formation and subretinal haemorrhage in her right eye. This is on a background of previous presentations, the first of which was 20 years ago for declining left eye vision. She was subsequently found to be a predicted choroideraemia carrier. However, she also has high myopia, and it is unclear whether the predicted choroideraemia carrier status or high myopia is the main underlying cause of her CNV, although we believe that the former is more likely. The first episode of CNV in her right eye was treated successfully with intravitreal anti-VEGF. However, she experienced four further CNV reactivations in her right eye, all of which were treated successfully with anti-VEGF. At her last follow-up visit to date, Snellen VAs were 6/9 and 3/60 in her right and left eye respectively. Conclusion(s): This is a unique case of CNV formation in a predicted choroideraemia carrier who also has co-existent high myopia. Prompt treatment of CNV activity with anti-VEGF has been efficacious in prevention of subretinal fibrosis and irreversible vision loss and allowed the patient to continue working in her chosen career.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - The involvement of the choroid in ocular growth regulation has been postulated in studies showing that refractive errors correlate with alterations in choroidal thickness (ChT). The advent of optical coherence tomography imaging has enabled qualitative and quantitative assessment of the choroid. In children, ChT changes correlate with a number of ocular pathologies, including myopia, retinopathy of prematurity, and amblyopia. We synthesize mechanisms and evidence regarding choroidal thickness variation during childhood. Subfoveal ChT is influenced by a number of factors including age, ethnicity, gender, axial length, and intraocular pressure. Myopic eyes have thinner choroids compared to emmetropic and hyperopic eyes. ChT may in fact serve as a marker of myopic progression, as ChT thinning occurs early during myopic development, but this association has not been established quantitatively. In addition, subfoveal ChT appears thicker in amblyopic eyes, while prematurity and retinopathy of prematurity may be associated with thinner ChT. Overall, both animal models and clinical research indicate that ChT induces or reflects physiological changes in the eye pertaining to ocular growth or maturation.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Aim: Evaluation of real-world outcomes of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy in the primary treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathological myopia. Patients and Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of treatment naive patients with myopic CNV who received treatment with either intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept over a 12-year period from September 2007 to May 2020 was performed. Baseline features, treatment factors and outcomes were compared between younger and older patients and final visual outcome was assessed for associated factors. Result(s): Thirty-seven eyes of 36 patients (24 females, 12 males) were included. Mean age was 58 years (range=26-89 years). Of these patients, 11/36 (31%) were <=50 years of age and 25/36 (69%) were >=51 years of age. Seventy-three percent (27/37) of eyes were phakic. One patient received bilateral treatment for myopic CNV. Median spherical equivalent was -8.50 diopters. Seventy percent (26/37) of eyes commenced primary treatment with ranibizumab, and 11/37 (30%) eyes commenced treatment with aflibercept. There were no significant differences between treatment factors and outcomes of younger and older patients. Median number of injections was 3 over a median follow-up period of 24.6 months. Mean CRT decreased by 126mum and median visual improvement was +6 letters. Analysis showed that younger age (p=0.022) and fewer injections (p=0.004) were associated with better visual outcomes. Conclusion(s): Myopic CNV requires less frequent anti-VEGF intravitreal therapy over a shorter follow-up period than both neovascular age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Increased frequency of administration of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment did not improve vision. Younger age is associated with a better final visual outcome. These findings may help to advise patients about the prognosis of treatment and help guide treatment decisions.Copyright © 2021 Bhatia et al.

N2  - Combining genetic and clinical data into an informative risk prediction profile has been an important ambition of personalized medicine. Single-nucleotide polymor-phisms are commonly found throughout the genome and account for the majority of interindividual genetic variation. To date, genome-wide association studies have led to the discovery of thousands of disease-associated loci, including across dozens of ophthalmic diseases and traits. However, compared with the clinical utility of identify-ing rare Mendelian variants, the translation of these results to clinical practice has so far been limited because such variants are found commonly in the population, and individ-ually account for a very small risk. Recently, combining large numbers of these genetic variants into polygenic risk scores (PRS) has shown clinically meaningful risk prediction across several common diseases. PRS have the potential to translate the discovery of common risk variants into individualized disease risk prediction, prognostication, and may enable targeted treatments. In this context, we review the clinical utility of PRS in three common, genetically complex ophthalmic conditions: primary open angle glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and myopia. Translational Relevance: Common genetic variants can be used to effectively stratify the risk of disease development and progression and may be used to guide screening, triaging, monitoring, or treatment thresholds.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - Background: Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (GA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by nyctalopia, myopia, sharply demarcated expanding peripheral chorioretinal atrophic lesions, early cataract, progressive visual loss and hyperornithinemia. Only three cases of GA associated with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD) have been reported. The genotype-phenotype correlation of RRD in GA is limited by lack of genetic information in the previously reported cases. Here we report two young sisters with a characteristic GA phenotype associated with a novel variant in the ornithine aminotransferase gene (OAT), in whom one developed unilateral RRD at the age of 9 years. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective report of two cases including genetic analysis and multimodal retinal imaging. Result(s): A 9-year-old Saudi girl presented with a funnel-shaped RRD, extensive proliferative vitreoretinopathy, peripheral choroidal detachment and neovascular glaucoma in her right eye. Fundus examination of her left eye showed an attached retina with sharply-demarcated peripheral chorioretinal atrophic patches suggestive of GA. Whole exome sequencing confirmed GA by revealing a homozygous c.980 C > G (p. Pro327Arg) variant in exon 8 of OAT. The RRD was inoperable. The chorioretinal lesions in the left eye enlarged slowly over 3 years of follow up. Examination of the proband's older sister revealed a similar but more advanced GA phenotype in both eyes. Conclusion(s): A characteristic GA phenotype associated with a novel variant in OAT is reported. This variant might be associated with childhood-onset RRD in the proband.Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Participants with high myopia, defined as <=-6 diopters spherical power, were included and followed up for 4 years, and underwent cycloplegic autorefraction, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and fundus photography examinations. Newly established DCA, enlargement of existing DCA and development of other lesions of myopic maculopathy were regarded as DCA progression. Results Of the 484 participants with a mean age of 21.5+/-12.7 years (range, 6.8-69.7 years), 68 eyes (14.0%) showed DCA progression, with 88 lesion changes. The first appearance of DCA was identified in 21 eyes (23.9%). Of 88 eyes with DCA at baseline, 47 eyes (53.4%) showed progression, with 67 lesion changes, including 45 eyes (67.2%) with enlargement of DCA, 17 (25.3%) with a first appearance of lacquer cracks, 4 (6.0%) with development of patchy chorioretinal atrophy and 1 (1.5%) with increased numbers of lacquer cracks. Longer axial length (p<0.001), baseline DCA (p=0.005) and baseline DCA closer to the fovea (p=0.013) predicted DCA progression. Eyes had poorer BCVA at the follow-up if DCA was enlarging (p<0.001) or DCA was closer to the fovea at baseline (p=0.028) after adjusting for age,gender and cataract. Conclusion Approximately half of the participants with DCA had progression over a 4-year follow-up. Enlargement and newly developed DCA were common progression patterns. Larger areas of DCA and foveal involvement with DCA could be indicators of a worse BCVA later.Copyright ©

N2  - The prevalence of myopia has markedly increased in East and Southeast Asia, and pathologic consequences of myopia, including myopic maculopathy and high myopia-associated optic neuropathy, are now some of the most common causes of irreversible blindness. Hence, strategies are warranted to reduce the prevalence of myopia and the progression to high myopia because this is the main modifiable risk factor for pathologic myopia. On the basis of published population-based and interventional studies, an important strategy to reduce the development of myopia is encouraging schoolchildren to spend more time outdoors. As compared with other measures, spending more time outdoors is the safest strategy and aligns with other existing health initiatives, such as obesity prevention, by promoting a healthier lifestyle for children and adolescents. Useful clinical measures to reduce or slow the progression of myopia include the daily application of low-dose atropine eye drops, in concentrations ranging between 0.01% and 0.05%, despite the side effects of a slightly reduced amplitude of accommodation, slight mydriasis, and risk of an allergic reaction; multifocal spectacle design; contact lenses that have power profiles that produce peripheral myopic defocus; and orthokeratology using corneal gas-permeable contact lenses that are designed to flatten the central cornea, leading to midperipheral steeping and peripheral myopic defocus, during overnight wear to eliminate daytime myopia. The risk-to-benefit ratio needs to be weighed up for the individual on the basis of their age, health, and lifestyle. The measures listed above are not mutually exclusive and are beginning to be examined in combination.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

N2  - The global burden of myopia is growing. Myopia affected nearly 30% of the world population in 2020 and this number is expected to rise to 50% by 2050. This review aims to analyze the impact of myopia on individuals and society; summarizing the evidence for recent research on the prevalence of myopia and high myopia, lifetime pathological manifestations of myopia, direct health expenditure, and indirect costs such as lost productivity and reduced quality of life (QOL). The principal trends are a rising prevalence of myopia and high myopia, with a disproportionately greater increase in the prevalence of high myopia. This forecasts a future increase in vision loss due to uncorrected myopia as well as high myopia-related complications such as myopic macular degeneration. QOL is affected for those with uncorrected myopia, high myopia, or complications of high myopia. Overall the current global cost estimates related to direct health expenditure and lost productivity are in the billions. Health expenditure is greater in adults, reflecting the added costs due to myopia-related complications. Unless the current trajectory for the rising prevalence of myopia and high myopia change, the costs will continue to grow. The past few decades have seen the emergence of several novel approaches to prevent and slow myopia. Further work is needed to understand the life-long impact of myopia on an individual and the cost-effectiveness of the various novel approaches in reducing the burden.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

N2  - Precis: Postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage (PSCH) is an infrequent but devastating complication after nonvalved aqueous drainage implant surgery and demonstrated a bimodal distribution. The final outcomes of either conservative management or surgical drainage of the hemorrhage remained poor. Purpose(s): The aim was to report the incidence and outcomes of eyes developing PSCH after undergoing Aurolab aqueous drainage implant (AADI) surgery for adult and pediatric refractory glaucomas. Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective series, case files of all patients who underwent AADI between May 2012 and December 2019 were retrieved from an electronic database. A PSCH was defined as the presence of hemorrhagic choroidal detachment, confirmed by ultrasound B scan, occurring in a closed system in the postoperative period. Result(s): Of the 986 eyes that underwent AADI during the study period, 7 (0.7%), developed PSCH (95% confidence interval=0.3-1.6%). There were no differences in the preoperative parameters between those with and without PSCH. Of these, 4 were seen in pediatric eyes (4/288, 1.4%) and 3 in adult eyes (3/698, 0.4%) (P<0.01). Four eyes (57%) had PSCH in the immediate postoperative period (ie, between 24 and 48 h of AADI surgery), while the remaining 3 had onset ranging from 6 to 7 weeks after surgery. Anatomic risk factors were present in all eyes including hypotony (n=4), myopia (n=3), microcornea (n=2), microphthalmos (n=1), postvitrectomy (n=1), and staphyloma (n=1). Visual acuity improved in only 1 (14%) eye while 3 (43%) eyes developed phthisis bulbi, all in the pediatric age group. Conclusion(s): PSCH is a rare complication following AADI and is seen in <1% eyes. The incidence is higher in the pediatric age group. Visual and anatomic outcomes are dismal following PSCH with globe salvage possible in only about half these eyes.Copyright © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: To characterize a population of high myopes with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM), to assess their retinal function, and to correlate it with anatomic status. Patients and Methods: This was an observational cross-sectional study including 50 eyes from 27 patients. Demographic and clinical data were analyzed. Macular structure was assessed with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT, Heidelberg ) and macular function was studied with Microperimeter MP-3, NIDEK . Result(s): The average for central foveal thickness (CFT) and choroid thickness (CT) was 213 +/-151 mum and 36+/-23 mum, respectively, in a total of 50 eyes from 27 patients. In the microperimetry analysis, the average sensitivity on the foveal-centered 12 polygon (CPS) was 14.37+/-9.1 dB. CT was negatively associated with the bivariate contour ellipse areas (BCEA) 1 (r=-0.314; p=0.034), 2 (r=-0.314; p=0.034), and 3 (r=-0.316; p=0.033). CPS had a strong positive correlation with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (r=0.661; p=0.000). We found a trend to worse microperimetric results in eyes with schisis (n=19) (p>0.05) but eyes with atrophic areas (n=33) presented significant inferior CPS (p<0.001). The presence of staphyloma showed significant impact on macular sensitivities in eyes with areas of macular atrophy/fibrosis (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Macular microperimetry analysis can have a role as part of a multimodal anatomo-functional assessment for a more precise characterization of the high myopic patients with MTM, optimizing medical and surgical decisions.Copyright © 2021 Baptista et al.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of posterior staphyloma (PS) types in pathological myopia (PM) with age, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), axial length (AL), andmyopic retinoschisis (MRS) using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Method(s): This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 108 eyes of 59 patients with PM from the Henan Eye Institute, China. We classified the PS types based on current international classification criteria and analyzed the risk factors (age, AL, MRS, and BCVA). Result(s): Most of the patients with bilateral PM had the same PS type (80.43%) in both eyes. Complex PS was more common in elderly patients than in younger patients (P < 0.05). Eyeswithwidemacular PS had a longer AL (P=0.012) andworse BCVA (P=0.049) than thosewith other PS types. MRSwas always comorbid with PS (93.33%), andmacular PS was the most common (82.14%). Conclusion(s): Complex PS is associated with patient age. PS is related to MRS, and these changes observed by 3D-MRI and OCT affect the prognosis of visual acuity. The 3D-MRI scans shows changes in the eye shape and PS efficiently. Translational Relevance: In patients with PM, 3D-MRI can guide the planning of posterior scleral reinforcement.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - The International Myopia Institute's (IMI) mission is to advance research, education, and management of myopia to decrease future vision impairment and blindness associated with increasing myopia. Its approach is to bring together scientists, clinicians, policymakers, government members, and educators into the field of myopia to stimulate collaboration and sharing of knowledge. The latest reports are on pathologic myopia, the impact of myopia, risk factors for myopia, accommodation and binocular vision in myopia development and progression, and the prevention of myopia and its progression. Together with the digest updating the 2019 International Myopia Institute white papers using the research published in the last 18 months, these evidence-based consensus white papers help to clarify the imperative for myopia control and the role of environmental modification initiatives, informing an evidence-based clinical approach. This guidance includes who to treat and when to start or stop treatment, and the advantages and limitations of different management approaches.Copyright © 2021 The Authors

T1  - Slowing down Myopia Progression with Contact Lenses-Everyday Cases from the Clinic
A1  - Reis A.P.R.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - Background An estimated 49.8% of the world population will be myopic by 2050. Multifocal contact lenses (MFCLs) and orthokeratology (OK) reduce peripheral retinal hyperopic defocus, which animal studies have shown to positively impact eye growth. MFCLs are expected to slow myopic progression by 20-50% and OK by 30-60%, making them valuable therapeutic tools. In view of the guidelines for myopia management published by the International Myopia Institute in 2019, the aim of this retrospective data analysis of a tertiary care center was to review past experience with OK and MFCLs for myopia control and gain information to update current practice. Patients and Methods The contact lens (CL) database of the Eye Clinic of the University Hospital of Basel was searched with the label myopia progression between January 2012-2020. Patients were included if they gave informed consent, were younger than 19 years old at baseline, and had no ocular comorbidities that could potentially compromise vision. Primary outcomes were progression of spherical equivalent refraction for MFCL patients and progression of axial length (AL) for the OK group, comparing with historical data from OK trials. Secondary outcomes were the presence of risk factors for myopia, age, refractive error at baseline, follow-up duration, and adverse effects during therapy. Results Twenty-one patients could be included, with a mean age of 12.80 +/- 3.32 years (y) at baseline. The majority of patients were older than 12 years and already myopic (-3.89 +/- 2.30 diopters) when control treatment was started. Overall, follow-up ranged from 0.08 to 6.33 years (2.03 +/- 1.66 y). In the patients treated with MFCLs, myopia control improved significantly when patients changed from spectacles to MFCLs. In the OK group, 14% dropped out during the first year and 2 patients had multiple AL measurements during therapy, which showed a slower growth of AL when compared to other OK trials and controls with spectacles. There were two cases of non-severe keratitis. Environmental risk factors had not been documented and only 48% of clinical records had a documented family risk assessment. Conclusion Patients showed a slower myopia progression under MFCLs or OK, which supports their role as a treatment option in myopia management. In this regard, AL measurement is an important additional parameter to be included in the assessment of myopia progression in clinical practice. Identification of children at risk of developing high/pathologic myopia (family history, environmental risk factors) needs to improve so that the first stages of myopic shift can be recognized and targeted. Changes in lifestyle should be actively encouraged, especially when the impact of decreases in outdoor time secondary to COVID-19 is yet to become clear.Copyright © 2021. Thieme.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of the claims'-based definition of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in detecting clinically-diagnosed AMD. Study design: A validation study using cross-sectional data. Method(s): Seven hundred clinically-diagnosed AMD patients and seven hundred non-AMD individuals were randomly selected from patients at the Kyoto University Hospital's ophthalmology outpatient clinic between January 2011 and December 2017. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative likelihood ratio of eight different claims'-based definitions of AMD for detecting clinically-diagnosed AMD. These definitions consist of the diagnosis name (AMD) in combination with (1) fluorescent fundus angiography, and/or (2) treatment of AMD, and (3) the exclusion of patients who had a diagnosis of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) or myopic choroidal neovascularization. Result(s): Defining by the diagnosis name AMD in the claims' data showed the highest accuracy (sensitivity 94.9%, specificity 92.6%, accuracy 93.7%). Combining the diagnosis name AMD with fluorescence fundus angiography and/or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti VEGF) treatment increased the specificity at the expense of sensitivity. Notably, the combination with AMD treatment achieved a specificity of 98.3%. Conclusion(s): The current validation study elucidated the high accuracy of the disease name (AMD) in the claims' data for identifying clinically-diagnosed AMD at a single university hospital. Although drawing wider conclusions may be limited, the results of this study contribute to creating real-world evidence in ophthalmology, based on the National Database of Health Insurance Claims in Japan.Copyright © 2021, Japanese Ophthalmological Society.

Y1  - 2021//
N2  - The aim of the current study was to investigate the correlation between optic disc deformation and retinal vasculature in high myopia. A total of 130 eyes with non-pathological high myopia were included in the current cross-sectional study. beta-zone parapapillary atrophy (beta-PPA), optic disc tilt ratio, and horizontal and vertical disc diameters were analyzed using fundus color photography. A 3x3 mm grid and a 4.5x4.5 mm grid were used to scan parafoveal and peripapillary regions, respectively, using optical coherence tomography angiography. Vessel flow density (VFD) and fractal dimension of the retina, as well as the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), were analyzed and quantified using en face projection images. Optic disc parameters that were associated with vascular changes were determined using multiple linear regression analysis. The results from the multivariate analysis revealed that beta-PPA was negatively correlated with the VFD of the superficial retinal plexus (R=-2.805; P=0.006), deep retinal plexus (R=-2.801; P=0.006), radial parapapillary capillaries (R=-3.936; P<0.001) and enhanced-depth imaging of the fovea (R=-2.161; P=0.034). Additionally, FAZ was not significantly correlated with any factors in the current study. Age was negatively correlated with the VFD of the retina (R=-4.234; P<0.001), while the optic tilt ratio (R=-2.291; P=0.025) was negatively correlated with three sectors in the deep layer. Overall, the present results demonstrated that optic disc deformation was negatively correlated with the retinal microvasculature in non-pathological high myopia, particularly in the radial peripapillary capillaries and the deep retinal plexus. Therefore, optic disc deformation may be used to predict the retinal vasculature in high myopia.Copyright © 2021 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose To investigate the characteristics, risk factors and visual impact of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) among adults with myopia in Singapore. Methods We analysed 3316 myopic eyes of adults aged over 40 years who participated in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases-2 study. Detailed questionnaires and ophthalmic examinations were conducted. A total of 2913 myopic eyes of 1639 subjects were graded for MTM by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. MTM is defined as the presence of retinoschisis, lamellar or full-Thickness macula hole and foveal retinal detachment. Fundus photographs were graded for myopic macular degeneration (MMD). Results Of these 2913 myopic eyes, the mean and SD of age was 60.1+/-8.0 years; the spherical equivalent (SE) was-2.5+/-2.3 D; and the axial length (AL) was 24.6+/-1.3 mm. MTM was found in 0.9% of myopic eyes and 7.3% of highly myopic eyes. In the multivariate analysis, myopic SE (p<0.001), longer AL (p<0.001), MMD (p=0.01) and epiretinal traction (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for MTM. MTM was not associated with age (p=0.38). MTM was significantly associated with poorer best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (p<0.01). Conclusions Our population-based study revealed that MTM was present in 0.9% of myopic eyes and 7.3% of highly myopic eyes. While greater myopic SE, longer AL, MMD and epiretinal traction are risk factors of MTM, age was not related to MTM. MTM has a negative effect on BCVA.Copyright © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the risk factors associated with retinal detachment recurrence after first vitrectomy in high myopic eyes with macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD). Method(s): Patients with high myopic eyes with MHRD who underwent pars plana vitrectomy and silicone oil (SO) tamponade with a follow-up period more than 12 months and more than 3 months after SO removal were included in this retrospective study. Logistic regression was performed to determine the risk factors associated with retinal re-detachment. Result(s): A total of 45 eyes from 43 patients were included in this study (11 male and 34 female patients). The retinal re-detachment rate after the first removal of silicon oil was 35.5% (16/45) in a mean postoperative follow-up time of 35.64 +/- 32.94 months. Complete macular atrophy on fundus photography (odds ratio (OR) = 17.021, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 2.218-130.609, p = 0.006) was a risk factor for MHRD after SO removal, while internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling (OR = 0.091, 95% CI: 0.013-0.633, p = 0.015) and duration of SO tamponade (OR = 0.667, 95% CI: 0.454-0.980, p = 0.039) were protective factors. Conclusion(s): For high myopic eyes with MHRD, complete macular atrophy was a significant risk factor for retinal re-detachment after silicon oil removal. ILM peeling and the duration of silicon oil tamponade were protective factors.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

N2  - Background: This study aimed to establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence-based deep learning system (DLS) for automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy. This could be important in developing an advanced tele-screening system for diabetic retinopathy. Method(s): A DLS with a convolutional neural network was developed to recognize fundus images of referable diabetic retinopathy. A total data set of 41,866 color fundus images were obtained from 17 cities in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA). Five experienced retinal specialists and 15 ophthalmologists were recruited to verify images. For training, 80% of the data set was used, and the other 20% served as the validation data set. To effectively understand the learning process, the DLS automatically superimposed a heatmap on the original image. The regions utilized by the DLS were highlighted for diagnosis. Result(s): Using the local validation data set, the DLS achieved an area under the curve of 0.9824. Based on the manual screening criteria, an operating point was set at about 0.9 sensitivity to evaluate the DLS. Specificity was recorded at 0.9609 and sensitivity was 0.9003. The DLSs showed excellent reliability, repeatability, and high efficiency. After analyzing the misclassification, it was found that 88.6% of the false-positives were mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) whereas, 81.6% of the false-negatives were intraretinal microvascular abnormalities. Conclusion(s): The DLS efficiently detected fundus images from complex sources in the real world. Incorporating DLS technology in tele-screening will advance the current screening programs to offer a cost-effective and time-efficient solution for detecting diabetic retinopathy.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.

N2  - Purpose: This study aims to determine the probability of progression of myopic maculopathy according to age. Method(s): This is a longitudinal observational study of single-center retrospective cohort of Caucasian patients formed by 212 consecutive adults with high myopia. Main outcome measures were age, visual acuity (VA), refractive error (RE), follow-up time, and the macular status assessed at least 5 years apart according to the Meta-Analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group. The progression rate was calculated based on per 1000 eyes/year. Multistate models were fitted to identify the predictive factors and to calculate the most probable age of progression onset using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. Result(s): We studied 220 eyes of 122 Caucasian patients. Mean age was 48.18 +/- 14.1, mean follow-up 12.73 +/- 5.81 years. One-hundred and fifty-two (69.1%) eyes progressed of category, and 96 (44%) worsened a mean of 0.3 logMAR units during follow-up. The progression rate was 32.21/1000 eyes/year. The probability of progressing increased with age; it was higher in women if there was a family history of myopia, worse VA, higher RE, or wide macular staphyloma. The probability of progressing from category 1 was > 0.6 after 70 years of age; from category 2, it was 0.7 after 70 years; and 0.5 from category 3 after 75 years. If choroidal neovascularization (CNV) appeared, this probability exceeded 0.7 between ages 45 and 55 for all categories. Conclusion(s): The progression rate is lower than in a Japanese series. The vision worsened with disease progression, and the probability of both happening increased after the age of 70-75. If CNV appears, the risk of progression is very high at the age of 45-55.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose: To introduce the application of intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) inpars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for various vitreoretinal diseases, and to report the 4-year assessmentof feasibility and utility in Chinese population. Method(s): Retrospective case series of patients who underwent PPV and iOCT scan at Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College from January 2016 to January 2020. Clinical characteristics were documented before operation, and we intraoperatively recorded the time and results of iOCT scanning, specific surgical maneuvers performed, the consistency with the planned strategies before surgery, the type of OCT images obtained, and adverse events (AEs).The surgeon feedback was collected to evaluate the utility of iOCT during surgery. Result(s): In total 339 eyes successfully completed iOCT scan, with an average scanning time of 3.54+/-2.3min, including 59 cases of idiopathic macular hole (iMH), 134 cases of idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM), 33 cases of lamellar macular hole (LMH), 40 cases of high myopic maculopathy, 13 cases of vitreous macular traction (VMT), 60 cases of dense vitreous hemorrhage (VH). The iOCT findings were notconsistent with examination under the operating microscope in 49 cases (14.5%), including 29 cases (8.6%) which changed the operation strategies during surgery. The Hole-door phenomenon arose in 20 cases (33.9%) of iMH and 3 cases (25%) of high myopic MH after ILMs peeling. Moreover, the residue ERM was observed in nine cases (6.7%) of iERM and two cases (14.3%) in high myopic ERM after ILMs peeling. Some new surgical methods could also be confirmed using iOCT. Conclusion(s): The application of iOCT has a significant clinical functionality in vitreoretinal surgery, providing the surgeon with a new surgical understanding, guiding the selection of a more reasonable operative procedure during surgery, predicting postoperative recovery and improving postoperative outcomes.Copyright © 2021 TheAuthor(s).

N2  - Complications from pathologic myopia (PM) are a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. However, an efficient clinical therapeutic strategy for PM is still lacking. The aim of this study was to quantitatively compare the proteomic profiles of aqueous humor between PM and non-PM cataract patients. Twenty aqueous humor samples from each group were analyzed with label-free quantitative proteomic analysis to identify the differentially expressed proteins for function enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction network construction. Hub protein was validated with ELISA using an independent cohort consisting of 20 samples from each group and its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted. A total of 583 proteins were identified and 101 proteins were found to be differentially expressed, including 63 up-regulated proteins and 38 down-regulated proteins. The bioinformatics analysis suggested that PM is closely associated with immunity and inflammation interactions, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA1) was enriched as the hub protein of the network with the highest score, degree and centrality. ROC analysis showed that ApoA1 could distinguish PM from controls with an area under the curve of 0.963 (p < 0.001). The findings could provide potential clues for further study on the molecular mechanisms and developing new treatments for PM, especially related to immunity and inflammation interactions. ApoA1 may be a potential key protein and therapeutic target in human PM. Significance: It is important and urgent to discover the mechanisms of pathologic myopia (PM) to inhibit its progression. This study applied the quantitative proteomic analysis to study aqueous humor from patients with or without PM, aiming to discover dysregulated proteins related to PM. Our results suggested that those dysregulated proteins are closely associated with immunity and inflammation interactions, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. The findings from this study could provide potential clues for further research on the molecular mechanisms and developing new treatments for PM, especially related to immunity and inflammation. ApoA1 may be a potential key protein and therapeutic target in human PM.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Purpose: To examine most postequatorial retina in eyes with myopic macular retinoschisis (MRS) by ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and to determine whether paravascular vitreal adhesions play a role in the development of MRS. Design(s): Retrospective single-center observational case series. Participant(s): One hundred fifty highly myopic participants who were older than 50 years with and without an MRS were studied. High myopia was defined as an eye with an axial length of more than 26.5 mm. Method(s): All participants underwent UWF OCT imaging with a scan width of 23 mm and a depth of 5 mm using a prototype swept-source OCT device. The vitreoretinal adhesions to the foveal retina and retinal vessels and paravascular abnormalities, including paravascular retinal cysts, paravascular retinoschisis, and paravascular lamellar holes, were analyzed in the UWF OCT images. The findings in eyes with an MRS were compared with those in eyes without an MRS. Main Outcome Measure(s): The relationships between MRS and vitreal adhesions to the retinal vessels or to the fovea were determined. Result(s): An MRS was found in 49 of the 150 eyes (33%). Vitreal adhesions to the retinal vessels were found more frequently in eyes with an MRS than in eyes without an MRS (63% vs. 44%; P = 0.04). In contrast, the number of eyes with adhesions to the fovea in eyes with an MRS was not significantly different from that in eyes without an MRS (57% vs. 59%). Paravascular lesions, for example, retinal cysts, retinoschisis, and lamellar holes, were more common in eyes with an MRS than in eyes without an MRS (71% vs. 36%, 61% vs. 17 %, and 20% vs. 8% [P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.03], respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of paravascular vitreal adhesions was a significant predictor for MRS development (odds ratio, 2.56; P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Paravascular vitreal adhesions may be related to the development of the different types of paravascular lesions including retinal cysts and retinoschisis, and play a more important role in the development of an MRS than vitreal adhesions to the fovea.Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - The purpose of this study was to detect the presence of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) based on color fundus photographs using a deep learning model. A total of 1670 color fundus photographs from the Taiwan inherited retinal degeneration project and National Taiwan University Hospital were acquired and preprocessed. The fundus photographs were labeled RP or normal and divided into training and validation datasets (n=1284) and a test dataset (n=386). Three transfer learning models based on pre-trained Inception V3, Inception Resnet V2, and Xception deep learning architectures, respectively, were developed to classify the presence of RP on fundus images. The model sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve were compared. The results from the best transfer learning model were compared with the reading results of two general ophthalmologists, one retinal specialist, and one specialist in retina and inherited retinal degenerations. A total of 935 RP and 324 normal images were used to train the models. The test dataset consisted of 193 RP and 193 normal images. Among the three transfer learning models evaluated, the Xception model had the best performance, achieving an AUROC of 96.74%. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping indicated that the contrast between the periphery and the macula on fundus photographs was an important feature in detecting RP. False-positive results were mostly obtained in cases of high myopia with highly tessellated retina, and false-negative results were mostly obtained in cases of unclear media, such as cataract, that led to a decrease in the contrast between the peripheral retina and the macula. Our model demonstrated the highest accuracy of 96.00%, which was comparable with the average results of 81.50%, of the other four ophthalmologists. Moreover, the accuracy was obtained at the same level of sensitivity (95.71%), as compared to an inherited retinal disease specialist. RP is an important disease, but its early and precise diagnosis is challenging. We developed and evaluated a transfer-learning-based model to detect RP from color fundus photographs. The results of this study validate the utility of deep learning in automating the identification of RP from fundus photographs.Copyright © 2021. Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

N2  - Objective: To characterize the multimodal retinal findings of myopic macular pits, a feature of myopic degeneration. Method(s): A case series of patients with myopic macular pits were studied with multimodal imaging including color fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), near infrared reflectance (NIR), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICG). Result(s): Nine eyes of 6 patients with myopic macular pit were examined. Four patients presented with multiple pits and 3 with bilateral involvement. All pits were localized in a region of severe macular chorioretinal atrophy associated with myopic posterior staphyloma. In 3 eyes, the entrance of the posterior ciliary artery through the sclera was noted at the base of the pit. Schisis overlying the pit or adjacent to the pit was identified in 3 patients. Conclusion(s): Myopic macular pits are an additional rare sign of myopic degeneration, developing in regions of posterior staphyloma complicated by severe chorioretinal atrophy and thin sclera.Copyright © 2021 Canadian Ophthalmological Society

N2  - Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is a non-invasive imaging modality for assessing the vasculature within ocular structures including the retina, macula, choroid and optic nerve. OCT-A has a wide range of clinical applications in various optometric conditions which have been independently reported in the literature. This paper aims to present a review of the current literature on the clinical application of OCT-A in optometric practice as well as to analyse and evaluate the quality of the available evidence. This review included 78 articles from a literature search conducted on 26 May 2019 across the following databases: Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science. Primary ocular pathologies discussed in this review include glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, myopia, acquired and congenital macular dystrophies, epiretinal membrane, retinal vein occlusion, retinitis pigmentosa, choroidal melanoma, uveitis, central serous chorioretinopathy, amblyopia and optic neuropathies. Primary outcome variables included vessel density, foveal avascular zone area and diameter, flow velocity and flow index. This review aims to evaluate the evidence available for OCT-A applications in diagnosis and prognosis of ocular conditions in an optometric setting.

N2  - Purpose To assess the incidence, clinical features and predictive risk factors of subretinal fibrosis after treatment of active myopic choroidal neovascularisation (mCNV) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Methods This post-hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial included a total of 54 patients with active mCNV. The clinical data at baseline, month 3 and month 12 were used. Fundus photography and optical coherence tomography at month 3 were used to determine the presence of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy, and its incidence was calculated. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Visual Function Questionnaire-25 score, macular integrity index (MI) and their changes were compared between eyes with and without subretinal fibrosis. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the risk factors of subretinal fibrosis. Results Subretinal fibrosis occurred in 22 of 54 eyes with mCNV. Patients with subretinal fibrosis achieved similar BCVA improvement in comparison with those without fibrosis at 3 and 12 months after the treatment; however, they had lower visual acuity, more subfoveal CNV (p=0.002), higher CNV thickness at baseline (p=0.016), larger CNV size (p=0.030), larger leakage area (p=0.021) and higher presence of advanced myopic maculopathy (p=0.035). Age <45 years, BCVA <60 ETDRS letters, and MI index <20 at baseline were the predictors for subretinal fibrosis occurrence in a logistic regression model. Conclusions The incidence of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy was 40.7% in eyes with mCNV. Age, baseline BCVA and MI index could serve as predictive risk factors of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF treatment in patients with mCNV.Copyright ©

N2  - Introduction: Hereditary motor sensory neuropathy type VIA with optic atrophy (HMSN6A) is a rare variant subtype of mitofusion 2 (MFN2) associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, with ophthalmic manifestations largely limited to optic atrophy. We report a case series of four individuals with HMSN6A with known variants in the MFN2 gene. The series highlights two sisters that demonstrated this phenotype, but also manifested pathologic myopia and other ocular abnormalities. Method(s): The clinical presentation of these index siblings and other affected family members are reviewed. We also performed a systematic review of the literature to identify previous reports of HMSN6A and detailed the clinical manifestations and ocular findings in such cases. Result(s): HMSN6A is a neurologic disorder characterized by a motor sensory axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy. Additional ophthalmic manifestations have not been well characterized in the literature. We highlight two sisters with a personal and family history of HMSN6A that demonstrate the wide range, of clinical sequalae and symptom severity associated with HMSN6A. In addition to optic atrophy, both sisters also possessed ophthalmic features of bilateral pathologic myopia, limited vision, nystagmus, and strabismus. Conclusion/relevance: This case series and review helps to elucidate the ophthalmologic findings of HMSN6A and provides incentive to further investigate the phenotype.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Introduction: Previously reported outer retinal changes in children with glaucoma have been attributed to uveitis or prior intraocular surgery. Here we identify and characterize novel macular abnormalities seen on mounted optical coherence tomography (OCT) in childhood glaucoma patients, including those without a history of uveitis or major surgical intervention. Method(s): Childhood glaucoma patients undergoing examination under anesthesia and/or surgical intervention who were unable to be imaged with standard tabletop OCT due to young age, limited cooperation, or technical factors, were imaged with mounted OCT under general anesthesia. Macular scans were reviewed by two masked graders for vitreous, retinal, and choroidal abnormalities. Result(s): A total of 104 of 70 subjects with childhood glaucoma (mean age, 5.5 +/- 5.7 years; range, 0.17-24.5) were imaged. Abnormal macular findings, present in 68 of 104 scans (65.4%), included inner retinal thinning (29), foveal hypoplasia (13), staphyloma and/or myopic changes (11), inner nuclear cysts (10), outer retinal changes (8), epiretinal membrane (6), retinal thickening or edema (5), fovea plana (4), and preretinal tissue (1). Choroidal findings included thin choroid (15) and choroidal mass (7). Retinal and choroidal abnormalities were attributable to glaucoma (55 [50%]), nonglaucoma (53 [48.2%]), and combined (2 [1.8%]) etiologies. Twenty-three of 110 (20.9%) abnormalities were unexpected based on the primary diagnoses and clinical context. Conclusion/relevance: Mounted OCT allowed identification of expected and unexpected macular abnormalities, some of which have not been reported in association with childhood glaucoma. OCT-identified macular pathology in childhood glaucoma aids study of pathophysiology, and may affect visual prognosis and management of these patients.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Purpose : To investigate the prevalence and potential associations of dome-shape macular configuration in general population. Methods : A total of 65440 subjects with a mean age (+/- standard deviation, SD) of 57.3 +/- 8.11 years with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) data from a unique contemporary resource for the study of health and disease that recruited more than half a million people in the UK (UK Biobank) was analyzed in this study. A deep learning model was used to segment the RPE, and the macular curvature of the OCT scan was calculated by polynomial fit. The curvature was evaluated and associations with refractive error (spherical equivalent), corneal curvature, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, age, sex, ethnicity, fluid intelligence, birth weight, maternal smoking were examined. Results : The overall macular curvature values followed a gaussian distribution with a mean (+/- SD) of 0.0021 +/- 0.0014. There was a high inter-eye agreement. While all factors but 'sex' were significantly associated with the curvature in a multilinear analysis (adjusted R , 0.122), the highest correlation could be found for the factors refractive error and ethnicity. The prevalence of a macular dome-shape configuration was overall 4.78%, most common in Chinese subjects as well as hypermetropic eyes. An increasing frequency was found towards extreme refractive error (hypermetropia and myopia). Extreme domeshape configuration (defined by the fourth quartile of concave curvature values), however, was more frequently found in myopic eyes; in particular in eyes with high (spherical equivalent, <-6 diopters) and extreme (spherical equivalent, <-9 diopters) myopia with a frequency of 3.76% and 6.49%, respectively. The odds ratio for this particular macular configuration in individuals of Chinese ethnicity for high and extreme myopia was 4.83 and 7.91, respectively. Conclusions : Dome-shape macular configuration can be found in general population, more commonly in eyes with high refractive error. Further investigation of determinants of this macular configuration might provide new insights into normal eye development and maldevelopment like staphyloma.

N2  - Purpose : Despite growing literature looking at factors that contribute to the closure of full-thickness macular holes, there are still gaps in our knowledge. This study sought to examine the role of preoperative and intraoperative factors in predicting anatomic and visual success of vitrectomy for full-thickness macular holes. Methods : A retrospective chart review of cases in calendar 2019 was conducted at the University of Wisconsin. Inclusion criteria included vitrectomy for macular hole and preand post-operative imaging. Successful closure was defined as the absence of a full-thickness disruption by imaging. Data was summarized using the median and inter quartile range (IQR; span from 25 to 75 percentile capturing central 50% of the sample) for continuous features or with frequencies and percentages for categorical factors. Risk factors associated with hole closure were compared between groups using either ranksum procedures or Fisher's exact tests. Odds ratios and supporting 95 confidence intervals (CI ) were computed for categorical factors by inverting Fisher's exact test or using logistic regression with Firth's correction in cases where the explanatory factor had more than two levels and data especially sparse. Analyses were performed using R (ver. 4.0.3). Results : There were 64 subjects who met inclusion criteria and had vitrectomy for macular hole (Table 1). One had a traumatic injury and was especially young (< 15 years old) at the time of repair; all others were between 48.8-87.4 years at time of surgery. Internal limiting membrane was peeled in all cases (1 in a prior surgery). Hole closure was successful for 57 subjects (89%); 55 (86%) had single surgery success. Age, lens status, prior hole repair, and chronicity (present > 1 year) were not associated with the outcome (p > 0.10 for each). Pathologic myopia or staphyloma (n=8, 12.5%) was associated with lower odds of success (OR=0.14; CI : 0.02-0.86, p = 0.036). Median minimum hole diameter (MHD) was 335.2 uM. Larger MHD was greater among those who had an unsuccessful repair, but not significantly (p = 0.071). Data suggest an estimated 71% (CI : 42-100%) chance a subject with an unsuccessful outcome would have a larger MHD. Conclusions : The study suggests that the factors that portend a decreased likelihood of a successful macular hole surgery include pathologic myopia/staphyloma and larger MHD.

N2  - Purpose : To evaluate the short and long-term efficacy of Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) intravitreal therapy with a Pro Re Nata (PRN) approach in the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and to investigate the correlation of basal risk factors with treatment outcomes, in order to individualize treatment. Methods : Observational, retrospective study of 91 patients (28 men and 63 women) treated with Anti-VEGF therapy due to neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia for a 1 to 6 years period. Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) and Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) before and after treatment were analyzed. The mean number of injections in the first year, and during the whole treatment period was assessed. Additionally, prognostic factors for Anti-VEGF treatment were identified such as age, baseline visual acuity, localization and anatomic features of CNV studied by OCT, as well as treatment considerations. Results : Mean (SD) age at onset was 67.9 (14.4) years. The BCVA (logMAR) improved from 0.72 at baseline to 0.53 one month after the first injection, it remained stable in 0.53 after three months. BCVA after 6 years was 0.58 (p< 0.05 in all cases). A reduction of 47.96mum (p< 0.05) in CRT was observed in OCT three months after treatment. The mean number of injections during the first year was 3.05, and 3.65 for the complete follow-up period. BCVA improved 3 lines in young patients, compared to 1 line in patients over 60 years (p= 0.115). One month after treatment, BCVA in subfoveal CNV changed from 0.85 to 0.66 (p< 0.05), whereas in yuxtafoveal CNV it improved from 0.58 to 0.39 (p< 0.05). Type 2 CNV demonstrated a better response to treatment (from 0.71 to 0.56) than type 1 CNV (from 0.75 to 0.62), p< 0.05. Conclusions : Anti-VEGF therapy has demonstrated efficacy in the short and long-term with a significant improvement in BCVA and in CRT. The PRN regimen or as needed is appropriate and includes a more individualized treatment approach. Advanced age, poor baseline visual acuity and subfoveal localization worsen prognosis. However, further studies are needed in order to identify which patients would benefit from a more intensive therapy in the long term.

N2  - Purpose : Long term outcomes and risk of reactivation of myopic choroidal neovascularisation (mCNV) are poorly understood. This study describes the treatment patterns, risk of reactivation and visual outcomes over ten years in a large cohort of patients. Methods : Treatment-naive eyes receiving at least one intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections for mCNV were included in the study. Data were generated during routine clinical care) between 09/2008 and 12/2018 utilising Medisoft Electronic Patient Record (EPR) data from 27 NHS sites in the UK. Main outcome measures included visual acuity (VA), number of injections, number of reactivations and number of visits. Reactivations were defined as between 95 to 97.5 centile of distribution of injection interval in this study cohort. Results : A total of 385 eyes of 380 patients receiving 1,822 injections were included. The mean age was 61.7 years old and the Female:Male was 2.25:1. Loess regression of Visual Acuity (VA) vs times 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months was 61, 64, 66, 66, 64, 61,and 59 (letters) . The end of an mCNV activity reactivation was determined to be 12 weeks (just below 97.5 centile of distribution of injection interval in this study cohort). The mean number of injections was 3.12 injections during their first reactivation episode, which reduces to 2.04, 2.27, 2.36, 1.95, and 1.6 at their 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th reactivation episode, respectively. Conclusions : Our findings show that in the first four years of treatment, the VA is shown to have improved. However, past the fourth year, the VA steadily reduces. The data guides the temporal definition of the end of an mCNV reactivation and the number of treatments and the likelihood of further reactivations of disease activity occurring. These data will guide the counselling of patients and follow up intervals scheduling.

N2  - Purpose : To investigate the five-year cumulative incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy in the general population in Germany and to analyze potential risk factors. Methods : The Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) is a population-based cohort study, including 15,010 participants aged 35 to 74 years at baseline. Myopic maculopathy incidence and progression was assessed by grading of fundus photographs according to a recent international photographic classification system (META-PM), in phakic eyes with spherical equivalent <=-6D (baseline). 509 eyes of 334 participants (mean age 50.4 +/- 9.2 years; median:-7.25D myopic refractive error) without myopic maculopathy at baseline and 34 eyes of 27 subjects (mean age 56.7 +/- 9.1 years; median-9D myopic refractive error) with myopic maculopathy met the conditions and had gradable fundus photographs at baseline and five-year follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for progression of myopic maculopathy. Results : 5-year cumulative incidence of myopic maculopathy was 0.3% (95%CI: 0.02-1.92%; n=1). Progression occurred in 17 of 34 eyes (50%) with prior myopic maculopathy over 5 years with 4 changes in category. The most common types of progression were enlargement of chorioretinal and patchy atrophy; a new pathology was present in 8 eyes. Higher IOP (OR=1.62, 95%CI: 1.03-2.53, p=0.035) was associated with progression of myopia, while female gender (OR=5.54, 95%CI: 0.93-32.92, p=0.060) and higher myopic refractive error (OR=1.62 per diopter, 95%CI: 0.99-1.49, p=0.063) showed a tendency towards progression. Conclusions : Incidence of myopic maculopathy is rare in highly myopic eyes in the general population in Germany at age 35 to 74 years. Progression of eyes with myopic maculopathy in the German population occurred in 50% of prior diseased highly myopic eyes. These population-based five-year follow-up data on incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy are the first in Europe.

N2  - Purpose : In recent years, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) has improved our understanding of microvascular changes in myopic macular degeneration. We performed a prospective cross-sectional study using widefield swept-source OCTA (WF SS-OCTA) to assess retinal microvasculature and choroidal thickness in myopia. Methods : Patients with high myopia (HM; Spherical Equivalent (SE) <=-6D or axial length >=26.5mm), mild/moderate myopia (MM; -6D<SE<=-1D), and age-matched healthy subjects were imaged with PLEX Elite 9000 (Zeiss) using 3x3mm, 6x6mm, and 12x12mm scans centered on the fovea. Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) perimeter, area, and circularity, as well as vessel skeleton density (VSD), vessel density (VD), and choroidal thickness (CT) of entire retina, superficial, and deep slabs were analyzed using the ARI Network (Zeiss Portal). Results : 186 eyes were analyzed; these eyes were categorized as 75 with HM, 43 with MM, and 68 age-matched controls. HM was associated with increased FAZ perimeter in 6x6 and 12x12 scans (P<.05, Table) and decreased circularity in all scans (P<.002, Table). HM and MM were associated with decreased VSD and VD in all slabs (P<.03, Table). Furthermore, HM was associated with a decrease in every ETDRS subfield, with a larger decrease temporally in 12x12 scans (beta =-13.21, beta =-0.40, P<.001). HM was associated with decreased CT in all scan sizes (P<.03, Table). Changes in CT were unevenly distributed, with thinning most evident in the region between central fovea and optic disc and superior nasal subfields (P<.02, Figure C). Conclusions : We identified decreased vessel density associated with myopia using WF SSOCTA in a large, comprehensive cohort at a single center. We also observed regional differences including a greater decrease in VSD and VD in the temporal quadrant and uneven reductions in CT. Further work may help identify risk factors for the progression of pathologic myopia and other vision threatening complications.

N2  - Purpose : To diagnose and segment choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a real-world multi-center clinical optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) dataset. Methods : In this study, a total of 10125 OCTA scans from 2497 eyes, including 4260 CNV scans and 5865 non-CNV scans, were collected from 5 eye clinics. Selected scans included 3x3-mm and 6x6-mm macular scans. All scans were included regardless of image quality. CNV scans were collected from multiple diseases, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), pathological myopia, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and other rare retinal diseases. The non-CNV dataset consisted of a heterogenous group including heathy controls, non-neovascular AMD, diabetic retinopathy, branch retinal vein/artery occlusion, and central serous chorioretinopathy. Two experts (JW and KT) graded projection resolved OCTA images and manually delineated CNV membrane area using both en face of outer retina and cross-sectional OCTA images. Multiple representations of both en face and volumetric OCT&OCTA were fed into a custom designed hybrid multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) that produces a CNV diagnosis and membrane segmentation. 5-fold cross-validation was applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results : For CNV diagnosis, the sensitivities were 96% and 91% on 3x3-mm and 6x6-mm scans with 95% specificity, respectively. Of all scans with CNV, 2% of CNV scans were incorrect due to segmentation error preventing CNV detection. Of low quality scans (n=993) with a signal strength less than 50, CNV was correctly detected 97.3% of the time. The method was able to accurately diagnose CNV and segment CNV membranes on both 3x3-mm and 6x6-mm in neovascular AMD (Fig.1) and also showed reliable performance on challenging scans in other retinal disease, e.g. PCV, and myopia CNV(Fig.2). Conclusions : The proposed method can accurately diagnose and segment CNV in a realworld clinical dataset. These results could enable automated CNV screening and quantification in clinic and lead to improved artificial intelligence-aided CNV diagnosis.

N2  - Purpose : Artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis of retinal diseases using a single imaging method of color fundus photography (FP) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been fully investigated. Although bi-modal imaging examinations using both FP and OCT could provide more comprehensive retinal information than their single-modal counterparts, which might improve the accuracy of AI to detect retinal diseases, the feasibility and performance of bimodal imaging-based AI diagnosis of retinal diseases have not been extensively investigated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a bi-modal imaging-based AI system in detecting multiple retinal diseases using both FP and OCT images. Methods : The AI-based system was trained using 573 scans (from 400 patients) centered on macula, validated using 192 scans (from 140 patients), and tested using 209 scans (from another 146 patients). Each scan that captured with Topcon 3D OCT-1 Maestro (Topcon Corp., Japan) consists of one FP and one corresponding radial OCT scan, which further consists of 12 OCT B-scans. Using both images and additional summarized clinical data, at least two ophthalmologists confirmed the diagnosis of each scan, including diabetic retinopathy (DR), dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), wet AMD, epiretinal membrane (ERM), pathologic myopia (PM), macular oedema (ME), and normal (Fig 1). Performance of this system was measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and average precision (AP) per diagnosis. Results : The bi-modal image-based AI system had a mean AP for the detection of multiple retinal diseases of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 - 0.87), a sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93), and a specificity of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.88-0.95) (Fig 2). Compared with the bimodal image-based AI system, the mean AP was 0.74 when the AI system was trained with only FP images (95% CI 0.69-0.78), and 0.81 when with only OCT images (95% CI, 0.77-0.84) (Fig 2). Conclusions : AI-assisted diagnostic system based on bi-modal imaging method showed significantly better performance than that based on FP, and relatively better performance than that based on OCT. The additional information provided by bi-modal imaging method could be used for not only diagnosis, but also perhaps therapeutic decision, which needs further study.

N2  - Purpose : We have developed a bi-modal artificial intelligence(AI) system with deep learning algorithms to comprehensively identify pathological retinal features based on optical coherence tomography(OCT) and fundus photography(FP). Here, we designed a prospective experiment to validate its real-world clinical performance at a district hospital. Methods : The AI system can identify 14 pathological and anomalous features from OCT(including drusen, macular hole and so on) and 12 pathological and anomalous features from FP(including diabetic retinopathy, pathological myopia and so on). To evaluate the performance of AI and the value of the system in clinical assistant diagnosis, we deployed the system to the Baoshan Branch of Shanghai Renji Hospital for a threemonth(from August 2020 to October 2020) clinical validation. Topcon Maestro 3D OCT-1 in Radial scanning mode was used for data capturing which can obtain 12 radial 6mm macular OCT images and a 45-degree FP of the macula in a single acquisition. A total of 667 eyes from 363 patients(Female 186, 51.2%; Mean age 54.3, SD 11.0) where both OCT and FP were good quality were included in this validation. The OCT and FP reports generated by AI were independently reviewed by a senior ophthalmologist. The reviewer's judgement was considered as the gold standard. Results : Table 1 shows the AI performance of OCT and FP on 667 eyes. For the 14 OCT features, the average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 97.2%, 98.7% and 98.6%, and for the 12 FP features were 94.9%, 99.2% and 98.9%, respectively. Since both OCT and corresponding FP were collected, different, complementary features in OCT and FP were found when judging retinopathy. There were 292 (43.7%) abnormal eyes recognized by OCT, 354(53.0%) by FP and 439(65.8%) by combining OCT and FP(Figure 1). Conclusions : We examined the AI performance for detecting pathological and anomalous features in OCT and FP. For the features validated, AI performance can meet the requirements for community screening applications and primary hospital auxiliary diagnostic scenarios. Furthermore, the combination of OCT and FP can significantly improve the disease recognition performance of AI, because of the complementary information in simultaneously acquired OCT and FP.

N2  - Purpose : To assess the systemic associations of angioid streaks (AS) using a large U.S. healthcare database. Methods : This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of all patients diagnosed with AS, identified by ICD9 and ICD10 coding, in a large, national U.S. insurer from 2000 -2019. All patients were 18 years or older and had at least one active year of enrollment within the plan. Any patient with a diagnosis of choroidal rupture or pathologic myopia were excluded. The literature was reviewed for all published associations with AS, as well as those in the standard mnemonic for AS (PEPSI). The rates of each disease state in those with AS were then calculated.Results : After applying exclusion criteria, 2,072 patients were eligible for the study. The mean and standard deviation of age for this group is 63.4 (18.5) years, respectively, with 817 (39.4%) males and 1,255 (60.6%) females. The number of patients and rates of association between AS and the well characterized conditions of the PEPSI mnemonic are as follows: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) -258 patients (12.5%), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome -21 patients (1.0%), Paget's disease -7 patients (0.3%), hemoglobinopathies (i.e. sickle cell disease) -33 patients (1.6%), and idiopathic, the largest group -1,756 patients (84.7%). To enumerate the less commonly described but previously reported diseases associated with AS, 514 patients (24.8%) were diagnosed with diabetes, 319 patients (15.4%) familial adenomatous polyposis, 222 patients (10.7%) had lead poisoning, 524 (25.3%) had senile elastosis, and 697 (33.6%) had non-exudative AMD. Conclusions : AS, pathologically characterized as breaks in Bruch's membrane, has a known significant association with PXE. Concurrently, the association of AS with other less reported diseases lends support to a new mnemonic and new mechanistic understanding of AS formation.

N2  - Purpose : The neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration has been reported to be less frequent among individuals self-identifying as Black, suggesting that darker fundus pigmentation due to increased concentration of melanin within uveal melanocytes may affect retinal abnormalities. Whether this association is found in other retinal conditions, such as pathologic myopia (PM), has not been evaluated to our knowledge. Therefore, we investigated retinal characteristics of PM among patients who self-identified as Black. Methods : Retrospective review of medical records was performed of adult patients who self-identified as Black with ICD codes consistent with PM followed by retina specialists at the Retina Division, Department of Ophthalmology, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD. For a comparison group, a similar review was done for only one of the retina specialists, among patients with PM who did not self-identify as Black. Data collection included central subfield thickness (CST) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) based on the most recently obtained OCT between January 2005 and December 2019. Results : Among 7 retina specialists, 428 patients were ICD coded for PM and 60 of those patients (14%) self-identified as Black. In comparison, 2,026 (22%) of all 10,012 patients seen in the Retina Division self-identified as Black in 2014. of the 368 patients who did not self-identify as Black, 63 patients from a single retina specialist were used as a comparison group. OCT images were available for 35 (58%) of the 60 black patients and 46 (73%) of the 63 patients in the comparison group. Mean (+/- SD) CST in the right eye was 260 +/- 77 mum in the Black patients and 296 +/- 98 mum in the comparison group, while median (25 , 75 quartiles) CST in the right eye was 259 mum (218, 280) in black patients and 281 mum (256, 319) in the comparison group. Conclusions : While the retrospective design and multiple confounding factors that can affect CST-such as retinal detachment, choroidal neovascularization, or retinal atrophy- preclude formal statistical analyses, these preliminary investigations suggest there may be differences in CST among patients with PM who self-identify as Black and those who do not. A prospective cross-sectional study is planned to characterize PM in these patient populations in greater detail.

N2  - Purpose : Although infrequent, reoperations for recurrent or persistent full thickness macular holes have been shown to have a lower success rate based on anatomic and functional outcomes. The optimal approach to these recurrent or persistent macular hole cases who have already undergone removal of the posterior hyaloid and primary ILM removal remains under active investigation. Given the variety of surgical approaches utilized around the world, there is a need for a relatively large series to demonstrate realworld visual compared to anatomic outcomes after surgery for recurrent macular holes alone. Based on the multitude of published and successful surgical techniques, a direct comparison of approaches was undertaken. Methods : Clinical charts of all patients who underwent recurrent macular hole surgery between 2010 and 2020 were reviewed to identify appropriate patients. Operative notes were reviewed for secondary vitrectomy procedures and the surgical technique was recorded. Particular attention was paid to phakic status and whether the internal limiting membrane was removed at the time of primary macular hole repair. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was obtained at 3 months and 6 months post operatively. OCT measurements were reviewed to obtain average macular hole thickness. Eyes were excluded who carried a diagnosis of pathologic myopia (spherical equivalent greater than -8), central retinal vein occlusion, or a history of ocular trauma. All eyes in whom a macula hole was identified along with a retinal detachment were excluded for concurrent cases. Results : 29 patients were identified to have undergone surgery for recurrent macular hole with complete followup. Patient demographics included a mean age 66.3+/-17. 16 patients received ILM flap, 4 patients underwent macular amniotic membrane graft, 2 macular redetachment, 7 use of silicone oil tamponade, and 5 a combination of these techniques. Mean BCVA at baseline was 20/125 and remained at 20/125 equivalent at 3 months. At 6 months the vision had declined to 20/160. The closure rate with all techniques was 81.8% after repeat surgery. Conclusions : Although anatomic success was achieved in the majority of cases, visual improvement did not always correlate. Additional work is needed to identify better vision salvaging techniques in surgery for recurrent or persistent macular holes.

N2  - Purpose : Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a frequent and sight-threatening complication in high myopia. The anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is the current standard of treatment in newly diagnosed myopic CNV. However, after exudation is resolved, patients may experience recurrences that were demonstrated to significantly impact the long-term visual outcomes. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship of demographics, clinical characteristics and structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings to disease recurrence in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed myopic CNV. Methods : In this IRB-approved retrospective analysis, we collected data from 64 participants (64 eyes) with successfully treated myopic CNV who had obtained resolution of exudation after treatment (study baseline) and with 3 years of regular follow-ups. At baseline, several OCT qualitative features and quantitative measurements were graded by two readers and included in the analysis. Main outcome measures included incidence of disease recurrence and hazard ratio (HR) for demographics, clinical characteristics and OCT risk factors. Results : At month 36, 40 eyes (62.5%) developed disease recurrence (active CNV). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that final visual acuity (at 36 months-dependent variable) was associated with visual acuity at baseline visit (p<0.0001), baseline size of patchy atrophy (p=0.010), baseline subfoveal choroidal thickness (p=0.008), baseline maximum CNV height and width (p=0.011 and p=0.003), and recurrence of CNV exudation (p=0.007). The following factors were associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence: size of patchy atrophy had an HR of 1.14 (95% CI, 1.01-1.29; p=0.036); maximum CNV width had an HR of 1.02 (95% CI, 1.01-1.04; p<0.0001). Conclusions : We identified OCT risk factors for the disease recurrence in eyes with successfully treated myopic CNV. Assuming that disease recurrence is a sight-threatening event, our findings may help in the identification of high-risk patients and eventually ameliorate their outcome.

N2  - Purpose : Myopic macular degeneration (MMD) is rapidly increasing in prevalence worldwide, and severe forms can cause irreversible loss of vision. Recent studies have shown an association between decreased choroidal thickness and increased grade of MMD. Our cross-sectional study aimed to further characterize this choroidal thinning by analyzing choriocapillaris alterations in MMD. Methods : We recruited controls (n=51 eyes) and high myopes (spherical equivalent <= -6 diopters; n=16 eyes) from clinic at the University of California San Francisco. Axial length (AL) from A-scan, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundus photos, and swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) were measured. Fundus photos were graded for stage of MMD by 2 independent ophthalmologists. Inclusion criteria for subjects were those with Grade 2 MMD (diffuse chorioretinal atrophy) and high axial myopia (AL >= 26.5 millimeters [mm]). Subjects without MMD, with ages from 19-88 years old (mean=56) and AL from 21.65 to 25.84mm (mean=23.87), were used as controls. Exclusion criterion was BCVA worse than 20/40. 3x3mm SS-OCTA scans were acquired and choriocapillaris (CC) mean thickness was measured by identifying CC peaks in OCTA A-scan intensity profiles. CC flow void percent (CC FV%) was quantified using a fuzzy C-mean thresholding method on enface OCT-A images of an 8-um CC slab below Bruch's membrane. Multivariate regression models were analyzed comparing CC thickness and CC FV% between subjects and controls, with a linear correction for age. Results : Subjects with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy had both a significantly decreased CC thickness and increased CC FV% compared to controls. CC thickness in subjects with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy measured 5.23 +/- 0.68 um (mean +/- standard deviation) versus 15.45 +/- 1.82 um in controls (p<0.001). CC FV% in subjects with diffuse MMD measured 26.5 +/- 0.04 versus 11.6 +/- 0.04 in controls (p<0.001). Conclusions : Patients with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy and good visual acuity had a 66% reduction in CC thickness and a 230% increase in CC FV% compared to controls. Although these patients have essentially normal BCVA and outer retinal landmarks on optical coherence tomography, they demonstrate significant choriocapillaris alterations that are consistent with reduced perfusion to the outer retina. These results point to a potential vascular etiology for MMD.

N2  - Purpose : Recent studies have suggested the superior diagnostic ability of swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT), versus spectral-domain OCT (SDOCT), in localizing glaucomatous defects in eyes with low to moderate myopia. Here, we compare SSOCT and SDOCT retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) measurements in highly myopic (HM) eyes, to determine if the difference in SSOCT and SDOCT RNFL (diffRNFL) is correlated with axial length (AL). Methods : 43 eyes from 34 HM patients (AL 28.0+/-1.6, 24.0 to 31.6mm) were scanned with SSOCT (PLEX Elite) and SDOCT (Cirrus). RNFL was measured and segmented into 4 quadrants and 12 clock-hour segments. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between diffRNFL and potential baseline predictor variables (AL, age, gender, laterality, lens status, glaucoma diagnosis [GLC], myopic macular degeneration [MMD] severity, peripapillary atrophy [PPA] severity, disc tilt severity, and presence of intrachoroidal cavitation [ICC]). Results : In univariate regression analysis, AL was significantly associated with diffRNFL in the inferior quadrant (beta=13.50mum, p<0.001), but not in the overall mean, nasal, superior or temporal quadrants (all p>0.05). After adjusting for potential confounding variables (MMD, tilt, ICC, GLC and PPA), multivariate analysis demonstrated that every 1mm increase in AL was associated with a 9.33mum increase in inferior quadrant diffRNFL (p=0.03). When holding potential confounders (including AL) constant, there was a 12.29mum greater inferior quadrant diffRNFL per unit increase in PPA severity (p=0.046). In multivariate analysis of SDOCT RNFL values, after adjusting for potential confounders (MMD, tilt, ICC, GLC and PPA), every 1mm increase in AL was associated with a 7.47mum decrease in inferior quadrant RNFL (p=0.001). In contrast, multivariate analysis of SSOCT RNFL, after adjusting for potential confounders (MMD, tilt, ICC, GLC and PPA), showed that inferior quadrant RNFL was not significantly associated with AL (p=0.64). Conclusions : The difference in SSOCT and SDOCT measurements of inferior quadrant RNFL was shown to increase with longer AL. Moreover, inferior quadrant RNFL was unaffected by AL on SSOCT, but decreased with longer AL on SDOCT. Taken together, this suggests SSOCT may provide more robust RNFL measurements in HM eyes in which there is suspicion for myopic glaucoma.

N2  - Introduction: The systemic safety of intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs is still a matter of debate and needs to be regularly updated. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated systemic adverse events (SAEs) associated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) compared to non-anti-VEGF controls in randomized controlled trials. Material(s) and Method(s): Electronic searches were conducted in MedLine, Embase, and Cochrane central register of controlled trials databases. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019129864). Main outcomes were major cardiovascular events (MACE) and total mortality. Secondary outcomes included non-ocular hemorrhage, cardiovascular (CV) mortality, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, stroke, venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), arterial hypertension, proteinuria, all serious SAEs and all SAEs. Peto odds ratios (OR) fixed effect model was used to pool the data. Result(s): We included 66 RCTs: 28 (42%) included 13,358 neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) patients, 24 (36%) included 6,080 diabetic retinopathy patients,13 (20%) included 2,680 retinal vein occlusion patients, and one study (2%) included 122 patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization. Anti-VEGF did not significantly increase MACE compared to control (OR 1.23 [0.93-1.62], p = 0.15) but marginally increased total mortality (OR 1.43 [0.99-2.06], p = 0.06). Increased mortality was mainly apparent in diabetic patients (OR 1.84 [1.20, 2.83]) possibly due to an increase in cardiovascular deaths (OR 1.74 [1.01, 2.99]). Anti-VEGF significantly increased the risk of non-ocular hemorrhage (OR 1.51 [1.04, 2.19], p = 0.03) mainly in nAMD patients. Other secondary outcomes were not significantly increased by anti-VEGF. Discussion/Conclusion: Intravitreal anti-VEGF were not associated with significant increase in MACE, but increased mortality in diabetic patients and non-ocular hemorrhages in older nAMD patients could represent a safety signal. Surveillance of SAEs in high-risk diabetic and very old patients under intravitreal anti-VEGF drugs should be continued.

N2  - Purpose: Myopia management seeks to slow ocular growth to reduce the risks of myopia-associated pathological ocular changes, but few eyecare practitioners have routine access to dedicated biometry instrumentation. This study explored the estimation of ocular axial length from measures of keratometry and refraction. Method(s): For a large prospective study into the performance of a dual focus one-day soft contact lens (MiSight 1 day, CooperVision, Inc), 144 subjects (8-12 years) without previous contact lens wear were fitted with either a dual focus or a standard soft contact lens and followed for three years. Radius of curvature of the anterior cornea (k, mm) and axial length (A, mm) were determined with an IOL Master biometer (Carl Zeiss Meditec) and cycloplegic and non-cycloplegic spherical equivalent refractive error (S, D) was evaluated with a WAM-5500 (Grand Seiko). A linear mixed model was constructed to evaluate the potential for calculating 1/A from 1/k and S. Result(s): The model found that 1/A could be predicted with the formula: 1/A = (0.22273/k) + (0.00070*S) + 0.01368 with both 1/k (F = 1636, p < 0.0001) and S (F = 1334, p < 0.0001) as significant factors. The coefficient of determination, r-squared, was 0.83. Reorganisation of this equation gives: A = 1/(0. 01368 + 0.00070 S + 0.22273/k) with 95% confidence limits of +/- 0.73 mm (+/- 3.0%). A similar relationship was found with non-cycloplegic refraction. Conclusion(s): For eyecare practitioners wishing to estimate absolute ocular axial length of their patients, using keratometry and refractive error provides better agreement to a biometer than employing refractive error alone. This approach is able to categorise patients into risk groups based on the overall level of myopia but is not as precise as using a dedicated biometer for assessing small changes in axial length over time.Copyright © 2021

N2  - Purpose: To report long-term outcomes of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in Caucasians. Method(s): Medical records of 98 eyes of 89 Caucasian mCNV high myopic patients (SE <= - 6D or axial length (AL) >26.5 mm) were analysed. All patients received IVB injections and had at least 24 months of follow-up. BCVA, number of injections and recurrences were primary outcomes. Result(s): Mean follow-up was 80.5 +/- 37.3 months. Mean baseline BCVA was 0.58 +/- 0.46 LogMar and BCVA significantly improved after treatment to 0.33 +/- 0.32 LogMar (p < 0.001). Mean BCVA gain was 0.18 +/- 0.46, 0.15 +/- 0.51 and 0.13 +/- 0.47, respectively, 12, 24 and 26 months after the first injection. At 48 months, the BCVA improvement (0.03 +/- 0.49) was no longer statistically significant (p = 0.6). Age, baseline BCVA and followup duration were significant predictors for final BCVA (R2 = 0.284, p < 0.001). The median number of injections was 2 (IQR 1 to 4) during the first episode. Total number of injections during follow-up was significantly correlated to age (r = 0.32, p = 0.001), AL (r = -0.30, p = 0.045) and final BCVA (r = 0.26, p = 0.009). Recurrences occurred in 55 eyes (56%) after an average of 41 months and did not significantly affect the final BCVA (0.64 +/- 0.57 versus 0.53 +/- 0.61, p = 0.4). Conclusion(s): IVB treatment in Caucasian mCNV patients significantly increases the BCVA, however visual improvement only lasted for 36 months. Recurrences occur frequently, but do not affect the final BCVA.

N2  - PURPOSE: A trend that myopia is becoming gradually more common is shown in studies worldwide. Highest frequencies have been found in East Asian urban populations (96.5%) but also a study in Europe shows that nearly half of the 25-29 year olds has myopia. With the increase in prevalence, high myopia, i.e. a spherical equivalent of -6 or more and an axial length of 26 mm or more is also on the rise. High myopia particularly carries a significant risk of ocular pathology related to the long axial length. This highlights the need for myopia management in children with progressive myopia, in particular progression to high myopia. RECENT FINDINGS: During the last decade, many intervention studies for myopia progression have emerged. Although lifestyle adjustments are effective, pharmacological and optical interventions have shown the highest efficacy on reduction of eye growth. High concentration atropine (0.5%-1.0%) shows the most reduction in axial length progression, but has drawbacks of light sensitivity and loss of accommodation. Nevertheless, when these side effects are mitigated by multifocal photochromatic glasses, the long-term adherence to high dose atropine is high. Lower concentrations of atropine are less effective, but have less side effects. Studies on optical interventions have reported reduction of progression for Ortho-K and multifocal contact lenses, but are in need for replication in larger studies with longer duration. SUMMARY: The field of myopia management is rapidly evolving, and a position on the best approach for daily clinics is desirable. Over the last 10 years, our team of clinical researchers has developed a strategy which involves decision-making based on age, axial length, position on the axial length growth chart, progression rate, risk of high myopia, risk profile based on lifestyle and familial risk, side effects, and individual preference. This personalised approach ensures the most optimal long-term myopia control, and helps fight against visual impairment and blindness in the next generations of elderly.Copyright © 2020 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics © 2020 The College of Optometrists.

N2  - PURPOSE: To analyze the repeatability of manual measurement of foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area in an optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) image in high myopia. METHOD(S): This study comprised patients with high myopia and controls. Two consecutive FAZ areas of the superficial and deep capillary plexus were obtained using OCTA. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) were assessed, and univariate and multivariate generalized linear mixed models were conducted to identify factors related to repeatability. RESULT(S): Thirty eyes with high myopia and 34 eyes of healthy subjects were included in the study. The mean age in high myopia and control subjects was 55.5 and 60.8 years, respectively, the mean spherical equivalent was -9.98 and -0.55 diopters, and the mean axial length was 28.0 and 23.9 mm. The ICCs of FAZ area of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) were 0.891 and 0.919, while the CVs were 8.8% and 8.5%. In measurement of the deep capillary plexus, the ICCs were 0.788 and 0.907, while the CVs were 11.2% and 11.0%, which were acceptable but exhibited lower repeatability than those of SCP. Multivariate analyses showed that older age (p = 0.030) and greater axial length (p = 0.005) were significantly associated with lower repeatability of SCP FAZ area measurements. In addition, greater axial length (p = 0.044) was a significant factor for lower repeatability of deep capillary plexus FAZ area measurements. CONCLUSION(S): Manual measurement of FAZ area using OCTA exhibited relatively good repeatability for high myopia. Age and axial length affected repeatability and should be considered when analyzing FAZ areas in high myopia patients.Copyright © 2020 The Korean Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate prognostic factors related to the surgical outcome of vitrectomy in myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). METHOD(S): Medical records of patients with MTM who underwent pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling and follow-up over 12 months were reviewed retrospectively. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundoscopic examination and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography findings were evaluated postoperatively. Functional success was defined as visual acuity gain and anatomical success was defined as reduction or resolution of foveoschisis without complications. RESULT(S): This study included 40 eyes of 36 patients. BCVA improved from 0.70 +/- 0.44 to 0.63 +/- 0.57 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution and central macular thickness decreased from 526.6 +/- 132.1 to 277.8 +/- 92.1 mum at final follow-up. Functional success was achieved in 24 (60.0%) eyes, and 33 (82.5%) eyes reached anatomical success. Presence of foveal detachment (FD) and higher category of myopic maculopathy were associated with both functional (p = 0.014, 0.021, respectively) and anatomical (p = 0.011, 0.022, respectively) failure. Longer preoperative axial length showed an association with functional failure but not with anatomical failure (p = 0.041). In multivariate analysis, FD was the only prognostic factor for both functional and anatomical outcome (p = 0.041, 0.043, respectively). Preoperative BCVA (r2 = 0.259, p = 0.001), axial length (r2 = 0.172, p = 0.008), and myopic maculopathy category (r2 = 0.336, p < 0.001) showed significant correlation with final BCVA. CONCLUSION(S): More severe myopic maculopathy and the presence of FD are associated with poorer functional and anatomical outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy in MTM. Better preoperative BCVA, shorter axial length, and less severe myopic maculopathy are correlated with better final BCVA.Copyright © 2020 The Korean Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of autologous retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid transplantation (RPE-choroid patch) for exudative and atrophic maculopathies. METHOD(S): Consecutive chart review of 120 eyes, which underwent RPE-choroid patch, from 2007 to 2017 for RPE atrophy or choroidal neovascular membrane secondary to exudative and hemorrhagic age-related macular degeneration, myopia, angioid streaks, and laser. Eyes were tested with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), reading ability, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography, autofluorescence, and microperimetry. RESULT(S): Eighty-eight eyes of 84 patients had complete data, with 2- to 10-year follow-up. Mean age was 71.9 +/- 9.06 years. Mean preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/320 (1.2 +/- 0.2 logMAR) and 20/200 (0.94 +/- 0.36 logMAR), respectively (P = 0.009). Reading ability recovered in 43% of cases. Microperimetry showed central fixation. A gain of at least 15 letters was obtained in 40% of eyes. Integrity (P = 0.009) of external limiting membrane and higher preoperative BCVA (P = 0.001) predicted better final BCVA. Complications were retinal detachment (11.4%), macular atrophy (7%), subretinal hemorrhage (4.5%), epiretinal membrane (4.5%), recurrent choroidal neovascular membrane (4.5%), macular hole (3.4%), and cystoid edema (3%). CONCLUSION(S): Autologous RPE-choroid patch achieved long-lasting BCVA improvement and central fixation, in eyes with choroidal neovascular membrane and intact external limiting membrane. Atrophic maculopathies only obtained temporary visual benefit.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) in terms of safety, refractive outcomes, visual quality, and biomechanical responses in correcting myopia with maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10 diopters (D). SETTING: Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, comparative study. METHOD(S): The study comprised 60 eyes (60 patients) with a maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10 D; 30 eyes were corrected using SMILE and 30 eyes were corrected using FS-LASIK. Patients received preoperative and 6-month postoperative examinations, including refractive outcomes, corneal curve, contrast sensitivity, ocular aberrometry, and corneal biomechanical responses. RESULT(S): At 6 months postoperatively, the uncorrected distance visual acuity was -0.01 +/- 0.06 and -0.05 +/- 0.10 in the SMILE and LASIK eyes, respectively (P = .08). The corrected distance visual acuity was -0.07 +/- 0.07 and -0.08 +/- 0.08 (P = .624), respectively. The postoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -0.20 +/- 0.25 D and -0.03 +/- 0.20 D, respectively (P = .008). The posterior corneal curvature was unchanged after SMILE and FS-LASIK (P > .05). The measured corneal thickness was reduced by 137.40 +/- 15.01 mum and 155.06 +/- 17.43 mum (P < .001). The change in the SE was -0.01 +/- 0.26 and -0.13 +/- 0.30 from 1 week (P = .103). Only the peak distance (the distance between the highest points of the nondeformed corneal parts) differed between the groups (1.06 +/- 1.44 mm vs -0.26 +/- 1.16 mm, P = .007). In the SMILE patients, changes in higher-order aberration (P = .018) and spherical aberration (P = .011) were smaller than in LASIK patients. CONCLUSION(S): Compared with LASIK, SMILE might offer superior safety and objective visual quality, comparable stability and efficacy, and a little inferior predictability in correcting maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10 D.

N2  - This report describes development of spherical equivalent refraction (SER) and axial length (AL) in two population-based cohorts of white, European children. Predictive factors for myopic growth were explored. Participants were aged 6-7- (n=390) and 12-13-years (n=657) at baseline. SER and AL were assessed at baseline and 3, 6 and 9 years prospectively. Between 6 and 16 years: latent growth mixture modelling identified four SER classes (Persistent Emmetropes-PEMM, Persistent Moderate Hyperopes-PMHYP, Persistent High Hyperopes-PHHYP and Emerging Myopes-EMYO) as optimal to characterise refractive progression and two classes to characterise AL. Between 12 and 22-years: five SER classes (PHHYP, PMHYP, PEMM, Low Progressing Myopes-LPMYO and High Progressing Myopes-HPMYO) and four AL classes were identified. EMYO had significantly longer baseline AL (>=23.19 mm) (OR 2.5, CI 1.05-5.97) and at least one myopic parent (OR 6.28, CI 1.01-38.93). More myopic SER at 6-7 years (<=+0.19D) signalled risk for earlier myopia onset by 10-years in comparison to baseline SER of those who became myopic by 13 or 16 years (p<=0.02). SER and AL progressed more slowly in myopes aged 12-22-years (-0.16D, 0.15 mm) compared to 6-16-years (-0.41D, 0.30 mm). These growth trajectories and risk criteria allow prediction of abnormal myopigenic growth and constitute an important resource for developing and testing anti-myopia interventions.

N2  - The visual outcome of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy varies among individuals. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 24 eyes (24 patients) with treatment-naive myopic CNV who underwent anti-VEGF monotherapy following a pro-re-nata regimen at the Division of Medical Retina Clinic, Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University Hospital between May 2014 and December 2017. The mean age was 70.6 +/- 2.1 years, and 16 (66.7%) patients were female. Overall, the mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved (p = 0.034), and the mean height of the hyperreflective material (HRM), involving the CNV lesion recorded by optical coherence tomography, decreased (p < 0.01) 12 months after the initial treatment. Fifteen eyes (62.5%) achieved a BCVA of better than 0.10 in LogMAR at 12 months; they had a better BCVA (p = 0.015) and lower HRM intensity (p = 0.033) at baseline than the others. Remarkably, the BCVA improved (p < 0.05) and the HRM height (p < 0.01) decreased only in eyes with a final BCVA better than 0.10 as early as 1 month after the initial treatment, which was still present at 12 months. The HRM height and intensity, not only the BCVA, would be valuable in evaluating the prognosis of myopic CNV after anti-VEGF therapy, although further study is required.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Background: Currently, whether and when intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medication should be used in glaucoma suspects with high myopia (GSHM) remains unknown. Glaucoma suspects are visual field (VF) defects that cannot be explained by myopic macular changes or other retinal and neurologic conditions. Glaucoma progression is defined by VF deterioration. Here we describe the rationale, design, and methodology of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to evaluate the effects of medically lowering IOP in GSHM (GSHM study). Method(s): The GSHM study is an open-label, single-center, RCT for GSHM. Overall, 264 newly diagnosed participants, aged 35 to 65 years, will be recruited at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, between 2020 and 2021. Participants will be randomly divided into two arms at a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention arm will receive IOP-lowering medication, while participants in the control arm will be followed up without treatment for 36 months or until they reach the end point. Only one eye per participant will be eligible for the study. If both eyes are eligible, the eye with the worse VF will be recruited. The primary outcome is the incidence of glaucoma suspect progression by VF testing over 36 months. The secondary outcomes include the incidence of changes in the optic nerve head morphology including the retinal nerve fiber layer, and retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer loss, progression of myopic maculopathy, visual function loss, and change in the quality of life. Statistical analyses will include baseline characteristics comparison between the intervention and control groups using a two-sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test; generalized linear models with Poisson regression for the primary outcome; Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test for the incidence of the secondary outcome; and longitudinal analyses to assess trends in outcomes across time. Discussion(s): To the best of our knowledge, the GSHM study is the first RCT to investigate the impact of medically lowering IOP in GSHM. The results will have implications for the clinical management of GSHM. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04296916. Registered on 4 March 2020Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose. To evaluate the prevalence and causes of visual impairment in a group of community people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Northeast China. Methods. Population-based cross-sectional survey. Patients diagnosed with T2DM residing in 15 communities in Fushun, Northeast China, were enrolled between July 2012 and May 2013. All participants underwent an extensive and standardized eye examination (visual acuity testing, slit-lamp, and fundus examination). Low vision was defined as presenting VA of better-seeing eye <20/60 and >=20/400, and blindness was defined as VA <20/400, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definitions. The primary causes of blindness and low vision were assessed by senior ophthalmologists. Results. Visual acuity measurements were available for 1998 (89.8%) of 2224 subjects in the study. The prevalence of bilateral blindness and low vision defined was 0.90% and 10.81%. Uncorrected refractive error was the first leading cause of low vision (75.0%) and blindness (38.9%). After correcting the refractive error, the first leading cause of low vision was cataract (44.4%), followed by diabetic retinopathy (29.6%) and myopic maculopathy (18.5%), while the first leading cause of blindness was proliferative DR (45.4%), followed by cataract (36.4%) and myopic maculopathy (18.2%). Conclusions. This study suggested a high prevalence of low vision and blindness in this study cohort. Uncorrected refractive error and cataract remain the leading cause of visual impairment, but the major challenge is the early diagnosis and intervention of diabetic retinopathy to reduce diabetes-related blindness.Copyright © 2020 Liang Wen et al.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the morphologic features and identify the risk factors of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Method(s): Eighty-eight eyes of 69 consecutive patients with myopic CNV were included in this study. About 109 eyes of 78 pathologic myopia patients without myopic CNV were randomly selected as the control group. Morphologic features and parameters including scleral thickness (ST), choroidal thickness (CT), posterior staphyloma height and the presence of scleral perforating vessels were obtained and measured by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for myopic CNV. Result(s): Patients with myopic CNV had relatively shorter axial length (P < 0.001) and thicker sclera (P < 0.001) compared to those without. After adjusting age, gender and axial length, thick sclera (OR = 1.333, P < 0.001 per 10-mum increase) and thin choroid (OR = 0.509, P < 0.001 per 10-mum increase) were associated with the presence of myopic CNV. Scleral perforating vessels were detected in the area of myopic CNV in 78.67% of the subjects. Conclusion(s): A relatively thicker sclera and a thinner choroid are the biological indicators for myopic CNV on SS-OCT. Scleral perforating vessels may also play a pivotal role in the formation of myopic CNV.© Copyright © 2020 Xie, Chen, Yu, Zhou, He, Wang, Fan and Xu.

N2  - Introduction Myopic maculopathy and glaucoma belong to the most common causes of irreversible blindness worldwide and, having an ocular axial elongation as one of their main risk factors, can occur together. The detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) in highly myopic eyes is clinically and technically difficult, and there is no information available, neither about the natural course of GON or about the course of GON under intraocular pressure-lowering therapy. We therefore designed this study to explore the natural course of GON in highly myopic eyes. Methods and analysis In this single-centred longitudinal registry cohort study, 813 highly myopic individuals will be recruited and undergo detailed ophthalmic examinations. High myopia is defined by a myopic refractive error of >=-6 D or an axial length of >=26.5 mm. GON is defined by a glaucomatous appearance of the optic nerve head or glaucomatous visual field (VF) defects. GON progression is defined by either change of the optic disc or VF. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the ethical committee of the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC), Sun Yat-sen University, China (ID: 2019KYPJ079). All the participants are required to provide informed consents. Results will be disseminated through scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. The data will be deposited at the clinical research centre in ZOC using electronic data capture system, and a copy of paper files will also be kept. Only members of the project team will have access to these data. Trial registration number NCT04302220.Copyright © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To provide the surgical indication for patients with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) by investigating the postoperative outcomes after vitrectomy among different types of morphological characteristic groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that included patients (37 eyes) diagnosed with MTM at a single institution. All 37 eyes from 37 patients with MTMs were classified into three groups: foveal retinoschisis (FS), lamellar macular hole (LMH), and foveal retinal detachment (FRD). The ratios of anatomic recovery, central retinal thickness (CRT), and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were statistically analyzed among the three groups preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after vitrectomy. RESULT(S): Anatomical recovery could be found in all patients of the FS group at 6 months postoperatively and in the LMH group at 12 months postoperatively. Only 83.33% patients in the FRD group showed anatomic recovery until 12 months. The time taken for CRT to reduce to 200 microm was gradually increased between the FS, LMH, and FRD groups. Postoperative BCVA was better in the FS group than the LMH and FRD groups (P <.05), but the LMH and FDR groups had no difference (P >=.05) at any point. The visual acuity was significantly improved in the FS group (P <.01) and FRD group (P =.018), but not in the LMH group (P =.196) at 12 months postoperatively. CONCLUSION(S): The FS group achieved anatomical recovery in the shortest time and had the best postoperative BCVA. FRD patients could get visual gain but need too much time for the anatomical recovery. LMH patients experienced anatomic success with surgery, but not in BCVA. Early surgery might be considered for eyes at FS prior to the occurrence of LMH or FRD.Copyright © 2020 Slack Incorporated. All rights reserved.

N2  - Myopia, also known as short-sightedness or near-sightedness, is a very common condition that typically starts in childhood. Severe forms of myopia (pathologic myopia) are associated with a risk of other associated ophthalmic problems. This disorder affects all populations and is reaching epidemic proportions in East Asia, although there are differences in prevalence between countries. Myopia is caused by both environmental and genetic risk factors. A range of myopia management and control strategies are available that can treat this condition, but it is clear that understanding the factors involved in delaying myopia onset and slowing its progression will be key to reducing the rapid rise in its global prevalence. To achieve this goal, improved data collection using wearable technology, in combination with collection and assessment of data on demographic, genetic and environmental risk factors and with artificial intelligence are needed. Improved public health strategies focusing on early detection or prevention combined with additional effective therapeutic interventions to limit myopia progression are also needed.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

N2  - Background: The efficacy of vision screening for adults has not been well established. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of vision-threatening ocular diseases, including glaucoma, among subjects who participated in specific health checkups in Japan. Method(s): This cross-sectional study included 1360 individuals who underwent comprehen-sive ophthalmic examinations at 16 ophthalmology clinics located in three municipalities. We surveyed the study participants using a questionnaire. The participants also underwent visual acuity and refraction tests, intraocular pressure tests, slit-lamp microscopy, fundus examinations, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and static perimetry. Result(s): The mean age of the subjects was 63.7 +/- 8.7 years (range, 40-74 years). Among the 1360 participants, 168 (12.4%) were diagnosed with glaucoma and 33 (2.4%) with preperimetric glaucoma. Cataracts were seen in 741 participants (54.5%), and 77 (5.7%) were diagnosed with clinically significant cataracts. Retinal diseases included macular degeneration (1.2%), diabetic retinopathy (1.0%), chorioretinal atrophy (0.5%), macular epiretinal membrane (2.9%), branch retinal vein occlusion (0.7%), and others (2.0%). Regarding the type of glaucoma, 93.5% of participants with glaucoma were diagnosed with open-angle glaucoma in a broad sense (81.0% with normal-tension glaucoma and 12.5% with primary open-angle glaucoma). Multivariate analysis showed that male sex, age, systemic comorbidities, and myopia were significant risk factors for open-angle glaucoma. Conclusion(s): Many adults with ocular diseases were screened by ophthalmic checkups. The addition of simultaneous ophthalmic checkups to specific health checkups could be an effective measure for the prevention of visual impairment in the older population.Copyright © 2020 Yamada et al.

N2  - PURPOSE: To validate the recently developed ATN grading system for myopic maculopathy to classify eyes with pathologic myopia. METHOD(S): Cross-sectional study. A series of consecutive eyes diagnosed with pathologic myopia and signs of myopic maculopathy (grade >=1 for atrophic, tractional, or neovascular components of the ATN), with a refractive error > -6.0 diopters (D), were included. All patients underwent complete ophthalmological examination including fundus photography and swept-source optical coherence tomography. Six observers graded each eye twice using the ATN system (>=15 days between assessments) based only on the aforementioned data. RESULT(S): Sixty eyes from 47 patients (61.7% female) were graded. Mean patient age was 63.2 +/- 11.7 years. The mean spherical equivalent was -13.8 +/- 6.5 D. Mean axial length was 28.6 +/- 2.16 mm. Overall, the mean intraobserver agreement (%) for the same image was 92.0%, and the mean interobserver agreement for the second image was 77.5%. The weighted Fleiss k showed excellent correlation (k > 0.8) for the traction and neovascularization components and good correlation (0.75) for atrophy. Interobserver agreement for each of these three components was 95.2%, 98.4%, 95.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Application of the ATN resulted in high intraobserver and interobserver correlation, underscoring the reproducibility of the system.

T1  - Retinoschisis: splitting hairs on retinal splitting
A1  - Carr E.R. 
Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Retinoschisis can be found in the fovea or the retinal periphery, either of which may be present in isolation, or in conjunction with each other. Foveal schisis may be congenital, acquired, or secondary to an associated ocular pathology such as optic pit, glaucoma, or pathological myopia. The visual acuity is dependent on the cause of the schisis and appropriate treatment is variable based on likelihood for progression and visual impact. There are many useful considerations and tools for evaluation and monitoring that can be used to determine the aetiology and prognosis of these retinal findings. Retinoschisis is a diagnosis of exclusion, and pathology must be ruled out to accurately make the diagnosis. A review of two cases and following discussion summarises the various types, manifestations, presentations, and complications of retinoschisis and their evaluation, management, and appropriate monitoring or treatment. These cases lead a dialogue on the presentation and aetiology of retinoschisis, important considerations for differential diagnoses, and appropriate management.Copyright © 2019 Optometry Australia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To quantify the defocus characteristics in the near-work environment at home and investigate the relationship with subsequent myopia progression. METHOD(S): Fifty subjects (aged 7-12 years) were recruited and followed for 1 year. The home near-work environment (writing desk) was measured at a baseline home-visit using the Kinect-for-Windows to capture a 3-dimensional image. The depth values of the image were then converted into scene defocus with respect to the subject's viewpoint. The defocus characteristics were quantified as the dioptric volume (the total amount of net defocus, or DV) and standard deviation of the defocus values (SDD ). Information on home size, time spent outdoors, and in front of a desk were also obtained. Univariate correlation, and multivariate regression were used to assess the association between myopia progression, defocus characteristics, and other co-variates. RESULT(S): The baseline spherical equivalent refraction (M) and refraction change over 1 year (M) were - 1.51 +/- 2.02 D and - 0.56 +/- 0.45 D respectively. DV was not significantly correlated with M (Spearman's rho = -0.25, p = 0.08), while SDD was negatively correlated to M (Spearman's rho = -0.42, p = 0.003). Although SDD was not a significant predictor in multivariate analysis, the regional DV at 15degree-20degree eccentricity was significant (p = 0.001). Home size (F2,50 = 7.01, p = 0.002) and time spent outdoors (Independent t = -2.13, p = 0.04) were also associated with M, but not time spent in front of desk (Independent t = 0.78, p = 0.44). CONCLUSION(S): The defocus profile in the home environment within the para-central field of view is associated with childhood refractive error development.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - PURPOSE: To reveal clinical features of patchy atrophy in pathologic myopia and investigate the status of the Bruch membrane and retinal pigment epithelium by swept-source optical coherence tomography. METHOD(S): This study reviewed highly myopic patients who visited the high myopia clinic between January 2015 and February 2018. Wide-field photographs and wide-field fundus autofluorescence fundus images were used as the primary method for identifying PAs, and swept-source optical coherence tomography images were used for investigating the retinochoroid status of PAs. RESULT(S): Four hundred fifty-six PAs were detected in 137 eyes (118 patients). Patchy atrophys were located most often in the macular area (28.3%), followed by the inferior (25.9%), temporal (18.9%), nasal (14.5%), and superior (12.5%) region. All 210, PAs which had been fully or partially scanned by swept-source optical coherence tomography, showed a retinal pigment epithelium defect, and 174 (82.9%) PAs showed a Bruch membrane defect on the available scans. In 101 (82.8%) of 122 PAs with clearly detectable borders of the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch membrane defect, the Bruch membrane defects were smaller than the retinal pigment epithelium defects. A dome-shape inward bulging of the sclera was observed in 10 PAs. CONCLUSION(S): These morphological findings may provide a basis for exploring the biomechanical etiology of the PAs as part of the development of pathologic myopia.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the preservation of round optic nerve head (ONH) shape in myopic eyes of surgically treated congenital glaucoma patients, with regard to factors associated with intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation-induced peripapillary scleral (PPS) deformation. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) on the ONH and macula, we identified myopic eyes with round ONH and internally oblique border tissue and those with non-round ONH. We investigated differences in clinical factors between the two groups. We included 51 eyes of 34 patients. Age at first surgery (2.8 vs. 15.2 months, P<0.001) was significantly different between the two groups. Axial length was also significantly longer (P=0.004) in the non-round group, but multiple logistic regression analysis revealed age as the only significant factor (P<0.05) in ONH roundness. Interestingly, the round ONH group also had non-curved fundus morphology and a thick choroid, while the non-round ONH group showed diverse degrees of disc tilt and posterior pole curvature, and a thin choroid. In conclusion, in eyes with congenital glaucoma, age at first surgery, particularly when older than 6 months, was associated with round ONH and emmetropia-like fundus despite high myopia. The findings may indicate two different changes in the posterior sclera and the neural canal in response to the increased IOP.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Due to high prevalence myopia has gained importance in epidemiological studies. Children with early onset are at particular risk of complications associated with myopia, as progression over time might result in high myopia and myopic macular degeneration. Both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the increasing prevalence of myopia. The aim of this study is to review the current literature on epidemiology and risk factors for myopia in school children (aged 6-19years) around the world. MAIN BODY: PubMed and Medline were searched for the following keywords: prevalence, incidence, myopia, refractive error, risk factors, children and visual impairment. English language articles published between Jan 2013 and Mar 2019 were included in the study. Studies were critically reviewed for study methodology and robustness of data. Eighty studies were included in this literature review. Myopia prevalence remains higher in Asia (60%) compared with Europe (40%) using cycloplegic refraction examinations. Studies reporting on non-cycloplegic measurements show exceptionally high myopia prevalence rates in school children in East Asia (73%), and high rates in North America (42%). Low prevalence under 10% was described in African and South American children. In recent studies, risk factors for myopia in schoolchildren included low outdoor time and near work, dim light exposure, the use of LED lamps for homework, low sleeping hours, reading distance less than 25cm and living in an urban environment. CONCLUSION(S): Low levels of outdoor activity and near work are well-established risk factors for myopia; this review provides evidence on additional environmental risk factors. New epidemiological studies should be carried out on implementation of public health strategies to tackle and avoid myopia. As the myopia prevalence rates in non-cycloplegic studies are overestimated, we recommend considering only cycloplegic measurements.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors associated with myopia and high myopia in children in South Korea. METHOD(S): A total of 983 children 5-18years of age who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2016-2017 (KNHANES VII), a nationwide population-based cross-sectional study, were evaluated. Myopia and high myopia were defined as a spherical equivalent (SE)<=-0.5 diopters (D) and SE<=--6.0 D. The association between refractive errors and potential risk factors for myopia was analyzed. RESULT(S): The prevalence of myopia and high myopia was 65.4 and 6.9%, respectively. Older age and parental myopia were significantly associated with both myopia and high myopia, while higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with high myopia only. Although the proportion of subjects who spent more time on near work activities (>=4h/day) was sequentially increased with increased refractive error, this tendency was not statistically significant by multivariable logistic regression. CONCLUSION(S): Korean children had a high prevalence of myopia and high myopia. In this age group, the risk of myopia increased with aging and parental myopia. Higher BMI may be associated with high myopia.

N2  - RATIONALE: To report a rare case of phacoemulsification cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation that improved visual acuity and capsular stability in a patient with pathologic myopia and axial length >38 mm. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old Chinese man with high myopia since childhood who had lost sight in his left eye at the age of 25 due to retinal detachment. He was referred for ophthalmological assessment due to decreased vision in the right eye, in which the best-corrected visual acuity at distance was hand motion. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with cataract, high myopia, subluxated lens, and loose zonules in the right eye. The left eyeball showed atrophy. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent uneventful phacoemulsification. An intraocular lens (Sensar AR40M) and capsular tension ring were implanted within the capsular bag. After surgery, the patient was given eye drops containing tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops for 1 month and eye drops containing 0.1% sodium diclofenac for 2 months. OUTCOME(S): There were no postoperative complications. During 1-year follow-up, uncorrected visual acuity was 20/80 and the manifest refraction was -2.50DS/-1.00DC*80, with corrected distance visual acuity of 20/60. Cataract surgery maintained adequate vision for daily living. LESSONS: Implantation of specific lens and capsular tension ring as well as prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help prevent capsular contraction and posterior capsule opacification in patients with pathologic myopia and extremely long axial length.

N2  - Gyrate atrophy is a rare metabolic autosomal recessive disorder caused by ornithine aminotransferase enzyme deficiency that leads to characteristic progressive, degenerative chorioretinal findings. Patients complain mostly of low vision, night blindness, and peripheral vision loss. Posterior subcapsular cataract, myopia, choroid neovascularization, and intraretinal cysts may be accompanying factors related to vision loss. We encountered a patient with vision loss secondary to posterior subcapsular cataract and intraretinal cysts. After treatment with topical brinzolamide and nepafenac (and without any diet mo dification and/or supplementation), we observed 143- and 117-mm macular thickness resolutions with 2 and 1 Snellen lines of visual gain in his right and left eyes, respectively. Also, we detected a novel homozygous mutation in the ornithine aminotransferase gene: c.1253T>C (p.Leu418Pro). Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and/or non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can control macular edema in patients with gyrate atrophy-associated intraretinal cysts. The genetic variants may also be a determinant in the responsiveness to the therapy type.

N2  - Aims To determine the prevalence of myopic maculopathy in the general population in Germany and to analyse potential associations with ocular and systemic factors. Design The Gutenberg Health Study is a population-based study, including 15 010 participants aged 35-74 years. Methods Myopic maculopathy was graded in phakic eyes with spherical equivalent <=-6 D by assessing fundus photographs according to a recent international photographic classification system (META-PM). 801 eyes of 519 participants (mean age 51.0+/-0.77 years) met the conditions and had gradable fundus photographs. Age-specific prevalence estimates were computed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess associated factors with myopic maculopathy. Results Myopic maculopathy was present in 10.3% (95% CI 7.9 to 13.3) study participants. The prevalence was 8.6% (95% CI 6.1% to 11.9%) in the 397 right eyes and 8.7% (95% CI 6.2% to 12.0%) in the 404 left eyes. The most common type of pathology was diffuse atrophy (8.1%), followed by patchy atrophy (1.3%) and macular atrophy (0.5%); plus lesions were present in 3% (right eyes). Age (OR 1.07 per year, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11, p<0.001), higher myopic refractive error (p<0.001), and male gender (p=0.02) were associated with myopic maculopathy, while cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic factors were not. Conclusions The prevalence of myopic maculopathy in the German population was 0.5%, and 10% in high myopic participants, aged 35-74 years. These population-based data are the first in Europe. Myopic maculopathy was related to severity of myopic refractive error and age.Copyright ©

N2  - Purpose To investigate the prevalence of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in the global population. Methods All published literature of population-based studies on MMD prevalence worldwide were searched and only those with clear definitions to diagnose and classify MMD lesions by standardised grading methods were selected. Meta-analysis methods were used to calculate the pooled prevalence of MMD and its 95% CI in a random-effects model. The prevalence of MMD lesions would also be reported, together with the subgroup analysis of age, region and gender. Correlation between MMD prevalence and spherical equivalent levels and axial length were also evaluated. Results 12 studies with 58 558 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of MMD in the world population was 2.1% (95% CI: 1.3% to 3.3%). In the subgroup analysis, people with the following characteristics were at higher risk of developing MMD: female, urban life, living in Asia, older age, longer axial length and severer myopia. Conclusions MMD is a serious public health concern worldwide, particularly in subjects who are women, subjects living in urban areas, subjects living in Asia, and subjects with longer axial lengths and severer myopia. Further studies from other continents/ethnicities are needed for comprehensive estimates of the prevalence of MMD globally.Copyright © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives To estimate the prevalence, ethnic differences and associated risk factors of myopic maculopathy in Han and Uygur adults in Xinjiang, China. Design and setting A cross-sectional study with multistage, stratified cluster sampling method was conducted in Xinjiang, China. Participants A total of 4023 Han and Uygur participants aged 40 years and older were eligible for the study. Outcome measures The association between myopic maculopathy and its risk factors was screened using the generalised estimating equation (GEE) model. We also investigated whether ethnic differences exist between Han and Uygur populations affected by myopic maculopathy. Myopic maculopathy was defined in accordance with International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy. Results A total of 3044 subjects (5946 eyes) were included in our study (1736 Han and 1308 Uygur individuals). The participants consisted of 1256 (41.3%) men and 1788 (58.7%) women. The average age was 52.2+/-9.4 years, and the mean spherical equivalent (SE) was -0.18+/-2.31 dioptre (D). Myopic maculopathy was detected in 198 eyes of 138 participants. The age-adjusted prevalence of myopic maculopathy reached 5.8% (95% CI 4.8 to 6.8). In the GEE model, myopic maculopathy was significantly associated with old age (per year; OR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.19; p<0.001) and myopic SE (per -1 D; OR: 1.48; 95% CI 1.40 to 1.56; p<0.001). No ethnic differences were detected between Han (98, 5.7%) and Uygur population (40, 3.1%) in terms of the prevalence of myopic maculopathy (OR=0.89; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.48; p=0.64). Neither urbanisation (p=0.38) nor the level of education (p=0.92) was associated with myopic maculopathy. Conclusions A high age-adjusted prevalence of myopic maculopathy was observed in Han and Uygur populations in Xinjiang, China. Old age and high degree of myopic refraction were independent risk factors for myopic maculopathy. No ethnic differences were detected in Han and Uygur populations affected by myopic maculopathy.Copyright © 2020 Royal Society of Chemistry. All rights reserved.

N2  - Importance: Myopic maculopathy is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment worldwide. Moreover, the burden of myopic maculopathy has been expected to increase owing to the rising prevalence of myopia globally. However, there is limited epidemiologic evidence regarding the incidence of and risk factors for myopic maculopathy. This study from Japan, with a relatively high prevalence of myopia, could provide valuable information related to these issues. Objective(s): To estimate the incidence of myopic maculopathy and its risk factors in Hisayama in southwestern Japan. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): A population-based prospective cohort study in a Japanese community in Hisayama, Japan. The study included a total of 2164 residents 40 years or older who had no myopic maculopathy at the baseline eye examination in 2012 and underwent follow-up eye examinations in 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of myopic maculopathy. The grades of myopic maculopathy were categorized based on the criteria of the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group classification system. Result(s): The mean (SD) age of the study participants was 62.4 (10.9) years, and the proportion of men was 42.5% (920 participants). In the follow-up examination in 2017, 24 patients developed myopic maculopathy. The 5-year cumulative incidence of myopic maculopathy was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.6-1.5) overall, 1.4% (95% CI, 0.6-2.2) for men, and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.4-1.4) for women. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age (per 1 year; odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11) and longer axial length (per 1 mm; OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.19-3.95) were associated with incident myopic maculopathy. Conclusions and Relevance: Twenty-four study participants (1%) developed myopic maculopathy during the 5-year study period, which is much higher than the rate in a previous study on a Chinese population. We also confirmed that aging and longer axial length were independent and significant risk factors for myopic maculopathy. These findings should be reviewed among various populations in other parts of the world.Copyright © 2020 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - Myopia has become a major public health problem in the world due to the increase in its prevalence in the past few decades and due to sight-threatening pathologies associated with high myopia such as cataracts, glaucoma and especially myopic maculopathy. This article is a narrative review of the evidence that currently exists on a contact lenses (CLs) specifically designed to correct myopia and to slow its progression. To contextualise the topic we discuss the different classifications and definitions that have been used for myopia, the current burden of being myopic, and current treatment options to prevent and control its progression. There is evidence that exposure to sunlight reduces the risk of myopia onset and pharmacological treatment with atropine has been shown to be the most effective therapy for controlling its progression, followed by optical interventions such as CL fitting (orthokeratology or CLs specific for myopia control) designed to decrease retinal peripheral hyperopic defocus that seems to be the theory that suggests that axial elongation is driven by this defocus and explains why the eye continues to grow abnormally after emmetropisation and generates myopia. We will especially focus on MiSight CLs. MiSight is a daily replacement soft contact lens that has been clinically proven and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to control the progression of myopia in children. We analyse the optical design of MiSight CLs, as well as the results of the different efficacy and safety studies that led to the approval of the lens by the FDA. We also expose current knowledge gaps, limitations and future directions.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the long-term outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling (FSIP) and standard ILM peeling for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). Design(s): Retrospective case series. Participant(s): A total of 102 eyes of 96 consecutive patients who underwent primary PPV for MTM and were followed up for at least 12 months. Method(s): We compared the outcomes of eyes that underwent vitrectomy with FSIP from October 2012 to March 2017 with those of eyes that underwent vitrectomy with standard ILM peeling from June 2008 to September 2012. Main Outcome Measure(s): Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 12 months and the final follow-up visit after surgery, time to MTM resolution, and postoperative complications such as macular hole (MH) formation. Result(s): There were 26 and 76 eyes in the FSIP and standard ILM peeling groups, respectively. In both groups, the mean visual acuity (VA) at the 12-month follow-up was significantly improved relative to the mean preoperative VA (P < 0.001 for both groups). The preoperative and postoperative BCVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) showed no significant between-group differences (preoperative: 0.60+/-0.35 in the FSIP group and 0.61+/-0.39 in the standard ILM peeling group, P = 0.935; postoperative BCVA: 0.32 +/- 0.43 in the FSIP group and 0.37 +/- 0.38 in the standard ILM peeling group, P = 0.281). The mean time to the resolution of foveal retinal detachment and schisis was also comparable between groups (8.9 +/- 4.8 months in the FSIP group and 6.9 +/- 4.6 months in the standard ILM peeling group, P = 0.084). None of the eyes in the FSIP group and 6 eyes (8%) in the standard ILM peeling group developed postoperative MH. Consequently, the BCVA at 12 months deteriorated by 3 or more lines for 4 eyes (5%) in the standard ILM peeling group; this deterioration was not observed for any eye in the FSIP group. Risk factors for postoperative MH formation were worse preoperative visual acuity (P = 0.035) and thinner choroidal thickness (P = 0.025). Conclusion(s): The visual and anatomic improvements after vitrectomy with FSIP may be comparable to those after vitrectomy with standard ILM peeling, with FSIP showing the ability to prevent postoperative MH formation and a consequent impairment in vision.Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Macular hemorrhage can occur spontaneously and repeatedly without choroidal neovascularization or other known lesions associated with myopia. We report a case of repeated myopic macular hemorrhage following fish oil supplementation. A 32-year-old male was referred with newly acquired paracentral scotoma in the left eye. Serial retinal imaging, including fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography were performed. Fundus photography and fluorescein angiography showed a subtle red-colored lesion nasal to the fovea. Optical coherence tomography showed a dome shaped elevation in the ellipsoid zone and interdigitation zone in the left eye. No known ocular risk factors for macular hemorrhage, such as choroidal neovascularization, lacquer cracks, Fuch's spot or choroid thinning or keratoconus were observed. After 2 months without any treatment, the left eye lesion disappeared. However 2 weeks later, another newly developed red-colored lesion close to the left fovea was observed. At that moment, the detailed medical history revealed that the patient had been regularly taking a high dose of commercially available fish oil supplement beginning one month before the first macular hemorrhage. After discontinuation of the fish oil, the second left hemorrhage resolved gradually over the following 8 weeks. No recurrent hemorrhages have been detected at the 12 months follow-up visits. Our observations suggest that the relative value of nutritional supplementation with high doses of fish oil should be cautioned in patients with repetitive retinal hemorrhage.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - Purpose: Our aim was to highlight the presence and the frequency of posterior staphyloma (PS) in non-highly myopic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients and to study the relationship between PS and choroidal thickness (CT). Method(s): This was a retrospective case-control study of 77 eyes (39 patients) with RP, axial length inferior to 26 mm and clinically preserved macular area. All patients underwent fundus photography, A- and B-scan ocular ultrasonography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). PS was defined by an outward bowing of the sclera on SS-OCT and B-scans. The relationship between the PS and SS-OCT layers thicknesses was determined. Result(s): Over 77 RP eyes of 39 patients studied, a PS was identified in 17 eyes (22%) of nine patients. Fifteen eyes had a narrow macular staphyloma (NMS), and two eyes had a wide macular staphyloma (WMS). Mean age in this group was 34.2 years (range 19-53 years), mean axial length was 23.60 +/- 0.61 mm and mean CT was 185.7 +/- 71 um versus 259.7 um in eyes without PS. The staphyloma edges corresponded to area of outer retina loss on SS-OCT and were larger than the hyperautofluorescent ring on FAF. We found a significant association between PS and CT in our RP patients (p = 0.003). The mean CT was significantly thinner in PS eyes compared to eyes without staphyloma. There was no significant association between PS and with visual acuity, years of progression, retinal thickness nor FAF findings. Conclusion(s): PS was present in 22% of non-highly myopic eyes with RP. Narrow macular staphyloma was the most common type observed in our series. A marked thinning of the choroid was noted in PS eyes when compared to RP eyes without PS, as well as the outer retina degeneration.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - Purpose: We investigated the natural course of the intraretinal hyperreflective (IRH) sign after macular haemorrhage (MHE) absorption in eyes with pathologic myopia. Method(s): This prospective observational cohort study evaluated 28 patients with pathologic myopia and MHE. The eyes were categorized into IRH and non-IRH sign groups according to IRH sign development. All eyes were evaluated; follow-up visits were scheduled at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after MHE absorption. Result(s): Of 28 patients (14 eyes each in the IRH and non-IRH groups), nine (32.1%) were men and 19 (67.9%) were women. The average age (mean +/- SD) was 46.64 +/- 11.92 versus 52.71 +/- 12.19 years in the IRH and non-IRH groups. The IRH sign coincided with the MHE invasion site. The sign persisted for the entire follow-up period in all but two eyes, in which it disappeared at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Maximal MHE thickness was significantly greater in the IRH sign group (162.9 +/- 67.84 versus 104.2 +/- 32.34 mum, p = 0.013). The mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity was significantly better in the non-IRH sign group at 12 (p = 0.029) and 24 (p = 0.033) months. The incidence of myopic traction maculopathies (MTM) was significantly higher in the IRH (57.1%) than in the non-IRH sign group (14.3%; p = 0.046). Conclusion(s): The IRH sign can develop after MHE in pathologic myopia and can remain stable long after MHE absorption; furthermore, it is predictive of future MTM.Copyright © 2019 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - PURPOSE. To determine the risk between degree of myopia and myopic macular degeneration (MMD), retinal detachment (RD), cataract, open angle glaucoma (OAG), and blindness. METHODS. A systematic review and meta-analyses of studies published before June 2019 on myopia complications. Odds ratios (OR) per complication and spherical equivalent (SER) degree (low myopia SER < -0.5 to > -3.00 diopter [D]; moderate myopia SER <= -3.00 to > -6.00 D; high myopia SER <= -6.00 D) were calculated using fixed and random effects models. RESULTS. Low, moderate, and high myopia were all associated with increased risks of MMD (OR, 13.57, 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.18-29.79; OR, 72.74, 95% CI, 33.18-159.48; OR, 845.08, 95% CI, 230.05-3104.34, respectively); RD (OR, 3.15, 95% CI, 1.92-5.17; OR, 8.74, 95% CI, 7.28-10.50; OR, 12.62, 95% CI, 6.65-23.94, respectively); posterior subcapsular cataract (OR, 1.56, 95% CI, 1.32-1.84; OR, 2.55, 95% CI, 1.98-3.28; OR, 4.55, 95% CI, 2.66-7.75, respectively); nuclear cataract (OR, 1.79, 95% CI, 1.08-2.97; OR, 2.39, 95% CI, 1.03-5.55; OR, 2.87, 95% CI, 1.43-5.73, respectively); and OAG (OR, 1.59, 95% CI, 1.33-1.91; OR, 2.92, 95% CI, 1.89-4.52 for low and moderate/high myopia, respectively). The risk of visual impairment was strongly related to longer axial length, higher myopia degree, and age older than 60 years (OR, 1.71, 95% CI, 1.07-2.74; OR, 5.54, 95% CI, 3.12-9.85; and OR, 87.63, 95% CI, 34.50-222.58 for low, moderate, and high myopia in participants aged >60 years, respectively). CONCLUSIONS. Although high myopia carries the highest risk of complications and visual impairment, low and moderate myopia also have considerable risks. These estimates should alert policy makers and health care professionals to make myopia a priority for prevention and treatment.© Copyright 2020 The Authors

N2  - PURPOSE. To examine the 6-year incidence, progression, associated risk factors, and impact of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in a myopic population in Singapore. METHODS. We examined myopic (spherical equivalent <=-0.5 diopters) adults (N = 2157 persons and 3661 eyes) who were phakic at baseline and participated in both baseline and 6-year follow-up visits of the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study. Eye examinations, including visual acuity, subjective refraction and axial length (AL) measurements, were performed. MMD was graded from fundus photographs following the META-PM classification. Vision-related quality of life was assessed with Rasch-transformed scores from reading, mobility, and emotional domains of the Impact of Vision Impairment questionnaire. RESULTS. The 6-year eye-specific incidence of MMD among myopic eyes was 1.2% (95% CI, 0.9%-1.6%). Older age, worse spherical equivalent, and longer AL at baseline were associated with MMD incidence (all P < 0.001). The 6-year eye-specific progression of MMD in 288 eyes with baseline MMD was 17.0% (95% CI, 12.6%-21.4%). More severe MMD at baseline, worse spherical equivalent, and longer AL (all P < 0.05) were associated with MMD progression. Patients with Meta-PM categories 3 and 4 had worse best-corrected visual acuity and poorer vision-related quality of life outcomes than those without MMD (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Over a 6-year period, one in 80 myopic eyes developed MMD and one in six with existing MMD had MMD progression. Myopia severity and AL were strong predictors of MMD development and progression. Eyes with severe MMD were at higher risk of MMD progression than those with less severe MMD, and were associated with poorer visual acuity and vision-related quality of life.© Copyright 2020 The Authors

N2  - Purpose: To report a case of bilateral idiopathic chorioretinal folds that seemed to be related to an atypical staphyloma. Observations: A 49-year old man without medical history consulted for slight vision loss and metamorphopsia in the left eye. The ophthalmologic examination revealed moderate myopia and bilateral chorioretinal folds in the posterior pole, confirmed by multimodal imaging. Orbital and systemic examinations ruled out all the known etiologies of chorioretinal folds. 3-D optical coherence tomography and B-scan suggested that the folds were related to an atypical staphyloma that developed in the temporal part of the fundus, while sparing the peripapillary area. The peripapillary area, spared by the staphyloma process, appeared as a "dome-shaped disc" compared to the staphylomatous area. Conclusion and importance: This case suggests that myopic patients with unusual staphyloma located outside the peripapillary area could develop chorioretinal folds.Copyright © 2020 The Authors

N2  - Myopia is an increasingly common condition that is associated with significant costs to individuals and society. Moreover, myopia is associated with increased risk of glaucoma, retinal detachment and myopic maculopathy, which in turn can lead to blindness. It is now well established that spending more time outdoors during childhood lowers the risk of developing myopia and may delay progression of myopia. There has been great interest in further exploring this relationship and exploiting it as a public health intervention aimed at preventing myopia in children. However, spending more time outdoors can have detrimental effects, such as increased risk of melanoma, cataract and pterygium. Understanding how spending more time outdoors prevents myopia could advance development of more targeted interventions for myopia. We reviewed the evidence for and against eight facets of spending time outdoors that may protect against myopia: brighter light, reduced peripheral defocus, higher vitamin D levels, differing chromatic spectrum of light, higher physical activity, entrained circadian rhythms, less near work and greater high spatial frequency (SF) energies. There is solid evidence that exposure to brighter light can reduce risk of myopia. Peripheral defocus is able to regulate eye growth but whether spending time outdoors substantially changes peripheral defocus patterns and how this could affect myopia risk is unclear. Spectrum of light, circadian rhythms and SF characteristics are plausible factors, but there is a lack of solid evidence from human studies. Vitamin D, physical activity and near work appear unlikely to mediate the relationship between time spent outdoors and myopia.Copyright ©Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

N2  - Purpose: To characterize profile of cytokines in aqueous humour of common macular diseases during intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Method(s): Aqueous humour from eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), diabetic macular oedema (DME), neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) or pathologic myopia associated choroidal neovascularization (pmCNV) was sampled prior to 1st (n = 144) and 2nd (n = 48) intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Cytokines including vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were quantitated and analysed along with retinal thickness data by optical coherence tomography (OCT) across two intravitreal injections and five macular disease types. Result(s): ICAM-1, IL-6 and VEGF are positively associated in the aqueous humour of naive eyes (r = 0.39-0.77, p = 0.018 to <0.0001). ICAM-1, VEGF and IL-6 were significantly higher in CRVO and DME while lowest in pmCNV (p < 0.0001). Reduction of central retinal thickness (CRT) as a favourable response to anti-VEGF therapy was in the order of CRVO, BRVO, DME and nAMD/pmCNV (p < 0.0001). The strongest predictor for favourable CRT reduction was baseline CRT (p < 0.0001) followed by baseline ICAM-1 (p = 0.04). After the 1st intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, VEGF in aqueous humour lowered significantly but ICAM-1 and IL-6 levels remained unchanged. ICAM-1 was not predictive for CRT reduction following 2nd anti-VEGF therapy. Conclusion(s): Rate of cytokine production is disease-dependent and higher in CRVO and DME. Anatomical response to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is disease-specific and best in RVO patients. A combination therapy using both anti-VEGF and anti-inflammatory therapeutics may be superior to single anti-VEGF therapy, at least for RVO and DME.Copyright © 2019 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - This study examined and compared outcomes of deep learning (DL) in identifying sweptsource optical coherence tomography (OCT) images without myopic macular lesions [i.e., no high myopia (nHM) vs. high myopia (HM)], and OCT images with myopic macular lesions [e.g., myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and retinoschisis (RS)]. A total of 910 SS-OCT images were included in the study as follows and analyzed by k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) using DL's renowned model, Visual Geometry Group-16: nHM, 146 images; HM, 531 images; mCNV, 122 images; and RS, 111 images (n = 910). The binary classification of OCT images with or without myopic macular lesions; the binary classification of HM images and images with myopic macular lesions (i.e., mCNV and RS images); and the ternary classification of HM, mCNV, and RS images were examined. Additionally, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for the binary classifications as well as the correct answer rate for ternary classification were examined. The classification results of OCT images with or without myopic macular lesions were as follows: AUC, 0.970; sensitivity, 90.6%; specificity, 94.2%. The classification results of HM images and images with myopic macular lesions were as follows: AUC, 1.000; sensitivity, 100.0%; specificity, 100.0%. The correct answer rate in the ternary classification of HM images, mCNV images, and RS images were as follows: HM images, 96.5%; mCNV images, 77.9%; and RS, 67.6% with mean, 88.9%.Using noninvasive, easy-to-obtain swept-source OCT images, the DL model was able to classify OCT images without myopic macular lesions and OCT images with myopic macular lesions such as mCNV and RS with high accuracy. The study results suggest the possibility of conducting highly accurate screening of ocular diseases using artificial intelligence, which may improve the prevention of blindness and reduce workloads for ophthalmologists.Copyright © 2020 Sogawa et al.

N2  - The macular neovascular disease is a group disorder with complex pathogenesis of neovascularization for vision impairment and irreversible blindness, posing great challenges to precise diagnosis and management. We prospectively recruited participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and pathological myopia (PM) and compared with cataract patients without fundus diseases as a control group. The serum metabolome was profiled by gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) analysis. Multivariate statistical methods as well as data mining were performed for interpretation of macular neovascularization. A total of 446 participants with macular neovascularization and 138 cataract subjects as the control group were enrolled in this study. By employing GC-TOFMS, 131 metabolites were identified and 33 differentiating metabolites were highlighted in patients with macular neovascularization. For differential diagnosis, three panels of specific metabolomics-based biomarkers provided areas under the curve of 0.967, 0.938, and 0.877 in the discovery phase (n = 328) and predictive values of 87.3%, 79%, and 85.7% in the test phase (n = 256). Personalized pathway dysregulation scores measurement using Lilikoi package in R language revealed the pentose phosphate pathway and mitochondrial electron transport chain as the most important pathways in AMD; purine metabolism and glycolysis were identified as the major disturbed pathways in PCV, while the altered thiamine metabolism and purine metabolism may contribute to PM phenotypes. Serum metabolomics are powerful for characterizing metabolic disturbances of the macular neovascular disease. Differences in metabolic pathways may reflect an underlying macular neovascular disease and serve as therapeutic targets for macular neovascular treatment.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

Y1  - 2020//
N2  - Purpose: This review discusses the etiology and pathogenesis of myopia, prevention of disease progression and worsening axial elongation, and emerging myopia treatment modalities. Introduction: Pediatric myopia is a public health concern that impacts young children worldwide and is associated with numerous future ocular diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment and other chorioretinal abnormalities. While the exact mechanism of myopia of the human eye remains obscure, several studies have reported on the role of environmental and genetic factors in the disease development. Method(s): A review of literature was conducted. PubMed and Medline were searched for combinations and derivatives of the keywords including, but not limited to, "pediatric myopia", "axial elongation", "scleral remodeling" or "atropine." The PubMed and Medline database search were performed for randomized control trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses using the same keyword combinations. Result(s): Studies have reported that detection of genetic correlations and modification of environmental influences may have a significant impact in myopia progression, axial elongation and future myopic ocular complications. The conventional pharmacotherapy of pediatric myopia addresses the improvement in visual acuity and prevention of amblyopia but does not affect axial elongation or myopia progression. Several studies have published varying treatments, including optical, pharmacological and surgical management, which show great promise for a more precise control of myopia and preservation of ocular health. Discussion(s): Understanding the role of factors influencing the onset and progression of pediatric myopia will facilitate the development of successful treatments, reduction of disease burden, arrest of progression and improvement in future of the management of myopia.Copyright © 2020 Pugazhendhi et al.

N2  - Purposes: This research aimed to investigate effects and risk factors on non-contact tonometer (NCT) readings in healthy myopic subjects by employing cross-sectional study design. Method(s): Totally, sixty otherwise healthy myopic volunteers (mean 28.4 years old) with 90% female were recruited in ophthalmic clinic. The routine ophthalmic tests, refractive evaluation, examination central corneal thickness (CCT), depth of anterior chamber, axial length, corneal curvature, white-to-white and NCT were assessed at baseline. The linear-mixed model was utilized to evaluate correlation between the readings and ocular biometric parameters. Result(s): For population in this study, mean spherical equivalents were - 4.85 +/- 1.79 diopters in right eyes and - 4.63 +/- 1.95 diopters in left eyes. Meanwhile, 28.3% of the eyes had a refractive error exceeding - 6.0 diopters. The mean NCT reading was 15.02 +/- 3.02 mmHg in left eyes and 15.33 +/- 2.96 mmHg in right eyes. Among the factors analyzed, CCT was the most significant parameter associated with NCT readings. After adjusting for the other factors, per one standard deviation increase of central corneal thickness (36.11 mum) was associated a 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.53-1.77) mmHg elevated NCT reading. The average central corneal curvature, age and spherical equivalence were also significantly and independently associated with NCT readings. Conclusion(s): Central corneal thickness, age, corneal curvature and degree of myopia were independently associated with NCT measured intraocular pressure. Central corneal thickness is one of the most influential factors.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate the progression and new onset of macular retinoschisis (MRS) in the patients treated with intravitreal Conbercept injections for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Method(s): Post-hoc analysis of 160 mCNV patients included in SHINY study was performed to evaluate the impact of Conbercept injection on MRS in patients with mCNV undergoing intravitreal Conbercept injections. The patients were 3:1 randomized to the study group (three loading dose and thereafter pro re nata [PRN]) and the control group (3 months' sham injection, then one Conbercept injection at month 4 and thereafter PRN). MRS was assessed with optical coherence tomography by masked graders. Result(s): At baseline, 28 of 122 eyes in study group and 10 of 38 eyes in control group had MRS. At month 3, two patients showed MRS progression and one patient had new onset MRS in study group. No MRS progression nor new onset MRS was found in the control group. At final visit, the cumulative incidence of MRS was 1.3% (2/160). Both Spearman's correlation and multiple logistic regression demonstrated no association between the progression and new onset of MRS and intravitreal injection frequency (correlation coefficient = 0.017, P = 0.851 and odds ratio = 0.996, P = 0.982). In addition, baseline vitreoretinal adhesion was the most likely potential risk factor resulting in MRS progression (odds ratio = 4.566, P = 0.027). Furthermore, MRS progression was more likely to take place in outer retinal layers. Conclusion(s): The progression and new onset of MRS was not associated with the frequency of intravitreal Conbercept injections.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

N2  - Purpose: Fixation stability (FS) of the preferred retinal locus (PRL) may be improved by biofeedback fixation training (BFT) with microperimetry. Such training can be done on the patient's PRL or in different retinal loci with better functional characteristics. We studied both options and compared the outcomes. Method(s): Sixty-seven consecutive patients with bilateral central vision loss, poor FS and visual acuity (VA) lower than 0.3 LogMAR were recruited for BFT with microperimeter. Patients were assigned into 2 groups. In group A, BFT was performed on the patient's spontaneous PRL. In group B, PRL was located between 2 adjacent loci with the highest light sensitivity and the lowest distance from the fovea. Two sets of 12 weekly BFT sessions were performed. Primary outcomes were: FS, VA and reading speed. Result(s): Outcomes were statistically significantly better in group B. Mean percentage of FS at therapy end improved from 32 to 35% for group A and from 40 to 55% in group B. Mean VA improved from 1 to 0.86 in group A and from 1 to 0.84 in group B. Reading speed (wpm) improved from 56 to 58 in group A and from 63 to 89 in group B. Conclusion(s): This study describes a reliable methodology of improving eccentric fixation stability using BFT in microperimetry, when the fixation training locus is individualized as the retinal area with best functional characteristics. Further studies are needed to validate its value in a larger scale of patients, at different stages of the disease, and its persistence over time.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: To determine the incidence and characteristics of intrachoroidal cavitation (ICC) in the eyes with high myopia. Method(s): In this retrospective, non-interventional, comparative study, we analysed the case records of 108 eyes with and without pathological myopia (PM). PM was defined as having a refractive error (spherical equivalent) of >= - 6.0 D or axial length >= 26 mm. The presence of other features like posterior vitreous detachment, myopic traction maculopathy, posterior staphyloma, focal/patchy chorioretinal atrophy (CRA), choroidal neovascularisation and retinoschisis was looked for on OCT. The association of these features with ICC was analysed using statistical tests. Result(s): In this study, 38 out of 68 eyes with PM and 4 out of 40 eyes with non-PM showed the bowing of the posterior sclera and the presence of ICC. On statistical analysis with Chi-square test and multiple variable linear regression analysis tests, it was identified that the presence of focal/patchy CRA (p = 0.005) and intrascleral vessels (p = 0.018) in and around the cavitation was important features noted in eyes with ICC. The OCT features of macular and peripapillary ICC were similar. The transudation of fluid from the dilated intrascleral vessels in and around the ICC could be one other mechanism responsible for the development of ICC. Conclusion(s): ICC is seen in 55.8% of highly myopic eyes with the presence of focal CRA or myopic conus and/or presence of intrascleral vessels near the cavitation. These findings suggest that patchy atrophy affects the scleral contour within posterior staphyloma beyond the funduscopically identified patchy atrophy by ICC. The presence of intrascleral vessels could also contribute to the ICC development. Eyes with patchy CRA or myopic conus needs to be checked on further follow-up visits for the development of macular or peripapillary ICC.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the long-term results of gas tamponade without vitrectomy in patients with myopic foveoschisis (FS) and foveal detachment (FD). Method(s): Twenty eyes of 20 patients with myopic foveoschisis and foveal detachment were analysed retrospectively. All patients received an intravitreal injection of 0.2-0.3 mL C3F8 as an initial treatment. The patients were followed up for at least 18 months after the procedure. The refractive status, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and anatomical abnormalities in macular area before and after the treatment were assessed and recorded. Result(s): After initial gas tamponade, FD resolved completely (defined as responders) in 14 eyes, resolved partially in 2 eyes (defined as partial responders), and worsened in 4 eyes (non-responders) at the 3-month follow-up visit. Vitrectomy was performed in four eyes that showed increased detachment (two cases) or developed macular hole (two cases). Repeated gas injection was performed in two recurrent cases after initial success at the 3-month follow-up, and the foveal detachment once again resolved. Overall, 70% of our cases demonstrated resolution of FD at the 3-month follow-up and the long-term responders to gas injection was 65%. The risk factors for treatment failure were: (1) The presence of optical coherence tomography (OCT)-evident premacular membranes (p = 0.03) and (2) the height of FS measured >588 microm (p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Our data supported that gas tamponade may be effective as an alternative treatment for selected cases of myopic FS with FD. The procedure may be especially beneficial in patients without OCT-evident premacular membranes and have low height of FS.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

N2  - Background Pathological myopia is one of the leading causes of blindness globally. Lower birth weight (BW) within the normal range has been reported to increase the risk of myopia, although findings conflict. We sought to estimate the causal effect of BW on refractive error using Mendelian randomisation (MR), under the assumption of a linear relationship. Methods Genetic variants associated with BW were identified from meta-analysis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for self-reported BW in 162 039 UK Biobank participants and a published Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium GWAS (n=26 836). We performed a one-sample MR analysis in 39 658 unrelated, adult UK Biobank participants (independent of the GWAS sample) using an allele score for BW as instrumental variable. A two-sample MR sensitivity analysis and conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses were also undertaken. Results In OLS analysis, BW showed a small, positive association with refractive error: +0.04 D per SD increase in BW (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07; p=0.002). The one-sample MR-estimated causal effect of BW on refractive error was higher, at +0.28 D per SD increase in BW (95% CI 0.05 to 0.52, p=0.02). A two-sample MR analysis provided similar causal effect estimates, with minimal evidence of directional pleiotropy. Conclusions Our study suggests lower BW within the normal range is causally associated with a more myopic refractive error. However, the impact of the causal effect was modest (range 1.00 D covering approximately 95% of the population).Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

N2  - Purpose: Precise risk estimates of myopic complications leading to irreversible vision loss are needed. In this study, we determined the risks of myopic macular degeneration (MMD), retinal detachment (RD), cataract, open-angle glaucoma (OAG), and blindness as a function of the degree of myopia. Method(s): We conducted a systematic review and performed metaanalyses. Odds ratios (OR) per complication and myopia category (mild, moderate and high) were calculated using fixed and random effect models. Result(s): Mild (<= -0.5D and > -3.0D), moderate (<= -3.0D and > -6.0D), and high (<-6.0) myopia were all associated with increased risks of MMD (OR = 13.57, 95% CI 6.18-29.79; OR = 72.74, 95% CI 33.18-159.48; OR = 845.08, 95% CI 3104.34, respectively); increasedrisks of RD (OR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.92-5.17; OR = 8.74, 95% CI 7.28- 10.50; OR = 12.62, 95% CI 6.65-23.94 respectively); increased risks of posterior subcapsular cataract (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.32-1.84; OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.98-3.28; OR = 4.55, 95% CI 2.66-7.75), nuclear cataract (OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.08-2.97; OR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.03-5.55; OR = 2.87, 95% CI 1.43-5.73); and OAG (OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.33- 1.91; OR = 2.92, 95% CI 1.89-4.52 for low and medium/high myopia, respectively). The risk of visual impairment was strongly related to axial length and age, and increased particularly in persons aged 60 years and over (OR = 1.71. 95% CI 1.07-2.74; OR = 5.54, 3.12-9.85; and OR = 87.63, 95% CI 34.50-222.58 for low, moderate, and high myopia, respectively). Conclusion(s): Although high myopia carries the highest risk of complications and visual impairment, mild and moderate myopia also have considerable risks. The increasing prevalence of myopia will affect patient care for virtually all subspecialties.

N2  - Objectives: To use a Markov model to forecast myopia disease burden in China in 2030 using currently available data Methods: A Markov model was built to quantify myopia and high myopia progression in China and predict disease burden up to 2030, based on prevalence data of myopia and high myopia. Published estimates and expert consensus were used to build and validate the model projections Results: By 2030, there were an estimated 755,126,617 myopia cases, or 56.18% of the total China population (all ages); and an estimate 226,902,188 high myopia cases, or 16.11% of the total China population (all ages). The complications increase as epidemics of myopia continues to grow. It is estimated that by 2030, the affected population will reach 44,301,529 (3.31% of all patients) for myopic retinopathy; 58,315,563 (4.33% of all patients) for myopic maculopathy; 48,907,428 (3.70% of all patients) for myopia-associated cataract; 3,927,843 (0.29% of all patients) for myopia associated open-angle glaucoma. The years lived with disability (YLD) will increase to 3,692,246 in China by 2030 Conclusion(s): This Markov model indicated that continued growth in myopia will result in increasing number of cases of myopia and myopia-associated complications, including myopic retinopathy, myopic maculopathy, cataract, and open-angle glaucoma. Slowing the growth in myopia, along with further potential therapies, are required to reduce the disease burden in blindness in ChinaCopyright © 2020

N2  - Purpose : Recent studies have shown the relevance of deep learning for detecting frequent pathologies, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma, in fundus photographs. However, due to insufficient training data, rare pathologies cannot be detected well through deep learning. We believe that ignoring rare pathologies is a strong limitation of current artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Therefore, this study investigates the use of few-shot learning, a far less data-demanding paradigm, to also detect rare pathologies: the idea is to reuse deep learning models previously trained to detect frequent pathologies. Methods : The AI was developed and evaluated using deidentified DR screening examinations from the OPHDIAT screening network in Paris, France. In this network, each screening examination is analyzed by one of seven certified ophthalmologists. Both structured and free-form examination reports were analyzed retrospectively: a list of 41 pathologies and pathological signs was established and ground truth was obtained for these 41 diagnoses on a subset of 115,159 images. The AI was developed using 32% of this dataset. Performance was evaluated in the remaining 68%, using the area under the ROC curve (Az). Results : Out of the 41 investigated pathologies and pathological signs, 37 could be detected well (Az>0.8). This includes degenerative myopia (Az=0.9999), central retinal vein occlusion (Az=0.9873), chorioretinitis (Az=0.9913), retinis pigmentosa (Az=0.9984), papilledema (Az=0.9510) and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (Az=0.9534). Of course, this also includes the most frequent pathologies: DR (Az=0.9882), glaucoma (Az=0.9733), cataract (Az=0.9834) and AMD (Az=0.9916). Signs that were poorly detected include shunts (Az=0.7586) and emboli (Az=0.7946). Additionally, the detected anomalies can be highlighted in images. Conclusions : We have designed an AI able to detect 37 pathologies and pathological signs in fundus photographs. This AI, which was developed and evaluated on a DR screening dataset, is expected to improve the usefulness and reliability of automated DR screening in the diabetic population: even if DR is not detected, a warning and a detailed report can be generated should another problem be detected. This AI might also be applied to mass screening of eye pathologies in the general population: future studies will thus investigate its performance in that more general context.

N2  - Purpose : Automatic retinal pathology screening using fundus photograph analysis plays a major role in visual impairment prevention. We have designed an artificial intelligence (AI) capable of automatically differentiating normal photographs from those showing at least one pathological sign. The AI was previously trained on fundus photographs extracted from a Diabetic Retinopathy screening network (OPHDIAT, France). The objective of this study is to evaluate it on a more general population, as part of mass screening in private practice. Methods : We retrospectively analyzed the data collected in a private screening network in the Le Mans region, France. Fundus images were acquired by orthoptists and read by a single ophthalmologist. Between 2017-2019, 8669 exams were conducted. The mean age of the population was 33 +- 22 years (min: 0, max: 97), and 56% were female. For each examination, only one ground truth annotation was obtained by a senior ophthalmologist. The report included the doctor's opinion: normal, abnormal or of poor quality as well as a free commentary describing, if necessary, the detected pathologies more precisely. AI's predictions were compared to ground-truth annotations among the 8131 examinations (17120 Images) of sufficient quality. Results : Compared to human reading, AI is able to differentiate between normal and abnormal examinations with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8454. By examining the free comments, we also studied the model's performance by pathology. The AI is particularly efficient at detecting age-related macular degeneration (AUC: 0.9857), degenerative myopia (AUC: 0.9767), but also less frequent pathologies such as coloboma (AUC: 0.9053), epiretinal membranes (AUC: 0.9626) or vascular tortuosities (AUC: 0.9538). Conclusions : The performance of automatic fundus photograph analysis in a mass screening context is very promising. These performances are probably underestimated considering the ground truth obtained by a single human reader. These results also show the generality of the AI, which was trained on a diabetic population and works very well on a more general population with different interpretation criteria. Given the severe shortage of ophthalmologists worldwide, this model of automatic retinal pathology screening using fundus photography analysis is therefore a promising solution for earlier patient management.

N2  - Purpose : Visual impairment is a chronic condition limiting many daily living activities as reading, writing and travelling. Low-vision services should provide innovative training programs to overcome the difficulties related to visual impairment including reaching the rehabilitation center. Tele-rehabilitation has been demonstrated to be a valid option to deliver rehabilitative care. EyeFitness (NIDEK Technologies Srl, Padua, Italy) (EF), is a new software device developed for achieving this goal, performing the visual training on the tablet or PC at home. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of EF on a group of low vision patients suffering from pathological myopia. Methods : Nine patients with pathologic myopia were selected for performing visual rehabilitation training at home with EF. The prescription defines the sequence and the repetitions of the 19 available exercises and, for each exercise, the set of parameters modeling the difficulty. Before starting with the home training the rehabilitator configured EF according to each patient visual functional characteristics. Home visual training was prescribed to each patient for a period of 10 weeks and consisted of 6 oculo-motor exercises. The clinician remotely veridied the patient's compliance with the prescribed training. Reading speed, recognition accuracy, contour tracing correctness and reaction time were evaluated before and after the home rehabilitation with EF. Moreover, each patient underwent an usability test in order to assess the ease of use of EF. Results : At the end of the training period, the average values of the considered evaluation parameters improved. In particular, the average reading speed increased from 45.6 +/- 12.6 wpm to 71.1 +/- 39.3 wpm. Accuracy, contour tracing correctness and reaction time improved from 56.9 +/- 19.5% to 68.4 +/- 18%, from 52.1 +/- 21.4% to 78.6 +/- 15.8%, and from 2.3 +/- 6.5 s to 1.9 +/- 7.3s respectively. The usability of EF was considered in the 78% of patients as "Good" and 22% as "acceptable". Conclusions : Results are encouraging, advocating that EF could be used for remotely delivering visual rehabilitation training to low-vision patients affected by pathologic myopia. Furthermore, patients themselves appreciated the tool's ease of use. Further studies on the effectiveness of EyeFitness for other diseases are also in progress.

N2  - Purpose : To assess changes in greatest linear dimension (GLD) of treated choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as measured using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in a dataset with 3.5 years of consecutive OCTA follow-up. Methods : A single center, retrospective analysis of patients treated for CNV with antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 1227 photography records of 405 patients with a diagnosis of CNV imaged on the OptoVue Avanti OCTA (Fremont, CA) from April 2016 to October 2019 were reviewed. OCTA scans were stringently selected to include images which captured the entire lesion and were free of OCTA artifacts. Images were manually segmented and GLD of the lesion was measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Figure 1 demonstrates an example of GLD measurements. Results : 25 patients (17 women) with a mean age of 69.8 years had CNV with OCTA images that met the inclusion criteria. CNV associated diagnoses included 19 neovascular age-related macular degeneration, 2 myopia, 2 idiopathic, 1 macular telangectasia, and 1 choroidal rupture. 22 CNV were treated prior to the first OCTA image (average 13 prior injections, range 1-52). Mean follow-up interval was 2.06 years (range 90-1234 days) with a mean of 10.9 injections (range 1-37).The average change in GLD was +34.26 mm2 (range -133 to +318 mm2). The mean change in GLD of treated lesions was +34.2 mm2 and +123 mm2 in the treatment-naive lesions. A paired t-test demonstrated a nonsignificant difference in the GLD of the CNV between the first and last images (p=0.24). The scatterplot in Figure 2 demonstrates no significant correlation between the absolute GLD difference and number of interval injections (R2 = 0.05, adjusted R2 = 0.009) Conclusions : Anti-VEGF has been described as a mediator of vascular pruning of immature vessels and increased vascular maturity. Changes in CNV morphology following treatment have been previously described, including shrinkage of peripheral and fine vessels. Few studies have longitudinally evaluated changes in CNV. The results suggest that GLD is an OCTA parameter that is not predictive of treatment burden and that with further treatment, GLD does not change significantly in patients with previously treated CNV.

N2  - Purpose : Retinal sensitivity may decrease in high myopia even without choroidal neovascularization or patchy chorioretinal atrophy. The association between retinal sensitivity and the integrity of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has not been studied in detail. In the present study, we investigated the association between retinal sensitivity and optical depolarization at the RPE layer measured by Polarization-Sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography (PS-OCT) in patients with high myopia. Methods : Among patients who visited at University of Tokyo Hospital, 23 highly myopic eyes (age, 66.6+/-12.3) without history of choroidal neovascularization or patchy chorioretinal atrophy, were included. High myopia was defined as a refractive error of less than -8.0 diopters (D) or an axial length of 26.5 mm or longer. Retinal sensitivity was measured by microperimetry in 25 points within 8 degrees from the fovea. Depolarization was measured by a clinical prototype of PS-OCT. RPE layer was automatically segmented and enface depolarization map was exported. 25 sectors corresponding to the point measured by microperimetry was overlaid to the depolarization map and the mean value in each sector was calculated. We used mixed model to investigate the association between retinal sensitivity, age, axial length, degree of depolarization in the RPE, choroidal thickness, and retinal thickness. Results : The average and deviation of retinal sensitivity, axial length, choroidal thickness, and retinal thickness was 25.3+/-1.7dB, 29.6+/-1.6mm, 82.5+/-30.7mum and 263.0+/-33.9mum, respectively. Axial length (beta=-0.53 [-0.92 to -0.13], p=0.01), degree of depolarization in the RPE (beta=5.0 [1.1 to 9.0], p=0.01) and retinal thickness (beta=0.0057 [0.00077 to 0.011], p=0.02) were significantly associated with retinal sensitivity. Conclusions : Retinal sensitivity and depolarization in the RPE measured with PS-OCT may be associated in patients with high myopia.

N2  - We investigated the clinical characteristics of cilioretinal arteries (CAs) and cilioretinal veins (CVs) in eyes with pathologic myopia. Ninety-five eyes with pathologic myopia and CAs were studied. The retrobulbar vessels from which the CAs originated were identified by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). The results showed that 114 CAs were identified in the 95 eyes. ICGA showed that 60% of the CAs branched directly off the short posterior ciliary arteries (SPCAs) and 40% originated from the Zinn-Haller arterial circle (ZHAC). The SPCA-derived CAs tended to be located superiorly and served a large retinal area whereas the ZHAC-associated CAs tended to be located temporally and served mainly the macular area. In 15% of the 95 eyes, the CVs were observed to run parallel to the CAs. The CVs exited the eye at the same point where the CAs entered the eye. This study showed that CAs in eyes with pathologic myopia can be divided into those that are SPCA-derived and tend to emerge in the superior optic disc sector, and those that are ZHAC-associated and usually emerge temporally. An elongating peripapillary scleral flange in eyes with progressive axial myopia may lead to a change of chorioretinal vascular system.

Imaging tests currently available and the advantages of each modality for detecting choroidal neovascularization signs are discussed. The management options and the outcomes of different treatment options are also reviewed. Recent Findings: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor has become the preferable choice of treatment in myopic choroidal neovascularization cases with improved results. The benefits of a single injection followed by PRN dosing were supported by randomized clinical trials. Summary: Choroidal neovascularization is a common vision threatening complication in patients with pathologic myopia. Most of the patients with this condition are younger than 50 years, and the major concern is to have vision preserved later in life. The investigation of myopic choroidal neovascularization imposes additional tests to be performed in most cases. Anti-vascular endothelial growth therapy has demonstrated superior efficacy over other treatment modalities. However, further studies are required for investigation of the risk factors for recurrences and the long-term treatment strategies.Copyright © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose: To measure the choroidal thickness in patients with high myopia from staphyloma using swept source OCT (SS-OCT) in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) fields and compare to normal cohort. The study also evaluated the correlation between choroidal thickness with axial length and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Method(s): In this prospective cross sectional study, 37 eyes of 20 patients with high myopia from staphyloma and 86 eyes of 43 normal subjects were included. In each eye, horizontal scans centered on the fovea (12 x 9 mm) were performed using SS-OCT (DRI-OCT, Topcon, Japan). Choroidal thickness in 9 ETDRS subfields, including central subfield (CSF) was analyzed and correlated with axial length as well as BCVA. Result(s): The axial length and BCVA in the high myopia from staphyloma group ranged from 25.12 to 33.54 mm (28.4 +/- 1.2) and 20/20-20/400, respectively. The choroidal thickness in staphyloma group was 85.53 +/- 48.61 mum as compared to 250.24 +/- 71.01 mum in the normal group (p < 0.0001). Stepwise regression analysis showed that axial length strongly correlated with decreased choroidal thickness (p < 0.001) in staphyloma group (r = 0.71, r2 = 0.5). Refractive error and BCVA moderately correlated(r = - 0.47; r2 = 0.22) with choroidal thickness (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Choroidal thickness in staphyloma (measured with novel technology of SS-OCT) patients is markedly reduced compared to normal controls. In addition, choroidal thickness strongly correlated with axial length of the eye and inversely correlated with visual acuity. This testing modality maybe used as a good predictor of visual acuity in patients with high myopia from staphyloma.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - Purpose:To determine the preoperative factors influencing visual recovery after vitrectomy for myopic foveoschisis. Method(s):Sixty-six eyes of 65 consecutive patients operated on for myopic foveoschisis were retrospectively included. All eyes underwent a preoperative ocular examination including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography with central foveal thickness measurement and foveal status classification: Simple foveoschisis, foveal detachment, or macular hole. To study the impact of preoperative visual acuity, 4 visual acuity groups separated by quartile ranges were defined. Postoperative visits at 1, 3, or 12 months including BCVA measurement and optical coherence tomography were recorded. Result(s):Mean refraction was-15.90 diopters, mean axial length was 30.30 mm, mean central foveal thickness was 590 m, and mean baseline logarithm of the maximum angle of resolution visual acuity was 0.68 (Snellen equivalent of 20/96). The final BCVA improved significantly from 3 months after surgery until the last follow-up visit; the mean logarithm of the maximum angle of resolution visual acuity at last follow-up was 0.43 (Snellen equivalent of 20/54). Mean central foveal thickness decreased significantly as soon as the first postoperative month (P < 0.0001). The preoperative BCVA was the only independent factor significantly correlated with the final BCVA as opposed to the foveal status (P < 0.0001). The mean BCVA and mean visual gain at the last follow-up visit were significantly different between the four visual acuity groups (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.017, respectively). Conclusion(s):The main factor influencing the postoperative visual acuity is the preoperative visual acuity. Although the preoperative anatomical status seemed important in surgeon decision making, once normalized on visual acuity, it no longer influenced the postoperative visual acuity.Copyright © Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To characterize the choriocapillaris (CC) in highly myopic eyes with myopic maculopathy, using optical coherence tomographic angiography. Method(s): Prospective, clinic-based study of 42 eyes of 38 patients with high myopia (<=-26 diopters and axial length >=26.5 mm). Myopic maculopathy was graded from fundus photographs according to the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia classification. Macular 33 mm en face optical coherence tomographic angiographic images were obtained with swept-source optical coherence tomographic angiography and graded for CC flow impairment as follows: 1) intact CC, 2) focal (<1 mm2), and 3) extensive (>1 mm2). Result(s): Of the 42 eyes, 17 (39.5%) had tessellated fundus, 20 (46.5%) had diffuse, and 6 (14.0%) had patchy atrophy. Choriocapillaris flow impairment was observed in all eyes with diffuse and patchy atrophy. Even in eyes with tessellated fundus only, CC signal voids were seen in 3 eyes (17.6%). With increasingly severe myopic maculopathy. the pattern of CC flow impairment changed from predominantly focal to predominantly extensive. Conclusion(s): Choriocapillaris flow impairment was observed in many highly myopic eyes, even in those with mild fundus changes, and worsened with increasing severity of myopic maculopathy. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether CC flow impairment predicts the risk of myopic maculopathy progression.Copyright © by Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.

N2  - This study aimed to investigate the protein expression profile of vitreous humor (VH) from pathologic myopic retinoschisis (PMRS) patients with or without intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. VH samples from PMRS patients were subjected to proteomic analysis. Clinical data, including visual acuity, refractive error, and axial length, were recorded, and the fundus optical coherence tomography was performed. Seven PMRS patients were enrolled: 3 PMRS patients as control group, 3 PMRS patients with coexisting choroidal neovascularization (CNV) who developed retinoschisis aggravation after multiple intravitreal conbercept (IVC) injections, and one PMRS patient with coexisting CNV without leakage CNV (CNV-). A total of 310 differentially expressed proteins were identified in these VH samples. The expression of 28 proteins, related to cellular adhesion, protease inhibitors, proangiogenic factors, and antiangiogenic factors, was significantly downregulated in the IVC-treated eyes than in control- and CNV-eyes. alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression was significantly upregulated in the IVC-treated eyes. Furthermore, the expression of alphaA-crystallin and fibrillin-1 was significantly upregulated in both IVC and CNV-eyes than in control eyes. These suggest that multiple IVC injections may increase the VH alphaSMA concentration, which may contribute to posterior hyaloid membrane or retinal inner limiting membrane contraction. Label-free proteomics is an efficient method to provide further insight into the pathogenesis of vitreoretinal diseases.© Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.

N2  - Myopia is one of the most prevalent eye diseases, and its advanced form, high myopia, is a leading cause of subsequent pathologic myopia, which in turn results in an increased risk of retinal diseases. The prevalence of myopia and high myopia is 28.3% and 4.0% of the global population, respectively, and these numbers are estimated to increase to 49.8% for myopia 9.8% for high myopia by 2050, thus making myopia a severe global socioeconomic problem. The eye shape has been receiving increasing attention as a possible biomarker for myopia. Among several modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently considered to be the best to measure the 3-dimensional eye shape, and one study using MRI revealed that myopic eyes became much larger in all 3 dimensions, but more so in length (0.35 mm/D) than in height (0.19 mm/D) or in width (0.10 mm/D), which fitted in global and axial elongation models. Another recent study reported that emmetropic retinas were oblate but oblateness decreased with myopia progression. According to a study to evaluate eye shapes in high myopia, although all emmetropic eyes had a blunt shape, almost half of the high myopic eyes had a pointed shape. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that abnormal eye shape changes can cause not only simple myopia but also various ocular complications through biomechanical stretching. In this review, we highlight recent findings on eye shape changes in myopic eyes and abnormal eye shapes in pathologic myopia.

N2  - Myopic foveoschisis (MF) is common in highly myopic eyes with posterior staphyloma, and optical coherence tomography is essential for establishing the diagnosis and monitoring disease progression. Untreated MF may lead to significant visual loss due to secondary complications. Vitrectomy with or without internal limiting membrane peeling followed by gas tamponade is the standard treatment; however, in recent years, new techniques, including macular buckling, have been introduced. We selected a total of 41 articles with 30 describing various modifications of pars plana vitrectomy, six describing the macular buckling technique, and five reporting combined surgery. The present review describes current MF treatment strategies, including outcomes, and provides a comprehensive understanding of current therapeutic options. Early detection and surgical intervention in eyes with specific risk factors may contribute to both improved visual recovery and more favorable anatomical outcomes.Copyright ©, © Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Vitrectomy combined with internal limiting membrane peeling (ILMP) treats high myopic foveoschisis with good results, but there is a risk of iatrogenic macular holes, which may be reduced by preserving the internal limiting membrane of the central fovea. This study compared complete ILMP with partial ILMP, both combined with 25G vitrectomy, for the treatment of high myopic foveoschisis.Thirty-three cases (33 eyes) of high myopic foveoschisis were retrospectively analyzed. They underwent 25G vitrectomy combined with C3F8 gas filling; Group A (20 patients, 20 eyes) underwent complete ILMP, while Group B (13 patients, 13 eyes) underwent partial ILMP to preserve the internal limiting membrane of the central fovea. Patients were followed up for 6 months and underwent best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure, diopter, slit lamp microscopy, indirect ophthalmoscope, A-mode and/or B-mode ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography. Surgical complications were recorded.Up to the last follow-up, the BCVA improved and central fovea thickness (CFT) was lower compared with before surgery in both groups (All P < .05). There were no significant differences in BCVA and CFT at each time point between the groups (P > .05). Most of the postoperative retinas of the 2 groups were completely reattached, with disappearance of the macular retinoschisis cavity. Two patients in the Group A and none in the Group B developed a macular hole during follow-up (P = .508).The results did not support the superiority of partial ILMP over complete ILMP in reduced incidence of macular hole. Both methods had a similar curative effect.

N2  - Purpose: To analyze the choroidal thickness (CT) of each type of myopic maculopathy, and to establish an OCT-based classification of myopic maculopathy. Design(s): Retrospective, hospital-based, cross-sectional study. Participant(s): Highly myopic (HM) eyes that were examined by swept-source OCT. Method(s): The CT was measured at the subfovea and at 3 mm nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior to the fovea. Myopic maculopathy was classified as tessellation, diffuse atrophy, patchy atrophy, and macular atrophy (MA) based on the fundus photographs. Diffuse atrophy was subdivided into peripapillary diffuse choroidal atrophy (PDCA) or macular diffuse choroidal atrophy (MDCA). Main Outcome Measure(s): The CT of each type of myopic maculopathy and cut-off value for diagnosis of diffuse atrophy. Result(s): We studied 1487 eyes of 884 patients (mean age: 58 years; mean axial length [AxL]: 29.9 mm). Subfoveal CT decreased with an increase in the severity of the myopic maculopathy. The mean subfoveal CT in HM eyes with normal fundus was 274.5 mum, with tessellation was 129.1 mum, with PDCA was 84.6 mum, with MDCA was 50.2 mum, with patchy atrophy was 48.6 mum, with choroidal neovascularization-related MA was 27.3 mum, and with patchy atrophy-related MA was 3.5 mum. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal CT to predict the presence of PDCA was 56.5 mum nasally, and the CT to predict the presence of MDCA was 62 mum subfoveally. The subfoveal CT was not significantly different in eyes with MDCA and patchy atrophy. A decrease of the subfoveal CT was associated with an older age (P < 0.001), longer AxL (P < 0.001), presence of myopic maculopathy (P < 0.001), and presence of CNV (P = 0.002). A decrease of best-corrected visual acuity was not significantly associated with the subfoveal CT. Conclusion(s): Progressive and continuous choroidal thinning plays a key role in the progression from no maculopathy to tessellation and to diffuse atrophy. The cut-off value of CT can be used for diagnosing PDCA and MDCA. For progression from MDCA to patchy atrophy, factors other than further choroidal thinning such as Bruch membrane defect may be involved. The subfoveal CT was not a predictor of visual acuity in HM eyes without CNV.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - A posterior staphyloma is an outpouching of a circumscribed region of the posterior fundus and has been considered a hallmark of pathologic myopia. Occurring in highly myopic eyes, it is histologically characterized by a relatively abrupt scleral thinning starting at the staphyloma edge, a pronounced de-arrangement of scleral collagen fibrils and a marked choroidal thinning, which is the most marked at the staphyloma edge and which occurs in addition to the axial elongation-associated choroidal thinning. Besides in highly myopic eyes, a posterior staphyloma can be found in non-highly myopic eyes in association with retinitis pigmentosa or localized defects of Bruch's membrane in the cases of which it is not associated with a marked choroidal thinning. The diagnosis of posterior staphylomas is considered best made by wide-field optical coherence tomography, because wide-field optical coherence tomography encompasses the entire extent of the most predominant type of staphylomas (i.e., the wide macular type)and since it also has a sufficiently high resolution of images (in contrast to ultrasonography, computed tomography and three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging). While the etiology of posterior staphylomas has remained unclear, local choroidal factors and a locally decreased biomechanical resistance of the sclera against a posteriorly expanding Bruch's membrane have been one of the assumed pathogenic parameters. For the therapy of staphylomas, scleral reinforcement strategies such as by posterior encircling bands, posterior scleral collagen cross-linking or scleral regeneration have been discussed or performed, however, with the pathogenesis being elusive, the therapy of staphylomas has remained undetermined.Copyright © 2018

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept for patients with choroidal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (cn-AMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), macular oedema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO-MO) and myopic choroidal neovascularisation (m-CNV). Design(s): Systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis. Method(s): Multiple databases were searched from inception to 17 August 2017. Eligible head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the (anti-VEGF) drugs in adult patients aged >=18 years with the retinal conditions of interest. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Result(s): 19 RCTs involving 7459 patients with cn-AMD (n=12), DMO (n=3), RVO-MO (n=2) and m-CNV (n=2) were included. Vision gain was not significantly different in patients with cn-AMD, DMO, RVO-MO and m-CNV treated with bevacizumab versus ranibizumab. Similarly, vision gain was not significantly different between cn-AMD patients treated with aflibercept versus ranibizumab. Patients with DMO treated with aflibercept experienced significantly higher vision gain at 12 months than patients receiving ranibizumab or bevacizumab; however, this difference was not significant at 24 months. Rates of systemic serious harms were similar across anti-VEGF agents. Posthoc analyses revealed that an as-needed treatment regimen (6-9 injections per year) was associated with a mortality increase of 1.8% (risk ratio: 2.0 [1.2 to 3.5], 2 RCTs, 1795 patients) compared with monthly treatment in cn-AMD patients. Conclusion(s): Intravitreal bevacizumab was a reasonable alternative to ranibizumab and aflibercept in patients with cn-AMD, DMO, RVO-MO and m-CNV. The only exception was for patients with DME and low visual acuity (<69 early treatment diabetic retinopathy study [ETDRS] letters), where treatment with aflibercept was associated with significantly higher vision gain (>=15 ETDRS letters) than bevacizumab or ranibizumab at 12 months; but the significant effects were not maintained at 24 months. The choice of anti-VEGF drugs may depend on the specific retinal condition, baseline visual acuity and treatment regimen.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

N2  - Introduction: This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab compared with best supportive care (BSC; considered to be no active treatment) for the treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with causes other than neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and pathologic myopia (PM) in a UK setting. Method(s): An individual patient-level simulation model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of ranibizumab vs. BSC. Regression analyses, performed on patient-level data collected within the pivotal phase III MINERVA trial, modelled visual acuity (VA) progression while patients remained on treatment. Patient utilities were modelled as a function of VA in both eyes and resource use estimates were based on trial data or the literature. Costs were evaluated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and personal social services, with future costs and health outcomes discounted at 3.5% per annum. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted. Result(s): The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for intravitreal ranibizumab was 1363 per QALY compared to BSC and was associated with an incremental benefit of 1.06 QALYs and an incremental cost of 1444 per patient. Drug and administration costs of intravitreal ranibizumab were offset by the prevention of the development of blindness and its associated costs, while the increase in benefits was driven by a reduction in mortality risk and an improved health-related quality of life attributed to an improvement in VA. The findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses and ranibizumab consistently remained cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000-30,000 per QALY gained for all sensitivity analyses. Conclusion(s): Intravitreal ranibizumab is a highly cost-effective intervention for the treatment of CNV due to causes other than nAMD and PM as it delivers substantial QALY gains to patients while making cost savings vs. BSC.

N2  - Importance: The optimal treatment regimen for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) is essential to understand but currently poorly studied. Background(s): To date, there is still no consensus on the optimal dosage and frequency of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections in treating mCNV. Design(s): A prospective, single-centre, single-blind, randomized controlled study. Participant(s): Adult patients with active mCNV. Method(s): Patients were randomized 1:1 to one or three doses initial ranibizumab treatments. Additional injections were administered pro re nata (prn) over 12 mo. Main Outcome Measure(s): Number and frequency of injections. Result(s): Fifty patients participated in the study. Patients in both 1 + prn or 3 + prn groups experienced similar best-corrected visual acuity gain and anatomical improvement, including central retinal thickness (CRT), CNV thickness, area of CNV and area of leakage. Over 12 mo, patients in the 1 + prn group received fewer ranibizumab injections (2.04 +/- 1.22) compared with the 3 + prn group (3.58 +/- 0.72, P<0.0001), but no statistic difference of the injection received was observed in the prn period. During the follow-up, 15 of 26 eyes in the 1 + prn group and 10 of 24 eyes in the 3 + prn group received additional injections after initial dosing (P = 0.2575). Cox regression analysis showed that 1 + prn, female, age > 55 y and CRT > 300 mum are risk factors for retreatment. Conclusions and Relevance: The eyes with a single loading dose achieved parallel anatomical and functional visual improvement, while required less injections over 1 y. The risk factors for retreatment include 1 + prn, female, older age and thick retina thickness.Copyright © 2018 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists

N2  - Purpose: We estimated the potential global economic productivity loss resulting from vision impairment (VI) and blindness as a result of uncorrected myopia and myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in 2015. Clinical Relevance: Understanding the economic burden of VI associated with myopia is critical to addressing myopia as an increasingly prevalent public health problem. Method(s): We estimated the number of people with myopia and MMD corresponding to critical visual acuity thresholds. Spectacle correction coverage was analyzed against country-level variables from the year of data collection; variation in spectacle correction was described best by a model based on a human development index, with adjustments for urbanization and age. Spectacle correction and myopia data were combined to estimate the number of people with each level of VI resulting from uncorrected myopia. We then applied disability weights, labor force participation rates, employment rates, and gross domestic product per capita to estimate the potential productivity lost among individuals with each level and type of VI resulting from myopia in 2015 in United States dollars (US$). An estimate of care-associated productivity loss also was included. Result(s): People with myopia are less likely to have adequate optical correction if they are older and live in a rural area of a less developed country. The global potential productivity loss associated with the burden of VI in 2015 was estimated at US$244 billion (95% confidence interval [CI], US$49 billion-US$697 billion) from uncorrected myopia and US$6 billion (95% CI, US$2 billion-US$17 billion) from MMD. Our estimates suggest that the Southeast Asia, South Asia, and East Asia Global Burden of Disease regions bear the greatest potential burden as a proportion of their economic activity, whereas East Asia bears the greatest potential burden in absolute terms. Conclusion(s): Even under conservative assumptions, the potential productivity loss associated with VI and blindness resulting from uncorrected myopia is substantially greater than the cost of correcting myopia.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Myopia is an important public health problem due to its prevalence and significant public health cost. Elevating levels of myopia increase the risk of vision impairment, and therefore, high myopia has become one of the main causes of untreatable vision loss throughout the world due to its irreversible complications. At present, many options for slowing progression of myopia have already been proposed and evaluated such as progressive addition of executive bifocal spectacle lenses, peripheral defocusing lenses, overnight orthokeratology, pharmacological agents such as atropine eye drops, and multifocal soft contact lenses (MFSCLs). Use of MFSCLs has especially increased in recent years due to the growing demand to slow myopia progression during patient's adolescent growth period to avoid pathological myopia in adulthood. Compared with the other traditional methods of controlling myopia, MFSCLs allow myopic patients to better maintain their clear visual quality and slow myopia progression. In this manuscript, we aim to review the basics of myopia, recent advances in contact lenses to control myopia with emphasis on MFSCLs, define the elements for proper MFSCL fittings (such as pupil size, aberrations, accommodation and centering), discuss the potential rebound effect after discontinuation of contact lenses, and future directions for improvements of contact lenses for the control of myopia.Copyright © Ivyspring International Publisher.

N2  - Aims To evaluate the prevalence of myopic maculopathy among participants aged 50 years and older in rural southern China. Methods Population-based, cross-sectional study. Subjects were recruited using cluster sampling from Yangxi County, Guangdong Province, China from August to November in 2014. Non-cycloplegic autorefraction and fundus photography were performed on all of the participants. Myopic maculopathy was graded based on fundus photographs using the International Classification of Myopic Maculopathy. Results Among 5825 individuals who participated (90.7% response rate), a total of 4469 participants with gradable fundus photographs for myopic maculopathy and automated refractive data were included in this study. The mean age of these participants was 65.50+/-9.70 years. The crude prevalence of myopic maculopathy was 1.4% (62/4469; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0% to 1.8 %) and age-standardised prevalence was 1.2% (95% CI 1.1% to 1.2%). Diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, lacquer cracks and staphyloma were observed in 43 (1.0%), 3 (0.1%), 1 (0.1%), 15 (0.3%) and 8 eyes (0.2%), respectively. Myopic maculopathy was more common in eyes of older participants (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11) and more myopic spherical equivalence (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.57 to 1.84). Conclusion The prevalence of myopic maculopathy was low among the rural southern Chinese population. Diffuse chorioretinal atrophy was the most common retinal finding among Chinese myopes.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the association between choroidal thickness and persistent subretinal fluid (PSF) after surgery for recent-onset rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Design(s): Case-control study. Participant(s): Fourteen eyes with macula-off RRD (with fovea on and off) that achieved retinal reattachment on funduscopy and demonstrated PSF after surgery (PSF group) were compared with 62 eyes with macula-off RRD (with fovea on and off) that did not demonstrate PSF after surgery (non-PSF group). Method(s): The diagnosis of PSF was made by the detection of subretinal fluid pockets on OCT beyond 6 weeks after surgery. Covariates included baseline demographics, duration of RRD, area of RRD, foveal status, method of subretinal fluid drainage, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes, and choroidal thickness in both eyes. Multivariate regression analysis was performed by adding gender, age, and pathologic myopia into the model. The secondary outcomes included postoperative vision and time to resolution of PSF. Main Outcome Measure(s): Subfoveal choroidal thickness in affected eyes, measured by enhanced depth imaging OCT images. Result(s): The percentage of eyes that underwent vitrectomy, scleral buckle surgery, and pneumatic retinopexy were 71.4%, 14.3%, and 14.3% in the PSF group, respectively, and 87.1%, 11.3%, and 1.6% in the non-PSF group, respectively. Eyes with PSF showed significantly thicker subfoveal choroid than eyes without PSF (305+/-61 mum vs. 200+/-70 mum, respectively; adjusted difference, 78.6+/-19.1 mum; 95% confidence interval [CI], 40.3-116.8 mum; P < 0.001). The PSF group demonstrated a greater proportion of RPE changes in fellow eyes (30.8% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.03) and significantly worse best-corrected visual acuity at the 12-month follow-up (P = 0.03). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that choroidal thickness of 280 mum or more was a significant factor associated with the presence of PSF (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 13.4; 95% CI, 3.1-34.7 [P = 0.001]. Conclusion(s): Persistent subretinal fluid is associated with increased subfoveal choroidal thickness in surgical and fellow eyes and with RPE changes in the fellow eye. This indicates that PSF likely belongs to the pachychoroid spectrum. In affected eyes, PSF tends to persist for more than 1 year and results in delayed visual recovery.Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the characteristics, mergers, and risk factors of different types of myopic maculopathy (MM) in a highly myopic population. Design(s): Population-based, cross-sectional study. Method(s): A total of 1086 eyes (762 patients) were enrolled. Each participant underwent detailed ocular examinations. Combining the fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography images, types of MM were assessed as myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM), myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM), or myopic neovascular maculopathy (MNM) according to the ATN classification system. Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) area, tilt ratio, and macular choroidal thickness (mChT) were measured individually. Result(s): Eyes with larger PPA area were more likely to have MAM (odds ratio [OR], 1.220; P = .037 per 1-mm2 increase) and MNM (OR, 1.723; P < .001 per 1-mm2 increase), and eyes with thicker mChT were less likely to have MAM (OR, 0.740; P < .001 per 10-mum increase) and MNM (OR, 0.784; P < .001 per 10-mum increase), whereas eyes with higher tilt ratio were less likely to have MTM (OR, 0.020; P < .001 per 1 increase). The severity of MTM and MNM was not precisely consistent with that of MAM. Conclusion(s): Different types of MM have different risk factors; larger PPA area and thinner mChT are risk factors for MAM and MNM, whereas lower tilt ratio is a risk factor for MTM. Our results indicate that the pathogenesis of MTM is different from that of MAM and MNM, and a tractional component should be considered as a possible component to the myopic macular classification.Copyright © 2019 The Authors

N2  - Purpose:To describe the characteristics of retinal telangiectasia in eyes with pathologic myopia. Method(s):The study included 10 patients (18 eyes) who were diagnosed with pathologic myopia combined with retinal telangiectasia. The patients visited our retinal clinic every 3 months. Nine eyes underwent vitrectomy for vision-threatening complications after diagnosis. All eyes underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations including multimodal retinal imaging at presentation and at each follow-up. Result(s):Retinal telangiectasia in pathologic myopia was characterized by saccular aneurysmal dilatation of the capillary bed without hard exudates in color fundus photographs and hyporeflective saccular structure in infrared reflectance fundus photographs, and it was filled in the early retinal arteriovenous phase with minimal dye leakage in the late phase of fundus fluorescein angiography. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomographic angiography showed that retinal telangiectasia was primarily located in the superficial retina, together with myopic traction maculopathy. In the 9 eyes that underwent vitrectomy, the retinal telangiectasia regressed within 3 months of surgery. Retinal telangiectasia remained stable in the other nine eyes, but these eyes were at risk of spontaneous bleeding. Conclusion(s):Retinal telangiectasia is a relatively quiescent and uncommon disorder in patients with pathologic myopia that might be closely related to myopic traction maculopathy.Copyright © by Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the long-term effect of cataract surgery on highly myopic patients with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and the risk factors associated with MTM progression. Method(s): Highly myopic patients with cataract and MTM were included. Phacoemulsification surgery was performed on patients who had vision loss below 20/63 and were willing to operation. Exclusion criteria included full thickness macular hole, foveal/retinal detachment, history of vitreoretinal surgery, myopic choroidal neovascularization, macular chorioretinal atrophy, peripheral lattice degeneration, incomplete follow up, or intraoperative complications. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination. Optical coherence tomography examinations and microperimetry examinations were performed. Result(s): A total of 229 patients (mean age: 57 +/- 6 years) were recruited, including 179 operated patients and 50 unoperated patients. Both the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular sensitivity (MS) were significantly improved after cataract surgeries throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.000). No difference was found in the proportion of MTM staging and in the rate of resolving/stable or progressive MTM (p = 0.757) between the operated and the unoperated groups. Of all patients, those with S2 to S4 MTM at baseline had significantly higher risk of progressive MTM (p < 0.001). Patients with absence of posterior vitreous detachment or with longer axial length at baseline had higher risks of progressive MTM. Conclusion(s): Cataract surgery generally improves the BCVA and MS of highly myopic patients with MTM. Preoperative vitreoretinal adhesion, longer axial length, and S2 to S4 MTM are risk factors for progressive MTM. A long-term follow-up on the development of MTM is recommended.Copyright © 2019, The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

N2  - Purpose: To identify the accurate clinical diagnosis of rare syndromic inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) based on the combination of clinical and genetic analyses. Method(s): Four unrelated families with various autosomal recessive syndromic inherited retinal diseases were genetically investigated using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Result(s): Two affected subjects in family MOL0760 presented with a distinctive combination of short stature, developmental delay, congenital mental retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Subjects were clinically diagnosed with suspected Kabuki syndrome. WES revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.5492dup, p.Asn1831Lysfs*8) in VPS13B that is known to cause Cohen syndrome. The index case of family MOL1514 presented with both RP and liver dysfunction, suspected initially to be related. WES identified a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.1787_1788del, p.His596Argfs*47) in AGBL5, associated with nonsyndromic RP. The MOL1592 family included three affected subjects with crystalline retinopathy, skin ichthyosis, short stature and congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and were found to harbour a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.682C>T, p.Arg228Cys) in ALDH3A2, reported to cause Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS). In the fourth family, SJ002, two siblings presented with hypotony, psychomotor delay, dysmorphic facial features, pathologic myopia, progressive external ophthalmoplegia and diffuse retinal atrophy. Probands were suspected to have atypical Kearns-Sayre syndrome, but were diagnosed with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-20 due to a novel suspected missense variant (c.1691C>T, p.Ala564Val) in VARS2. Conclusion(s): Our findings emphasize the important complement of WES and thorough clinical investigation in establishing precise clinical diagnosis. This approach constitutes the basis for personalized medicine in rare IRDs.Copyright © 2019 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

N2  - PURPOSE. To quantify the thickness of the outer retinal sublayers and choroid in pathological myopia and examine associations between these factors and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). METHODS. The cohort was composed of 21 eyes with emmetropia and 70 eyes with high myopia (49 simple high myopia; 21 pathological myopia). Optical coherence tomography images were segmented to determine macular thicknesses of the choroid and the following outer retinal sublayers: outer plexiform layer (OPL), Henle fiber layer and outer nuclear layer (HFL + ONL), myoid and ellipsoid zone (MEZ), outer segment of photoreceptors (OS), and interdigitation zone and RPE/Bruch complex (IZ + RPE). Correlations between BCVA and thickness of the outer retinal sublayers and choroid were determined. RESULTS. In pathological myopia, the choroid, HFL + ONL, MEZ, and IZ + RPE were thinner than in emmetropia and simple high myopia (P < 0.05). Simple and multiple regression models showed that MEZ thickness was correlated with BCVA (both P < 0.001). The relationship between MEZ thickness and BCVA varied with choroidal thickness (P = 0.006). For a constant MEZ thickness, thinner choroids were associated with worse vision. In the final multiple regression predictive model, MEZ thickness, choroidal thickness, and interaction between MEZ and choroidal thickness (all P < 0.001) were predictors of BCVA. CONCLUSIONS. Outer retinal alterations, especially thinning of the MEZ, occurred in pathological myopia. The MEZ thickness was associated with BCVA, and this relationship was affected by choroidal thickness.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - PURPOSE. To evaluate the 2-year changes in myopic maculopathy and its associations in highly myopic eyes. METHODS. This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study involving 657 Chinese participants with bilateral high myopia (6.00 diopters spherical power), who were followed for 2 years. The worst eye of each participant was considered for the analysis. Myopic maculopathy was graded based on fundus photographs, using the International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy. RESULTS. The mean baseline age was 21.6 6 12.2 years (range, 6.8-69.7 years). Myopic maculopathy progressed in 97 (14.8%) of 657 eyes, of which 24 eyes progressed to a higher category of myopic maculopathy, including from no maculopathy to tessellated fundus in 17 eyes, from tessellated fundus to diffuse atrophy in 6 eyes, and from diffuse to patchy atrophy in 1 eye. Among 122 lesion changes identified, the most common changes were enlargement of diffuse atrophy (n 1/4 50, 41.0%), appearance of lacquer cracks (n 1/4 28, 23.0%), enlargement of patchy atrophy (n 1/4 10, 8.2%) and development of additional lacquer cracks (n 1/4 7, 5.8%). In addition, we identified 1 eye with enlargement of a Fuch's spot, and 1 eye with active choroidal neovascularization. In multiple logistic regression analysis, myopic maculopathy progression was associated with older age, longer axial length, greater change in myopic spherical equivalent and more severe myopic maculopathy at baseline. CONCLUSIONS. Myopic maculopathy progressed in approximately 15% of highly myopic eyes over a 2-year period. Further studies with longer follow up periods are required to confirm identified risk factors for progression.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - PURPOSE. We provide a standardized set of terminology, definitions, and thresholds of myopia and its main ocular complications. METHODS. Critical review of current terminology and choice of myopia thresholds was done to ensure that the proposed standards are appropriate for clinical research purposes, relevant to the underlying biology of myopia, acceptable to researchers in the field, and useful for developing health policy. RESULTS. We recommend that the many descriptive terms of myopia be consolidated into the following descriptive categories: myopia, secondary myopia, axial myopia, and refractive myopia. To provide a framework for research into myopia prevention, the condition of ''pre-myopia'' is defined. As a quantitative trait, we recommend that myopia be divided into myopia (i.e., all myopia), low myopia, and high myopia. The current consensus threshold value for myopia is a spherical equivalent refractive error 0.50 diopters (D), but this carries significant risks of classification bias. The current consensus threshold value for high myopia is a spherical equivalent refractive error 6.00 D. ''Pathologic myopia'' is proposed as the categorical term for the adverse, structural complications of myopia. A clinical classification is proposed to encompass the scope of such structural complications. CONCLUSIONS. Standardized definitions and consistent choice of thresholds are essential elements of evidence-based medicine. It is hoped that these proposals, or derivations from them, will facilitate rigorous, evidence-based approaches to the study and management of myopia.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose:To determine the 5-year outcome of intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) for myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Method(s):We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 51 eyes of 51 consecutive patients with myopic CNV who had been treated with IVR with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years after the initial IVR injection. The factors that predicted the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 5 years after IVR were determined by multiple regression analysis. Result(s):The mean age of the subjects was 63.6 years, and the mean axial length was 29.4 mm. The mean number of IVR was 1.6, and 34 eyes (66.7%) had only a single IVR. At the baseline and at the 1-year, 2-year, 4-year, and 5-year period, the mean BCVAs were 20/49, 20/37, 20/41, 20/45, and 20/42, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the BCVA at 5-year period was significantly correlated with the baseline BCVA, the number of IVR injections, and the size of the CNV-related macular atrophy. Conclusion(s):Intravitreal ranibizumab provide a 5-year visual benefit in eyes with myopic CNV compared with the natural course. A lack of enlargement of the CNV-related macular atrophy, a better baseline BCVA, and a minimum number of IVR injections were associated with better visual outcomes.Copyright © 2019 by Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.

N2  - Background: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease causing progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells. The most severe form of this disease is X-linked RP (XLRP), in which photoreceptor degeneration begins in early childhood and complete blindness often occurs by the fourth decade of life. Two genes commonly associated with XLRP have been previously identified. Material(s) and Method(s): One Spanish family with confirmed XLRP was studied for mutations using direct sequencing. A genotype-phenotype correlation with pathologic myopia (PM) is detailed. Result(s): A new pathogenic mutation in the third exon of the RP GTPase regulator (RPGR) was identified: a variant c212C>G (pSER71*). This mutation appears as a hemizygous variant in the male proband with RP, and as heterozygous variant in the females of this pedigree who invariably exhibit symmetrical PM in both eyes. Conclusion(s): A complete family history allowed determination of the inheritance pattern providing genetic counseling for patients and their families. The geno-phenotypic attributes of this heterozygosity suggest a correlation between RP and PM. This novel mutation would expand the mutation spectrum of RP2 and RPGR, and help to study molecular pathogenesis of RP.Copyright © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate criteria driving retreatment with ranibizumab in Italian patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Method(s): OLIMPIC was a 12-month, phase IIIb, open-label study. Patients with active mCNV were treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg according to the European label. The study assessed local criteria in Italy driving retreatment decisions with ranibizumab; and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ranibizumab. Result(s): The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of treated patients (N = 200) was 61.8 (12.7) years; range 22-85 years. The multivariate regression model indicated that presence of active leakage (odds ratio [OR] 95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.30 [1.03-124.14]), presence of intraretinal fluid (OR [95%CI]: 28.21 [1.55-513.73]), and an improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline < 10 letters (OR [95%CI]: 17.60 [1.39-222.75]) were the factors with the greatest effect on retreatment with ranibizumab. The mean (SD) BCVA gain from baseline to month 12 was 8.4 (12.8) letters (P < 0.0001). The mean (SD) number of injections was 2.41 (1.53); range 1-9. Ocular and non-ocular adverse events were reported in 41 (20.5%) and 30 (15.0%) patients, respectively. Conclusion(s): Individualized treatment with ranibizumab was effective in improving BCVA in patients with mCNV over 12 months. Both anatomical and functional variables had significant effects on causing retreatment. There were no new safety findings.

N2  - Purpose: To compare chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) progression in myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) between intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (IVR) and aflibercept (IVA) in the eyes with mCNV. Method(s): Thirty eyes (28 patients) with treatment-naive mCNV were included in this study. IVR or IVA was administered for up to 1 year. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured, and fundus photographs and fundus autofluorescence were obtained before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the initial treatment. The clinical characteristics including the macular choroidal thickness in various areas and CRA progression were compared between the drugs. The clinical characteristics and macular choroidal thicknesses were compared between eyes with and without CRA progression. Result(s): The BCVA improved significantly (p < 0.05 for all comparisons) from 0.44 to 0.26, 0.19, 0.20, and 0.17 after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. CRA progressed in 12 (40%) eyes over 1 year. The CRA progression did not differ significantly between aflibercept and ranibizumab. The foveal choroid was significantly (p = 0.0043) thinner in aflibercept-treated eyes compared with ranibizumab-treated eyes at 1 year. Subfoveal CNV tended to cause CRA progression more frequently at 1 year, although this did not reach significance. Conclusion(s): IVA to treat mCNV caused more severe thinning of the foveal choroid than ranibizumab; however, no significant difference was seen in CRA progression between the drugs and the choroidal thickness should not be associated with CRA progression. The CNV location may predict CRA progression after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for mCNV.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).

N2  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a high profile disruptive technology that has vast potential to impact on medicine and healthcare. In the past few years, a sub-set of AI technology, known as deep learning (DL), has generated significant interest and shown substantial potential to be used to address a range of healthcare and clinical problems. The application of AI and DL techniques in ophthalmology have been increasing, and include screening and diagnosis of major eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma, applied to datasets that include retinal photographs, optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and clinical data. Compared to older technology using traditional 'pattern recognition' techniques to detect specific patterns, DL uses much larger datasets and a convoluted neural networks (CNN or 'black box') approach to mine, extract and learn patterns and/or features to determine a disease state or condition. Recently, researchers from Google using DL learning technology have reported high sensitivity and specificity in detecting referable DR from retinal photographs, and another group has had a DL algorithm for DR screening that has had FDA approval. For translational impact, AI and DL technology should be validated in 'real-world' clinical settings, where datasets and images have varying qualities, and in patient populations of different characteristics and ethnicity. Even as AI technology evolves and becomes increasingly popular, with performance approaching and surpassing human-level specialists performance, there remain significant technical, clinical and medico-legal challenges in the field, including overcoming 'black box' phenomenon, which may prevent AI and DL systems from easy translation from the laboratory to real-world clinical practice, and patient and physician acceptance issues. There continues to be myths surrounding AI. Understanding these issues and challenges are critical for physicians, researchers, health administrators and policy makers to embrace and use AI in ophthalmology. Brief Curriculum Vitae: Prof Wong is Provost Chair Professor of Ophthalmology and Medical Director of SNEC, one of the largest tertiary eye hospital in Asia. Prof Wong was previously Executive Director of the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI), Chair of the Department of Ophthalmology at the National University of Singapore, Head of the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Melbourne and Managing Director of the Centre for Eye Research Australia (CERA). Prof Wong is a retinal specialist with a clinical practice focusing on major retinal diseases including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and myopic macular degeneration. He has a broad-based research program comprising epidemiological, clinical and translational studies of these retinal diseases, and the use of retinal imaging to predict disease risk. He has published >1000 peer-reviewed papers, including papers in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet, and given >300 invited plenary, symposium and named lectures globally. He has received >US$50 million in grant funding as Principal Investigator. Prof Wong has been recognized nationally and internationally with numerous awards, such as the Sandra Doherty Award from the American Heart Association, the Alcon Research Institute Award, the Novartis Prize in Diabetes, the Australian Commonwealth Health Minister's Award, and the Arnall Patz Medal from the Macula Society. He received the National Clinician Scientist Award, the President's Science Award and the President's Science and Technology Award, the highest awards for scientific contribution in Singapore.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of conbercept versus ranibizumab in treating myopic CNV from China payer's perspective. Method(s): A Markov model, based on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) letters, was developed to simulate the progression of myopic CNV and to predict the outcomes of conbercept and ranibizumab treatment over life-time. Disease progression was characterized by a series of health states referred to as 90, 75, 60, 45, and 30 BCVA letters. A patient's BCVA was assumed to either increase by 30 letters, increase by 15 letters, remain the same, decrease by 15 letters or decrease by 30 letters each 3-month length cycle. The first-year transition probabilities of conbercept and ranibizumab were estimated based on clinical trials on Chinese population, i.e. SHINY for conbercept and BRILLIANCE for ranibizumab, respectively. The long-term visual prognosis was assumed the same in both arms based on literatures. The number of injections in two arms were either from the clinical trials (scenario 1) or from real-world studies (scenario 2). Utilities and cost data (including drug cost, costs associated with health states and costs of managing adverse events) were mainly derived from literatures or previous studies. Both one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted on selected key parameters. Result(s): In scenario 1, the total costs and QALYs of conbercept were 180,207 and 9.86 while that of ranibizumab were 175,955 and 9.83, respectively. Conbercept was cost-effective under the threshold of 3 times GDP per capita. In scenario 2, the QALYs remained the same and the total costs of conbercept was lower than ranibizumab (163,987 vs 164,923), making conbercept a dominant choice. PSA indicated that the probability of conbercept being cost-effective in two scenarios were 53.0% and 66.3%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Compared with ranibizumab, conbercept had similar total costs and QALYs while PSA demonstrated a slightly higher level of cost-effectiveness.Copyright © 2019

N2  - Purpose: To examine the person-specific cumulative 6-year incidence and progression of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) and associated risk factors in Singapore. Method(s): We analysed data from phakic adults who attended the baseline (aged >=40 years, 2004-2011) and 6-year follow-up (2011-2017) visits of a population-based longitudinal study (Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study). Eye examinations, including subjective refraction and axial length (AL) were done. MMD was graded using the META-PM classification from fundus photographs. Incidence of MMD was defined as development of MMD (Meta-PM category 2, 3 or 4) during follow up in those without MMD at baseline and progression of MMD as worsening of MMD in those with pre-existing MMD. Result(s): In 8,716 phakic persons at baseline, 6,080 (69.8%) were re-examined. Of these, 6,030 (99.2%) had gradable fundus photographs and were analysed. Of 6030, 35.8% had myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] <=-0.5 diopters [D]) and 6.4% had high myopia (SE <=-5.0 D), respectively, with 2,009 at risk of MMD development. Mean baseline age (+/-SD) was 56.1+/-8.7 years (28.9% Malays, 32.1% Indians and 39.0% Chinese). The 6-year incidence of MMD was 1.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.3%). Of the 35 new MMD cases (42 eyes), 33 (40 eyes), 2 (2 eyes) and 1 (1 eye) had incident diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy and lacquer cracks, respectively. Among 202 persons with MMD at baseline, the 6-year progression of MMD was 17.3% (95% CI, 12.1-22.6%) and stable MMD was seen in 167 (82.7%). Of 35 persons (49 eyes) with MMD progression, 4 (6 eyes) progressed from Meta-PM category 2 to 3 with new patchy chorioretinal atrophy; 24 (35 eyes) had enlargement of existing diffuse chorioretinal atrophy; 7 (7 eyes) had enlargement of existing patchy chorioretinal atrophy; 4 (4 eyes) had widening lacquer cracks; and 3 (5 eyes) had new lacquer cracks. Having tessellated fundus at baseline predicted MMD development at 6 years (P<0.001). Older age (P<0.001), worse SE (P=0.005) and longer AL (P=0.002) was associated with MMD incidence. Having peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation (P=0.004), worse SE (P=0.03) and longer AL (P=0.009) was associated with MMD progression. Conclusion(s): In the 6-year period, MMD was stable in majority of older adults in Singapore, with a low incidence of MMD (1.7%) and relatively low progression (17.3%) in those with existing MMD.

N2  - Purpose: To examine the progression of myopia in highly myopic Singaporean children from childhood to young adulthood. This site uses cookies. By continuing to use our website, you are agreeing to our privacy policy.  Accept Methods: We included Chinese, Malay and Indian children (n=106, 90% Chinese, 56% male) from three schools who participated in the Singapore Cohort Study of Risk Factors for Myopia (SCORM) with high myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] <= -5 diopters [D]). Cycloplegic refraction and biometry were performed at baseline (aged 7-9 years), every year for 9 years until last adolescent follow-up (aged 12-17), and a subsequent ten-year follow-up (aged 21-27). Fundus photography and choroidal thickness from swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) were analyzed at the last follow-up. Myopia progression was defined as mean annual change in SE. Result(s): The mean baseline age was 7.8 years. SE (mean +/- SD) at baseline, last adolescent visit, and 19-year adult visit were -2.81 +/- 1.85, -6.69 +/- 1.26 and -7.01 +/- 1.56, respectively. Myopia progression and axial length change from baseline to adolescence (-0.58 +/- 0.25 D/year, 0.21 +/- 0.08 mm/year) were both significantly higher compared to adolescence to young adulthood (-0.03 +/- 0.08 D/year, 0.04 +/- 0.04 mm/year respectively, both P<0.001). In multivariate linear regression models, baseline SE was associated with earlier age of onset of myopia, myopia progression from baseline to adolescence, and more severe adult SE (all P<0.001), but not with myopia progression from adolescence to young adulthood (P=0.32). Adolescent and young adult SE were associated with both decreased choroidal thickness and presence of tessellated fundus (both P<0.001) at last follow-up. Conclusion(s): Children with high myopia progress more rapidly from childhood to adolescence than from adolescence to young adulthood, with minimal progression after adolescence. Children with early onset myopia and greater severity of baseline myopia have faster myopia progression through adolescence and more severe adult myopia. More severe adolescent and adult myopia is associated with thinner choroidal thickness and presence of tessellated fundus, features which have been associated with myopic macular degeneration. Treatment of early onset myopes with increased risk of developing myopic macular degeneration would need to occur during earlier phases of life.

N2  - Purpose : Automated methods for assessing choroidal vasculature are surprisingly limited. This work aims to develop an automated method that accurately segments the choroid and provides choroidal vasculature information from 3D OCT scans without the necessity of OCT angiography. We propose 2D and 3D metrics for choroidal vasculature: choroidal vessel area intensity (VAD), choroid vessel volume (CVV), choroid stroma volume (CSV), choroidal vessel volume density (VVD) and choroidal stroma-to-vessel volume ratio (SVR). Methods : SS-OCT imaging (PLEX Elite 9000 (ZEISS, Dublin, CA)) was used to collect 12x12 mm macular scans from subjects. The steps for automatic 3D segmentation of choroid included: 1) attenuation correction; 2) excluding optic disc; and 3) graph search for Bruch's membrane and the outer border of choroidal vessels. The 2D choroidal vasculature map was obtained using minimum en face projection. The 3D choroidal vessels were segmented on each B-scan in the whole volume scan. From the segmented 3D choroidal vessels, the metrics of mean choroid thickness (MCT), VAD, CVV, CSV, VVD and SVR were investigated in 2D or 3D (Fig. 1). Results : 144 normal subjects were recruited with at least 20 subjects from each decade ranging from 20s to 80s. The automatic choroid segmentations assisted by attenuation correction were validated with manual segmentations and showed good agreement on all metrics (all P<0.0001). VAD, CVV and CSV showed significant correlations with choroid thickness (all P < 0.0001). Interestingly, VVD and SVR were constant with small variations among all subjects (68.9+/-1.3% and 0.45+/-0.03). Age-related distributions of choroid thickness and metrics for choroidal vessels from the normal database were also analyzed. All choroid-related metrics were significantly correlated with age (all P<0.0001) except VVD and SVR (Fig.2). Conclusions : The proposed automated choroidal assessments of thickness and vasculature were successful in both 2D and 3D OCT scans, which will be clinically useful in quantitative investigations of ocular diseases involving the choroid such as AMD, central serous chorioretinopathy, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and pathologic myopia.

N2  - Purpose : To report the prevalence of axial length (AL) myopia and hyperopia in Mexican patients that underwent cataract surgery during 2014 in various cities of Mexico, as well as to evaluate this measurement as a possible risk factor for developing certain ocular pathologies. Methods : A retrospective multicentric study was executed for which we included all patients that were programmed to undergo cataract surgery during 2014. We analyzed keratometric and axial length measurements, which were taken with interferometry as in IOL Master 500 or ultrasound A-mode with immersion technique. Groups were made according to their risk factors: Patients with risk of miscalculation of IOL were divided in AL>26 mm or AL<22 mm; for risk of posterior capsule rupture during surgery it was considered AL>28 mm. As for definitions of high myopia it was considered an AL>26 mm and pathologic myopia AL>30 mm; on the other hand, hyperopia was considered AL<22 mm and microphtalmos AL<20.5 mm. Results : The study was performed in 3046 eyes of 2348 patients. The mean age was 68.01+/-11.97 years old. 55.9% of patients (1704) were women and in 53.1% (1617) the right eye was studied.The mean AL was 23.52+/-1.56 mm (range from 18.00 to 34.25 mm) and the most used technique was ultrasound in 56.1% (1709 eyes) of the cases. About 14.3% (436 patients) of the cases presented an AL <=22 mm or >=26 mm. The mean corneal keratometric power was 43.81+/-1.80 D (range from 38.25 to 49.60 D). The most utilized equipment for this measurement was the auto-refractometer. The risk factor distribution was as seen in the following charts attached: Conclusions : Our study revealed that most of our patients had an AL between 22 and 26 mm, as previously reported in the literature. However, the percentage of patients that were included in AL myopia and hyperopia did show more complications associated to extreme AL, specially in longer AL as pathologic myopia. Due to our results, we consider that it is mandatory to adjust parameters and to consider special circumstances in these patients during cataract surgery and, most importantly, during IOL calculation using specialized formulas in order to minimize IOL miscalculation and complications associated to extreme AL.

N2  - Purpose : The global burden of myopia is significant, and increasing. Patients with high myopia are at increased risk of vision-threatening complications, including myopic macular degeneration (MMD). We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) based deep learning system (DLS) using fundus photographs to predict refractive error, high myopia, and MMD. Methods : The DLS consisted of a convolutional neural network (DenseNet) pre-trained with XGBoost algorithm, developed using retinal images from a multiethnic populationbased cohort: the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) cohort, with 15,876 (12,703 for training, 3,173 for testing) and 16,793 (13,433 for training, 3,360 for testing) images used for prediction of refractive error and MMD respectively. Images were classified by professional graders according to the International Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) classification into 5 categories (grades 0 to 4), with MMD defined as category 2 or worse. The DLS was assessed in its ability to (1) predict spherical equivalent (SE), (2) detect high myopia (SE <= -6.00D), and (3) detect MMD. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was determined for these classifications. Results : The DLS was able to predict SE with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.20D. The AUC, sensitivity and specificity (at the specified threshold) for detection of high myopia were 0.942, 91.7% and 83.5% respectively. The AUC, sensitivity and specificity for detection of MMD were 0.955, 91.9% and 87.7% respectively. The ROC curves are shown in Figure 1. Conclusions : Using fundus photographs, the DLS developed was able to predict refractive error, and detect high myopia and MMD with a high degree of accuracy. Application of this DLS in screening programs could allow early identification of patients at high-risk for vision-threatening complications of myopia. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Purpose : To evaluate the contribution of some of the most important SNPs associated to high myopia in Asians to the development of myopic maculopathy (MM) in an European population. Methods : A case-control prospective study with 250 unrelated highly myopic Spanish Caucasian patients and 181 non-myopic controls were recruited from various centers of OFTARED (RD16/0008). Highly myopic patients were divided into two groups. One group with MM category 0 or 1 at least in one eye, which was used as myopic maculopathy control; and the other group, with MM category 2, 3, 4 or any "plus" lesion, according to Ohno-Matsui et al and Ruiz-Medrano et al classification systems. Genomic DNA was extracted from oral swabs. A set of 6 SNPs in 5 genes were genotyped by Real-time PCR using validated TaqMan assays: SCO2 (rs74315510), CCDC102B (rs11873439) Cromosome 15 (rs634990), PAX6 (rs644242) and BLID (rs577948). Univariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, cholesterol, diabetes and hypertension was performed for each allele and genotype frequency analysis. Results : All the studied SNPs were in Hardy-weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). The allelic and genotype frequencies of all studied SNPs did not show statistical differences (p>0.05) between MM group and control groups. Conclusions : None of the studied SNPs associated in the development of high myopia and myopic maculopathy in Asiatic populations showed any relation with the development of myopic maculopathy in an European cohort. The relationship between genotype/race seems to be very important along with environmental factors in the development of this disease.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the relationship between the presence of posterior staphyloma (PS) and the choroidal thickness in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) without high myopia. Method(s): Retrospective observational study including 77 eyes of 39 patients with RP and an axial length inferior to 25 mm. All participants had relatively preserved macular area and underwent fundus photography, A and B echography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). PS was defined by an outward bowing of the sclera on the SS-OCT images. The relationship between the PS and SS-OCT layers thicknesses was determined. Result(s): The study identified 17 eyes of 9 patients with a PS. Eleven eyes had narrow macular staphyloma (NMS) and six had large macular staphyloma (LMS).

Accmeepatn choroidal thickness (CT) was 185.7 +/-71 um versus 259.7 um in patients without PS. We found a significant association between PS and CT in our RP patients (p=0,003) but not with visual acuity, years of progression, retinal layers or FAF findings. The average CT was significantly thinner in both NMS (p=0,01) and LMS (p=0,04) patients compared to patients without PS. Conclusion(s): PS seems to be quiet common in nonhighly myopic eyes with RP. Also, like staphylomas in highly myopic eyes, it shows a marked thinning of the choroid in comparison with eyes without PS. This might suggest the possibility that choroidal thinning in an important factor for staphyloma formation also in RP patients.

N2  - Purpose: The multicenter, longitudinal HELP observational study prospectively investigates the natural course of pathological myopia in Caucasians. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the development and progression of atrophy areas. Method(s): One hundred and fifty subjects (age: 57.2 (+/- 12.7) years) were recruited in 25 centers across Germany between 2014 and 2016. Main inclusion criteria included axial length> 26 mm, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) > 0.05 and the presence of at least one of five pre-defined morphological risk factors in the study eye approved by the independent central reading center (CRC). At baseline and annual visits, the presence and localisation of atrophy in study and non-study eye were determined by multimodal imaging including color fundus photography (three-field imaging), fundus autofluorescence (two-field imaging), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (central 30 degree field) by the CRC. If possible, area size was quantified using RegionFinder software and the enlargement rate of atrophy over the time was determinted for up to three atrophy areas per eye, provided individual spots were completely covered within the field of view. (German Clinical Trial Register DRKS00007761). Result(s): At least one atrophic area was present in 82 eyes of 61 (40.6%) patients at baseline, of which 26 eyes presenting more than three lesions. In 58 eyes, atrophy areas were completely detected within two-field fundus autofluorescence imaging, while in the remaining 24 eyes the atrophy areas partially exceeded the edge of the image field. Mean size of single atrophic spots was 1.29 mm2 (range, 0.01-11.07 mm2) and mean total lesion size per eye was 1.90 (0.05-31.03 mm2), respectively. On average, atrophy areas increased by 0.24 mm2/year (0-1.93 mm2) in the first, by 0.2 mm2/year (0-1.33 mm2) in the second and by 0.21 mm2/year (0-1.19 mm2) in the third year. Conclusion(s): The progression of atrophic areas in pathological myopia can be quantified by multimodal imaging. The annual enlargement rate is highly variable and markedly lower compared to the progression of geographic atrophy associated with age-related macular degeneration.

N2  - Purpose: Retinal complications are the most important cause of visual decline in high myopia. The most established classification system to diagnose these lesions is META-PM, but this was developed mainly on Asian eyes. Here, we evaluated the performance of the META-PM classification in European eyes, assessed the relation with visual acuity and investigated potential ethnical differences. Method(s): A total of 451 patients with high myopia (spherical equivalent (SphE)<-6 D) from the Dutch MYST study were extensively examined using visual function tests and multimodal imaging. With the META-PM grading system, we analysed the type, extent and location of retinal complications on funduscopic photographs. We computed a complication score based on staphyloma, various myopic macular changes, myopic peripapillary atrophy (MPA), and/or a peripapillary intrachorideal cavitation (score range 0-4). We calculated correlation coefficients between parameters and visual acuity (Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs), for normally distributed and skewed data, respectively), and applied unpaired t-tests to assess differences in visual acuity between complication locations. Result(s): The mean age of the participants was 45.8 +/- 13.0 years, the percentage men 36.4% and mean SphE was-10.36D +/- 3.26. The most frequent lesion was MPA (62.0%) followed by staphyloma (21.4%). For comparison, the prevalence of MPA in Asians was reported to be 81.2% and of staphyloma was 23%. Foveal involvement of the staphyloma was present in 55.1% and was associated with decreased visual acuity (BCVA with vs. without foveal involvement 0.60+/-0.37 vs 0.85+/-0.28 (P=1,25E-06)). The occurrence of active CNV or Fuchs spot was rare (0.56% and 1.11% for CNV and Fuchs spot respectively). A significant correlation was observed between complication score and mean SphE (rs=-0.428, P= 3,36E-21), mean axial length (rs= 0.567, P= 8,03E-39) and age (rs= 0.297, P= 1,76E-10). This was in line with a significant trend (P<0.001) of more complications with lower spherical equivalent, longer axial length and higher age reported in Asians Conclusion(s): The META-PM grading system enabled reliable identification and quantification of retinal complications due to myopia in Europeans.The frequency of complications was in line with that of Asians, albeit a slightly lower prevalence of MPA. Awareness of the morbidity of high myopia should be present around the globe.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the effect of age of myopia onset, environmental factors and a myopia genetic risk score on refractive error, axial length and high myopia Methods: Studies in the Consortium for Refractive Error and Myopia (CREAM) with data on age of myopia onset, refractive error, and ocular biometry at adolescent or early adult examination, together with environmental factors and genetic loci for refractive error were included. Data from individuals with conditions that could alter refraction were excluded. The effect of the above factors were considered separately and collectively in multivariable regression models: Dependent variable = beta0 + beta1 Age of myopia onset + beta2 Age at visit + beta3 gender + beta4 genetic risk score + beta5 outdoor + beta6 nearwork Three outcomes were considered-spherical equivalent (SE), axial length (AL) adjusted for height, and the dichotomous outcome of high (SE <-5.0D) vs mild to moderate myopia (SE <-0.5D). A fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed with sub-analysis by age at visit and ethnicity. Result(s): Complete phenotypic and genotypic data from four European and two Asian studies were included in the meta-analysis (n=1947). In a basic model age of myopia onset, adjusted for age at visit and sex, was significantly associated with both SE (beta 0.13, 95% CI 0.11-0.15)and high myopia (odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.87-0.90). When the genetic risk score and environmental factors were included in the full model, age of onset remained significant with a comparable effect for both SE (beta 0.10, 95% CI 0.08-0.12) and high myopia (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96). Total SE variance explained ranged from 0.06 to 0.54 in the basic and 0.09 to 0.54 in the full model. Mean area under the curve statistics in high myopia models ranged from 0.55 to 0.92 in the basic and 0.61 to 0.93 in the full model, with higher estimates in studies comprised of older participants. Age of myopia onset was significantly associated with axial length in all studies but this became non-significant in the meta-analysis Conclusion(s): Age of myopia onset was a significant determinant of SE, AL and high myopia. In explanatory models, only moderate benefit was gained incorporating genetic and environmental factors compared to age of myopia onset alone. This is clinically relevant-early onset myopia is most likely to progress to high myopia, andpotentially, visually disabling pathologic myopia in later life.

N2  - Purpose: Knowledge of the effects of non-pathological factors on VF sensitivity in normal eyes is a prerequisite in diagnosing eyes with pathology. Two non-pathological factors, myopia-associated factors and aging, are known to affect VF sensitivity in normal eyes, but our knowledge of how these two affect it is not detailed enough. We studied the effects of these 2 factors in a cross-sectional group (C) and longitudinal group (L) of normal subjects. Method(s): The C included 1022 eyes of 539 subjects (mean age=52.7 yr.) that were confirmed to be normal without clinically significant cataract with refractive error < +3 and >-6 diopters, axial length (AL) < 26 mm, BCVA >1.0, reliable HFA 24-2 SITA-S (HFA 24-2) results with FL < 20% and FP < 15%, and acceptable fundus planimetric results. The C was divided into the younger and older C at an age of 53 yrs. The L included 109 eyes of 59 normal subjects (mean age=52.3 yrs.) who satisfied the above criteria and were followed at intervals of 3-6 months without developing any ocular abnormalities. HFA 24-2 VF was divided into the fovea, central VF (VFc) including ceco-central 6 points and peripheral VF (VFp) excluding VFc and nasal 4 points. The mean sensitivity in each subfield in the C or its time change in the L was analyzed with linear mixed modeled regression analysis using age, rim area, AL, beta-peripapillary atrophy area (beta-PPA) and disc ovality and torsion angle as co-variables. Result(s): In the older C, age showed negative impact on the mean sensitivity in all subfields (-0.12 +/- 0.01 (SE) ~-0.11 +/- 0.02 dB/yr., P<0.001) with no significant inter-subfield differences. Besides age, beta-PPA showed negative impact (-0.20 +/- 0.09 dB/mm2, P=0.029) only in the VFc. In the L, duration showed negative impact in all subfields (-0.009 +/- 0.002 ~-0.007 +/- 0.001 dB/yr., P<0.001) with no significant inter-subfield differences. Interaction of duration with age was significant (P<0.001) in all subfields, but that with beta-PPA only in the VFp (P=0.016). Conclusion(s): Aging-related VF sensitivity reduction was accelerated independent of the eccentricity. Besides age, only beta-PPA had significantly negative impact on the central VF sensitivity, but its effect on the aging-related VF sensitivity reduction was more evident in the peripheral VF.

T1  - Axial length changes in healthy adult eyes

N2  - Purpose: It is generally assumed that, barring pathological myopia, axial length in healthy adults remains constant. Several authors, however, reported an axial length decrease with age. Since a stable outcome for laser surgery and intraocular lens calculations require that a constant axial length, this work analyses the factors that influence axial length measurements over the age of 20. Method(s): Based on a literature review several influences were identified: cohort effects (myopization of young people), measurement bias (changes in the lens gradient index and thickness), and physiological processes. The importance of each effect on axial length measurement was calculated using the Atchison aging eye model. Result(s): In the literature we identified 15 cross-sectional studies of axial length changes with age, of which 10 showed a significant decrease, 4 showed no change and 1 showed a significant increase. Combined, these studies suggest an age-related change in axial length by-6.4 mu m/year. This cannot be due to measurement bias, since, assuming a fixed axial length, calculations with the Atchison eye model suggest that between 20-80 years of age, axial length measurements will appear to increase by +1.07 mu m/year due to lens index and thickness changes. In the presence of cataract this bias would increase further by + 1 mu m per increment of 0.01 in refractive index. At the same time the choroidal thickness shrinks by 2.98 mu m/year (Wakatsuki et al. PLoS One, 2015;10:e0144156), increasing the axial length by the same amount. Considering the axial length change as a function of year of birth, however, the axial growth curves of Western countries (which had a similar economic development during the 20th Century) lined up to one another. This fit improved considerably when including the mean education of the countries of the studies (based on UN data) and the curves of all data sets, both Western and non-Western, lined up even further (r2 = 0.681; p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Given the cross-sectional nature of all studies considered, the strong correlation between an increase in education level and an increase in axial length (as well as myopia), the reported axial length decreases with age are almost certainly the result of a cohort effect.

N2  - Purpose : Automated methods for assessing choroidal vasculature in the whole 3D scanning volume are surprisingly limited. This work aims to develop an automated method that accurately segments choroidal vessels from 3D OCT scans, without the necessity of OCT angiography. We propose a depth-resolved mapping for choroid vessels and 3D metrics for choroidal vasculature quantification: choroid vessel volume (CVV), choroid stroma volume (CSV), choroidal vessel volume density (VVD) and choroidal stroma-tovessel volume ratio (SVR). Methods : SS-OCT (PlexElite, Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc.) was used to collect 12x12mm macular scans from subjects. The steps for automated segmentation of choroid slab include: 1) attenuation correction; 2) excluding optic disc; 3) graph search for Bruch's membrane and the outer border of choroidal vessels. The 3D choroidal vessels were segmented on each B-scan of the segmented slab. From the binarized 3D choroidal vessels, en face sum projections were generated with color map indicating the depth of the vessel from Bruch's membrane and montaged to large field-of-view. Metrics of mean choroid thickness (MCT), CVV, CSV, VVD and SVR were investigated in 3D (Fig. 1). Results : 144 normal subjects were recruited. The automatic choroid segmentations assisted by attenuation correction were validated with manual segmentations and showed good agreement on all metrics (all P<0.0001). Depth-resolved mapping of segmented 3D choroidal vessels presented vessels at different depth with different color in ultra-large field-of-view (15x20mm) (Fig.2). CVV and CSV showed significant correlations with choroid thickness (all P<0.0001). VVD and SVR were constant with small variations among all subjects (68.9+/-1.3% and 0.45+/-0.03). All choroid-related metrics were significantly correlated with age (all P<0.0001) except VVD and SVR. Conclusions : The proposed automated choroid assessment on thickness and vasculature was successful in 3D OCT scans, which will be clinically useful in quantitative assessment of a myriad of ocular diseases involving the choroid such as AMD, central serous chorioretinopathy, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and pathologic myopia.

N2  - Introduction: Dome-shaped macula was originally defined as a convexity of the macula in the setting of a posterior staphyloma, and is associated with high myopia and vision loss in adults. This morphology has never been described in the pediatric population. Method(s): This is a prospective, observational study of premature infants screened for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) between June 2015 and June 2017 with 9-month follow-up. Handheld spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging was performed in addition to indirect ophthalmoscopy. Two trained graders identified retinal convexity on two sides of the fovea. A third trained grader mediated disagreements. Result(s): This study included 39 infants (49% male, mean gestational age 28.0 weeks, mean birth weight 963.3 grams). Agreement between OCT graders was 95.8% (kappa = 0.94). In total, 24/39 (62%) had dome-shaped macula in at least one eye (13 both eyes, 5 right eye only, and 6 left eye only). Comparing 18/39 (46.2%) right eyes with dome-shaped macula to those without, a lower birth weight (860 g vs 1052 g; P = 0.03) and a borderline lower gestational age (P = 0.09) and best-corrected visual acuity at 9 months (P = 0.07) were seen, as well as a borderline association with the presence of ROP (P = 0.06). No associations with sex, race, OCT-determined cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane, vitreous bands, punctate opacities, ROP severity, or cycloplegic spherical equivalence at 9 months were seen. Discussion(s): Future investigations are necessary to demonstrate long-term impact of dome-shaped macula on vision and emmetropization. Conclusion(s): Dome-shaped macula is an incidental handheld SD-OCT finding with high prevalence among premature infants, especially those with lower birth weight.Copyright © 2019

N2  - The appearance of tessellated fundus in an eye may act as a marker in identifying visual performance, degree of myopia or risk of progression of myopia in a given eye. A systematic literature search using key words was performed using PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar and of the 832 studies identified, 10 full-length articles, which met the inclusion criteria, were considered for review. The primary outcome measures were association of tessellated fundus with: (i) visual acuity, (ii) refractive error, (iii) axial length, (iv) choroidal thickness and (v) future progression of myopia when compared to either no myopic maculopathy, or more severe myopic maculopathy. There was no significant difference in the visual acuity noted between eyes with normal fundus and tessellated fundus appearance. Compared to eyes with tessellated fundus, eyes with more severe myopic maculopathy had a four-line decrease in best-corrected visual acuity, more myopia (mean difference 2.75 D, range 0.28-5.78 D) and a longer axial length (mean difference 2mm, range 2.29 to 1.71mm). Eyes with tessellated fundus generally exhibited a significant decrease in choroidal thickness compared to eyes with no maculopathy. In mostly older individuals, eyes with tessellated fundus had a better outcome with respect to visual acuity, degree of myopia and axial length compared to other severe myopic maculopathies, but had a worse outcome for choroidal thickness and degree of myopia, compared to eyes with no myopic maculopathy. The features such as reduced choroidal thickness combined with a predilection to infra-temporal and parapapillary regions may indicate regions of stress that are prone to more stretching/atrophic changes. This systematic review demonstrated an association of tessellated fundus with visual acuity, refractive error, axial length and choroidal thickness and hence emphasises the documentation of the presence and location of tessellated fundus appearance that may help in predicting the progression of myopia.Copyright © 2018 Optometry Australia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK (FS-LASIK) can make ultra-thin corneal flap accurately. MEL 90 excimer laser provides Triple-A ablation mode, which significantly reduces the amount of corneal tissue cutting. This study aimed to investigate the visual and refractive outcomes in patients with high myopia after thin-flap FS-LASIK using the 500Hz pulse rate of the Triple-A profile. METHOD(S): This prospective study included 90 eyes from 90 patients received thin-flap FS-LASIK using the 500Hz pulse rate of the Triple-A profile. According to the pre-operative spherical equivalence (SE), the treated eyes were divided into two groups: the first group (ranged from -9.0D to -6.0D) and the second group (ranged from -11.15D to -9.0 D). The parameters evaluated pre-operatively and 6month post-operatively included uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), SE, efficacy and safety index, posterior central elevation, and corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs). RESULT(S): The efficacy indexes were 1.149+/-0.150 for the first group and 1.173+/-0.136 for the second group (P>0.05), whereas safety indexes were 1.135+/-0.154 and 1.158+/-0.137 (P>0.05) respectively. Moreover, 93.8 and 90.6% of patients had an UDVA of 20/20, 51.2 and 49.8% had a UDVA of 20/16 for the first and second groups, respectively; yet, there were no significant differences between both groups at the 20/20 and the 20/16 levels (P>0.05). 84 and 100% of the firse group patients had a SE within +/-0.5 D and+/-1.0 D, and 82 and 100% of the second group patients. There was no significant myopia regression in both groups after 6months follow-up. At 1, 3 and 6-month after surgery, there were no significant differences in the posterior central elevation between the two groups (P>0.05). The induction of total HOAs, spherical aberration, and horizontal coma in the first group were significantly less than that in the second group at the 6- month follow-up (P<0.05), while the differences of the RMS value of vertical coma between both groups were not significant (P>0.05). The ablation was significantly associated with the post-operative increase in total HOAs, spherical aberration and horizontal coma (P<0.05),but not with vertical coma (P>0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicate that using the Triple-A ablation profile of the MEL 90 excimer laser associated with thin-flap is a safe, efficient, and predictable method to correct SE up to -11.15D. However, for patients with high myopia, under the premise of ensuring a certain optical zone diameter, the ablation depth should be minimized to reduce the increase of the post-operative HOAs so as to improve the visual quality.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To measure the decentration following SMILE in eyes with high myopic astigmatism and investigate its impact on visual quality. METHOD(S): The prospective study was conducted to analyze patients who underwent SMILE for correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism >=2.5D (high astigmatism group, HA) at the ophthalmology department, Eye and ENT hospital, Shanghai, China.. Patients with myopic astigmatism <1.5D served as controls (low astigmatism group, LA). Decentration was measured using a Scheimpflug camera with a difference map of the tangential curvature at 12months postoperatively. Also the associations between decentration from the coaxial sighted corneal light reflex (CSCLR) and the visual outcomes, correction efficacy of astigmatism, wavefront aberrations and objective scatter index (OSI) were analyzed. RESULT(S): No significant differences were observed in the decentered distance between HA and LA in either eyes (OD: HA: 0.18+/-0.10mm, LA: 0.20+/-0.14mm, P =0.659; OS: HA: 0.22+/-0.11mm, LA: 0.20+/-0.11mm, P =0.637). The analysis across the three levels of decentration (<0.1mm, 0.1-0.2mm, and>0.2mm) showed no significant association between decentration and visual outcomes of predictability, efficiency, safety, MTF cutoff, OSI, SR and OVs in both groups. Also no significant association was observed between decentration and postoperative astigmatism in either group. A significant relationship between the magnitude of decentration and induced coma and spherical aberration was observed in HA. CONCLUSION(S): The amount of decentration between HA and LA groups showed no differences. Decentration >0.20mm from CSCLR resulted in greater induction of coma and SA after SMILE in eyes with HA.

N2  - A 54-year-old patient presented with cataract, 5 years after undergoing SMILE for high myopia in both eyes. He was motivated in achieving spectacle free vision and his post SMILE-induced aberrations were minimal, due to which he was found suitable for a trifocal IOL implant. Of the various methods considered, the IOL power predicted by a novel combined telecentric keratometry and swept source OCT-based method was finally selected. One month post-operatively, the patient achieved a binocular UDVA of 20/20p and near vision of N.6, suggesting that newer IOL formulae could be superior in providing satisfactory outcomes in post refractive patients.

N2  - Purpose: To report a single case history of scleral rupture (SR) during silicone oil injection in a pars plana vitrectomy. Observations: A 60-year-old woman with a history of pathological myopia presented with acute vision loss in her right eye. A retinal detachment, with multiple tears, was diagnosed, and she underwent vitreoretinal surgery. During silicone oil injection, a SR, with extra ocular oil leakage, was advised. Due to the small extent of the lacerated area, the SR was left to spontaneously resolve and, after three surgeries, the retina remained attached, with no internal tamponade, and the patient had not presented symptoms or signs of intracranial migration or toxicity. Conclusions and importance: During silicone oil injection, it is most important to maintain a controlled eyeball pressure, especially in patients with scleral weakness, and to carefully check the drainage of air, due to the risk of SR. When oil leakage is detected in the orbital cavity, an accurate assessment may be required due to the likelihood of progression inside the intracranial structures.Copyright © 2019 The Authors

N2  - Purpose To characterize and provide population-based prevalence estimates of myopic degeneration (MD) among Chinese Americans, the fastest-growing minority population in the United States in the last decade. Design Population-based, cross-sectional study. Methods A total of 1523 Chinese-American adults with myopia, aged 50 years and older, residing in the city of Monterey Park, California, underwent an interview and comprehensive eye examination, including subjective and objective refraction and stereoscopic fundus photography. For each participant, the eye with the worse myopic refractive error was included in this analysis. MD was assessed in a masked manner by an expert grader. Results The prevalence of any MD was 44.9% among myopic subjects, based on the presence of any degenerative lesion secondary to myopia. The prevalence was 32.2% when MD was defined by a modified version of the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia. The prevalence of specific lesions included tessellation (31.7%), tilted disc (28.1%), peripapillary atrophy (7.0%), staphyloma (5.7%), diffuse atrophy (6.4%), lacquer cracks (2.6%), intrachoroidal cavitation (2.2%), patchy atrophy (0.9%), and end-stage MD (0.2%). The prevalence of MD was higher among older myopic subjects and among participants with more severe myopia and longer axial length (P <.001). Conclusions These data provide the first population-based estimates of MD in Chinese Americans and indicate that a high proportion of Chinese Americans might be at risk for MD and associated visual complications. Prevalence of MD in this cohort of Chinese Americans was higher than that observed in other East Asian populations and in people of other ethnicities.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Reducing the impact of the impending myopia epidemic in New Zealand

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Myopia is an eye condition that is increasing around the world, reaching epidemic levels in many countries. It is associated with a higher risk of other ocular diseases including myopic maculopathy and retinal detachment. Historically in New Zealand myopia has existed at a low level, however the environmental changes that have increased myopia internationally will affect New Zealanders too. Higher levels of myopia will have a profound social, economic and health burden on our country. Fortunately, proven interventions to limit the onset and degree of myopia already exist. To limit the level of myopia in New Zealand we propose the creation of a multidisciplinary myopia action group (NZMAG). The NZMAG will serve to support local research, raise awareness of the condition and its associated pathologies, facilitate access to myopia control treatments, improve identification of at-risk children via screening programs, and serve as the guiding body for myopia-related information. With prompt action now, the myopia epidemic seen in other countries can be reduced in New Zealand.Copyright © NZMA.

N2  - Although ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) analysis in the patients with high myopia is useful, there have been few reports to analyze of the reliability for long-term measured GC-IPL thickness. We aimed to analyze the long-term reproducibility of thickness measurements of the GC-IPL using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in patients with high myopia and identify factors that affect such reproducibility. 99 eyes from 99 patients with high myopia without any other ophthalmc disorder such as glaucoma or retinal diseases were included. Two serial SD-OCT (Cirrus-HD) macular scans taken at 1 year intervals were analyzed. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), and test-retest standard deviation (TRTSD) of GC-IPL thickness measurements were assessed. The ICC, CV, and TRTSD of the mean GC-IPL thicknesses were 0.883, 5.9%, and 2.74, respectively. The ICCs of the six-sector GC-IPL thicknesses ranged from 0.740 to 0.904. The CVs of the minimal and all sectoral GC-IPL thicknesses were <10%. Measurement variances for the mean GC-IPL thicknesses showed significant relationshiups with chorioretinal atrophy and posterior staphyloma. There is high long-term reproducibility in GC-IPL thickness measurements using SD-OCT in high-myopia patients. The factors affecting this reproducibility include chorioretinal atrophy and posterior staphyloma.

N2  - SIGNIFICANCE: Some studies reported that optic disc tilt and rotation might be risk factors for the susceptibility of high myopic eyes to develop glaucoma. However, data regarding optic disc manifestations in high myopia participants are few. It is crucial to characterize the features of optic disc manifestations among high myopes. PURPOSE: To describe optic disc characteristics of Chinese highly myopic eyes and to investigate associated factors. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional, observational study included 890 Chinese with bilateral high myopia (defined as <=-6.00 diopters spherical power) in 2012. All subjects underwent cycloplegic autorefraction, ocular biometry, and fundus photography. The optic disc tilt ratio, degree of rotation, and beta-zone peripapillary atrophy area were measured from the 45degreeoptic disc-centered fundus photographs. Optic disc tilt was defined as optic disc tilt ratio, the ratio of maximum to minimum diameter of optic disc, exceeding 1.3. The definition of optic disc rotation was using optic disc rotation degree, the angle from long diameter and the vertical meridian, of >15degree. RESULT(S): Among 890 participants, 2 were excluded by ungradable optic disc-centered fundus photographs. In the 888 studied right eyes, the mean spherical power was -9.36 +/- 3.46 diopters with a mean axial length of 27.51 +/- 1.63 mm. The proportion of optic disc tilting, rotation, and beta-zone peripapillary atrophy were 81.2%, 48.3%, and 92.8%, respectively. The mean ratio of optic disc tilting and rotation degree was 1.78 +/- 0.53 and 21.08 +/- 19.91degree; the mean area of beta-zone peripapillary atrophy/optic disc head was 1.11 +/- 1.22. A multiple linear regression showed that older age (P < .001), female (P = .02), and more myopic spherical equivalent (P = .005) were related to the greater optic disc tilting ratio. CONCLUSION(S): Beta-zone peripapillary atrophy, optic disc tilting, and rotation are very common in highly myopic eyes in Chinese population. Older age, female, and more myopic spherical equivalent are risk factors of higher degree of optic disc tilting.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the cumulative five-year incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy in a rural Chinese adult population. METHOD(S): The Handan Eye Study was a population-based longitudinal study. In 2006, 6830 subjects aged 30+ years participated in this study (baseline). Five years later, 5394 subjects (follow-up rate: 85.3%) took part in the follow-up study. Participants had a detailed eye examination, including visual acuity, standardized refraction and fundus photography according to a similar protocol at both baseline and follow-up. Myopic maculopathy was defined as any of the following signs: diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, lacquer cracks and myopic choroidal neovascularization at the posterior pole. Parapapillary atrophy was assessed separately. RESULT(S): Of 5394 participants, 5078 (10 021 eyes) had gradable fundus photographs. Over the five years, four participants (five eyes) developed new myopic maculopathy, with an eye-specific incidence of 0.05% (95% CI, 0.02-0.10%). Among the 51 eyes with myopic maculopathy at baseline, the progression occurred in 18 eyes (35.3%), with new signs of patchy chorioretinal atrophy in 11 eyes (21.6%), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy in seven eyes (13.7%), lacquer cracks in three eyes (6.9%), macular atrophy in three eyes (6.9%) and myopic choroidal neovascularization in two eyes (3.9%). By multivariable analysis, female gender (OR, 9.14; p = 0.004) and higher educational level (OR, 8.24; p = 0.004) were associated with a higher risk of progression of myopic maculopathy, whereas lower myopia at baseline (OR, 0.79; p < 0.0001) and hypertension (OR, 0.21; p = 0.017) were associated with a reduced risk. CONCLUSION(S): The five-year incidence of myopic maculopathy was 0.05% in rural Chinese adults aged 30+ years. The progression rate in participants with myopic maculopathy was 35.3%, indicating the importance of regular follow-up for these patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics © 2018 The College of Optometrists.

N2  - A structurally and functionally intact choroid tissue is vitally important for the retina function. Although central retinal artery is responsible to supply the inner retina, choroidal vein network is responsible for the remaining one-third of the external part. Abnormal choroidal blood flow leads to photoreceptor dysfunction and photoreceptor death in the retina, and the choroid has vital roles in the pathophysiology of many diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. Biomarkers of choroidal diseases can be identified in various imaging modalities that visualize the choroid. Indocyanine green angiography enables the visualization of choroid veins under the retinal pigment epithelium and choroidal blood flow. New insights into a precise structural and functional analysis of the choroid have been possible, thanks to recent progress in retinal imaging based on enhanced depth imaging (EDI) and swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) technologies. Long-wavelength SS-OCT enables the choroid and the choroid-sclera interface to be imaged at greater depth and to quantify choroidal thickness profiles throughout a volume scan, thus exposing the morphology of intermediate and large choroidal vessels. Finally, OCT angiography allows a dye-free evaluation of the blood flow in the choriocapillaris and in the choroid. We hereby review different imaging findings of choroidal diseases that can be used as biomarkers of activity and response to the treatment.

N2  - Purpose: To examine the progression pattern of myopic maculopathy. Design(s): Retrospective, observational case series. Participant(s): Highly myopic patients who had been followed up for 10 years or more. Method(s): Using fundus photographs, myopic features were differentiated according to Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) Study Group recommendations. Main Outcome Measure(s): Progression pattern of maculopathy. Result(s): The study included 810 eyes of 432 patients (mean age, 42.3+/-16.8 years; mean axial length, 28.8+/-1.9 mm; mean follow-up, 18.7+/-7.1 years). The progression rate of myopic maculopathy was 47.0 per 1000 eye-years. Within the pathologic myopia (PM) group (n = 521 eyes), progression of myopic maculopathy was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.21; P = 0.001), older age (OR, 1.03; P = 0.002), longer axial length (OR, 1.20; P = 0.007), greater axial elongation (OR, 1.45; P = 0.005), and development of parapapillary atrophy (PPA; OR, 3.14; P < 0.001). Diffuse atrophy, found in 217 eyes without choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or lacquer cracks (LCs) at baseline, progressed in 111 (51%) eyes, leading to macular diffuse atrophy (n = 64; 64/111 or 58%), patchy atrophy (n = 59; 53%), myopic CNV (n = 18; 16%), LCs (n = 9; 5%), and patchy-related macular atrophy (n = 3; 3%). Patchy atrophy, detected in 63 eyes without CNV or LCs at baseline, showed progression in 60 eyes (95%), leading to enlargement of original patchy atrophy (n = 59; 59/60 or 98%), new patchy atrophy (n = 29; 48%), CNV-related macular atrophy (n = 13; 22%), and patchy-related macular atrophy (n = 5; 8%). Of 66 eyes with LCs, 43 eyes (65%) showed progression with development of new patchy atrophy (n = 38; 38/43 or 88%) and new LCs (n = 7; 16%). Reduction in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was associated mainly (all P < 0.001) with the development of CNV or CNV-related macular atrophy and enlargement of macular atrophy. Conclusion(s): The most frequent progression patterns were an extension of peripapillary diffuse atrophy to macular diffuse atrophy in diffuse atrophy, enlargement of the original atrophic lesion in patchy atrophy, and development of patchy atrophy in LCs. Main risk factors for progression were older age, longer axial length, and development of PPA.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the progression pattern of myopic maculopathy and associated factors in a population-based study. Design(s): Population-based longitudinal study. Participant(s): The Beijing Eye Study including 4439 participants in 2001 was repeated in 2011, with 2695 individuals (66.4%) being re-examined in 2011. Method(s): The study participants underwent detailed ophthalmic and general examinations. Using fundus photographs obtained in 2001 and 2011, we assessed the progression of myopic maculopathy in highly myopic eyes with a refractive error >=-6 diopters in 2001. Myopic maculopathy was differentiated into tessellated fundus (category 1), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (category 2), patchy chorioretinal atrophy (category 3), and macular atrophy (category 4), with lacquer cracks and choroidal neovascularization as additional plus signs. Main Outcome Measure(s): Progression pattern of myopic maculopathy. Result(s): Of 110 highly myopic eyes (70 individuals) at baseline, 39 eyes (35.5%) showed progression observed in 15 of 79 eyes (19%) with tessellated fundus at baseline, in 17 of 24 eyes (71%) with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, in all 6 eyes with patchy chorioretinal atrophy, and the 1 eye with macular atrophy. Lacquer cracks detected in 2 eyes in 2001 developed into a small patchy atrophy (1 eye) or widened during the follow-up (1 eye). Five eyes demonstrated new lacquer cracks. In binary regression analysis, progression of myopic maculopathy was associated with longer axial length (P < 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 7.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.49-20.4), older age (P = 0.001; OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.42), higher prevalence of staphylomas (P = 0.03; OR, 24.3; 95% CI, 2.89-204), smaller parapapillary gamma-zone in 2011 (P = 0.01; OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91), and female gender (P = 0.04; OR, 9.78; 95% CI, 1.06-90.6). Conclusion(s): The 10-year progression rate of myopic maculopathy in this elderly Chinese population was 35.5%, increasing from 15 of 79 eyes (19%) in category 1 of myopic maculopathy at baseline to 17 of 24 eyes (71%) in category 2 and 6 of 6 eyes (100%) in category 3. Risk factors for myopic maculopathy progression were longer axial length, pre-existing staphylomata, smaller parapapillary gamma-zone, older age, and female gender.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: To assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm for detecting referable glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) based on color fundus photographs. Design(s): A deep learning system for the classification of GON was developed for automated classification of GON on color fundus photographs. Participant(s): We retrospectively included 48 116 fundus photographs for the development and validation of a deep learning algorithm. Method(s): This study recruited 21 trained ophthalmologists to classify the photographs. Referable GON was defined as vertical cup-to-disc ratio of 0.7 or more and other typical changes of GON. The reference standard was made until 3 graders achieved agreement. A separate validation dataset of 8000 fully gradable fundus photographs was used to assess the performance of this algorithm. Main Outcome Measure(s): The area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) with sensitivity and specificity was applied to evaluate the efficacy of the deep learning algorithm detecting referable GON. Result(s): In the validation dataset, this deep learning system achieved an AUC of 0.986 with sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 92.0%. The most common reasons for false-negative grading (n = 87) were GON with coexisting eye conditions (n = 44 [50.6%]), including pathologic or high myopia (n = 37 [42.6%]), diabetic retinopathy (n = 4 [4.6%]), and age-related macular degeneration (n = 3 [3.4%]). The leading reason for false-positive results (n = 480) was having other eye conditions (n = 458 [95.4%]), mainly including physiologic cupping (n = 267 [55.6%]). Misclassification as false-positive results amidst a normal-appearing fundus occurred in only 22 eyes (4.6%). Conclusion(s): A deep learning system can detect referable GON with high sensitivity and specificity. Coexistence of high or pathologic myopia is the most common cause resulting in false-negative results. Physiologic cupping and pathologic myopia were the most common reasons for false-positive results.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: To explore novel prognostic factors associated with visual function and number of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments in eyes with active myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) using OCT angiography (OCTA). Design(s): Prospective case series. Participant(s): Twenty-eight treatment-naive eyes with active mCNV from 27 consecutive patients (mean age, 64.4 +/- 11.1 years). Method(s): All eyes received through injection a single loading dose of intravitreal aflibercept (IVA), followed by additional IVA on a pro re nata (PRN) basis during the subsequent 12 months. At baseline, OCTA images of a 3 x 3-mm macular cube were acquired using an OCTA scanner. On binarized and skeletonized OCTA images of the outer retinal layer, OCTA-derived baseline parameters of mCNV-including lesion size, vessel density, vessel length density (VLD), vessel diameter index, and fractal dimension (FD)-were measured and evaluated for correlation with 12-month best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and number of additional injections. Main Outcome Measure(s): The primary and secondary outcomes were BCVA 12 months after initial treatment and number of additional injections, respectively. Result(s): There was no significant difference between baseline and 12-month BCVA (0.37 +/- 0.30 and 0.30 +/- 0.35 logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution, respectively; P = 0.23). The number of additional injections was 0.93 +/- 1.02 (mean +/- standard deviation). Baseline VLD, FD, and BCVA were correlated with 12-month BCVA (P = 0.02, r = 0.46; P = 0.02, r = 0.46; and P = 0.02, r = 0.45, respectively), and VLD also was correlated with the number of additional injections (P = 0.03, r = 0.42). Conclusion(s): Exuberant mCNV, which is characterized by high VLD and FD derived using OCTA, is a predictor of poor visual outcomes after a single IVA injection followed by a PRN regimen. Only baseline VLD was correlated with the number of additional IVA injections, which indicates that this parameter could help to determine the optimal anti-VEGF treatment regimen for individual eyes with mCNV.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: There is a limited understanding of ocular risk factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Our aim therefore was to determine the relationship of 2 retinal signs related to axial myopia (peripapillary atrophy [PPA] and fundus tessellation) with DR. Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Method(s): Of 3353 subjects (72.8% response rate) who participated in the population-based Singapore Chinese Eye Study, 592 participants had diabetes. Of these, 1010 eyes from 530 participants were included in our analyses after excluding participants without gradable retinal photographs or missing key variables. DR, PPA-beta (beta), and fundus tessellation were graded from retinal photographs. The associations between PPA-beta or fundus tessellation with DR were analyzed using logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations. Main Outcome Measure(s): Diabetic retinopathy. Result(s): Among the 530 participants, the mean (standard deviation) age was 62.8 (9.2) years, and 288 (54.3%) were male. PPA-beta and fundus tessellation were both associated with longer axial length (AL). In multivariable analyses adjusting for potential confounders including AL, eyes with PPA-beta or fundus tessellation were less likely to have any DR, with odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.58 (0.41-0.83) and 0.46 (0.25-0.87), respectively. These associations with DR were consistent in models adjusting for refractive status, and in a subanalysis that excluded eyes with high AL (>24.5 mm). Conclusion(s): Eyes with PPA-beta or fundus tessellation were less likely to have DR, independent of diabetes risk factors, AL, or refractive status. The presence of these 2 ophthalmic features may indicate lower risk of DR.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to etiologies other than age-related macular degeneration and pathologic myopia. Method(s): Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and CENTRAL. Result(s): The search identified 5 RCTs; no relevant observational studies were identified. The studies differed in terms of underlying cause of CNV, patient numbers (n = 9-178), follow-up time (2-36 months) and quality assessment. In the largest RCT (n = 178 across a range of rare CNV etiologies), intravitreal ranibizumab showed superior efficacy versus sham from baseline to month 2 [mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA): + 9.5 vs. - 0.4 letters; p < 0.001]; the gain was maintained up to month 12. In the treatment of CNV secondary to presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), both intravitreal ranibizumab and photodynamic therapy (PDT) showed significant improvement from baseline BCVA over the 12-month period (n = 9); however, all patients in the PDT group required rescue ranibizumab therapy. Unlicensed intravitreal bevacizumab was associated with a statistically significant improvement in BCVA compared to PDT at 12 months (p < 0.001) in patients with CNV secondary to multifocal choroiditis (n = 27). The use of steroids before PDT showed better BCVA outcomes than PDT alone (p < 0.05) in patients with idiopathic CNV (n = 20). Argon green laser therapy showed limited efficacy in patients with CNV secondary to OHS (n = 134). Conclusion(s): There is evidence from a relatively large, good-quality study to support the use of intravitreal ranibizumab for the treatment of CNV secondary to rare diseases. However, the limited number of RCTs for this indication and differences in study characteristics between RCTs mean that there is uncertainty regarding comparative clinical effectiveness of interventions. RCTs with an active comparator are required to fully establish the comparative effectiveness of treatments for CNV secondary to rare diseases.

N2  - PURPOSE. To assess the prevalence of refractive errors and associated factors in university students in urban areas of Anyang, Central China. METHODS. This is a cross-sectional university-based study of 16-to 26-year-old students in China. Subjects from two universities were invited to undergo a comprehensive eye examination. Cycloplegic refraction was acquired by autorefractor with two drops of 1% cyclopentolate. The prevalence of myopia, high myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and anisometropia was calculated. Only data from right eyes were included in analysis. RESULTS. A total of 7732 eligible subjects were included, with an average age of 20.2 6 1.4 years. Overall, the mean spherical equivalent (SE) was 2.92 6 2.48 diopters (D). The prevalence of myopia (SE <= 0.50 D), emmetropia, and hyperopia (SE ++ 0.50 D) was 83.2%, 9.5%, and 7.3%, respectively. Female sex (OR 1/4 1.542; P < 0.001) and science and engineering students (OR 1/4 1.219; P 1/4 0.004) were more likely to be myopic. The prevalence of high myopia, defined using SE <= 5.0 D, <= 6.0 D, and <= 10.0 D, respectively, occurred in 20.2%, 11.1 %, and 0.5%. High myopia (SE <= 6.0 D) was statistically associated with female sex (OR 1/4 1.202; P 1/4 0.029) and younger age (OR 1/4 0.896; P 1/4 0.001). The prevalence of astigmatism (cylinder of <= 0.75 D) was 28.8%. Astigmatism was associated with male sex (OR 1/4 0.824; P 1/4 0.001) and younger age (OR 1/4 0.925; P 1/4 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. A prevalence of 83.2% for myopia and 11.1% for high myopia (SE <= 6.0 D) was found in central Chinese university students. In the future, this generation of university students may encounter long-term, vision-threatening effects, especially pathologic myopia.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - PURPOSE. To determine the prevalence, risk factors, and impact of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) on visual impairment and functioning among adults in Singapore. METHODS. A comprehensive eye examination, including subjective refraction, axial length, and visual acuity (VA) measurements, was performed in adults aged ++40 years in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study. From fundus photographs, MMD was graded using the International META-PM classification. Vision-specific functioning (VSF) was assessed with a validated visual-functioning questionnaire (VF-11) using Rasch analysis. RESULTS. A total of 8716 phakic subjects were included in this analysis. The mean age (+/- SD) was 57.2 +/- 9.5 years (33.5% Malays, 33.2% Indians, and 33.3% Chinese). The prevalence of myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] <= -0.5 diopters [D]) and high myopia (SE <= -5.0 D) was 35.7% and 6.0%, respectively. The age-standardized prevalence of MMD was 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4-4.3%). The prevalence of MMD was 7.7% among low to moderate myopes, and 28.7% among high myopes. The prevalence of MMD increased nonlinearly with SE and age. MMD was associated with older age, more myopic SE, and lower education. Subjects with Meta-PM categories 3 or 4 in the better-seeing eye had worse best-corrected VA (beta, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.16-0.23) and poorer VSF (beta, -9.7; 95%CI, -17.6 to -1.8) than those without MMD after multivariate adjustments. CONCLUSIONS. Approximately 1 in 26 phakic adults in Singapore has MMD. Older age and myopic SE are major risk factors of MMD. Severe MMD has a substantial impact on visual impairment and functioning.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - Background: Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a common cause of central visual loss in patients with high myopia, and the most common form of CNV in younger individuals. Pharmacologic therapy is the current mainstay of treatment of these patients. Method(s): Review of pharmacological treatment options for myopic CNV, which primarily involves intravitreal administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. Result(s): At this time, anti-VEGF therapy agents are the first-line therapy in these patients. Comparative trials have not identified any major differences in treatment outcomes between aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab. Only ranibizumab is approved for this indication in the US. Best visual outcomes are associated with younger age, smaller lesion size, and absence of chorioretinal atrophy. Conclusion(s): Anti-VEGF therapy is generally very effective in the treatment of myopic CNV.Copyright © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  - Purpose We used systematic review and meta-analysis to identify and assimilate evidence quantifying blindness and visual impairment (VI) associated with myopic macular degeneration (MMD), then derived models to predict global patterns. The models were used to estimate the global prevalence of blindness and VI associated with MMD from 2000 to 2050. Methods The systematic review identified 17 papers with prevalence data for MMD VI fitting our inclusion criteria. Data from six papers with age-specific data were scaled to relative age-dependent risk and meta-analysed at VI and blindness levels. We analysed variance in all MMD VI and blindness data as a proportion of high myopia against variables from the place and year of data collection, with a model based on health expenditure providing the best correlation. We used this model to estimate the prevalence and number of people with MMD VI in each country in each decade. Results We included data from 17 studies comprising 137 514 participants. We estimated 10.0 million people had VI from MMD in 2015 (prevalence 0.13%, 95% CI 5.5 to 23.7 million, 0.07% to 0.34%), 3.3 million of whom were blind (0.04%, 1.8 to 7.8 million, 0.03% to 0.10%). We estimate that by 2050, without changing current interventions, VI from MMD will grow to 55.7 million people (0.57%, 29.0 to 119.7 million, 0.33% to 1.11%), 18.5 million of whom will be blind (0.19%, 9.6 to 39.7 million, 0.11% to 0.37%). Conclusion The burden of MMD blindness and VI will rise significantly without efforts to reduce the development and progression of myopia and improve the management of MMD.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

N2  - Purpose: The increasing prevalence of high myopia and its associated pathologies has raised challenges to ophthalmic services. This project aims to explore the onset and progression of myopic pathologies in highly myopic eyes through a prospective research cohort established in South China. Method(s): Patients with high myopia (sphere <= -6.00 D) visiting the optometric clinic of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) were invited to participate in the baseline examinations and follow-up visit over a 10-year period. People having secondary myopia, history of any refractive surgery, significant ocular media opacity, or other severe health problems were excluded. The measurements included visual acuity, ocular biometry, visual function, cycloplegic refraction, fundus imaging, ocular shape by MRI, blood tests and questionnaires. Result(s): A total of 890 participants completed the baseline examinations, with a mean age at baseline of 22.7 +/- 12.4 years. The mean spherical equivalent at baseline was 10.13 +/- 3.65 D, and the mean axial length (AL) was 27.52 +/- 1.63 mm. The older subjects tended to have more severe myopia and longer ALs. Conclusion(s): The study will provide new knowledge on the relationship between high myopia and pathological changes such as myopic macular degeneration and staphyloma.Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - PURPOSE: Posterior staphyloma is an ocular complication associated with high myopia and reflects degenerative changes on the sclera. Its morphology is associated with chorioretinal atrophy and myopic maculopathy. The purpose of this study was to validate the efficacy of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in providing a simple estimation of the staphyloma pattern. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational case-series study of high myopic patients with posterior staphylomas. Patients were examined using the star scan pattern OCT in different radial planes. Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance tomography was also performed to visualize the anatomical characteristics of the posterior pole. 3D-segmentation and curvature analysis were also performed. RESULT(S): Eight patients were totally enrolled in this pilot study. Our study pool consisted of 2 wide macular staphylomas, 2 narrow macular staphylomas, and 4 barrel-shaped staphylomas. Our preliminary results revealed that patients displayed mirror-image distortion in the steeper staphyloma axis. In the barrel-shaped subtype, no image distortion was displayed in any plane. CONCLUSION(S): We estimated the axis of the smaller base curvature by noting the distortion pattern in the different radial axis. The recognition of pathologic axial myopia is important since there is a risk of permanent vision loss from vision to threatening sequelae.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognostic value of the development of a hyperre-flective envelopment of the neovascular tissue in myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) after the first intravitreal ranibizumab injection and to establish a tomographic classification of mCNV depending on this healing process. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five eyes of 25 patients with mCNV were retrospectively studied. Patients were classified into type A (presence of a hyperreflective coating of the neovascular tissue 1 month after first intravitreal ranibizumab) and type B (absence of or partial coating). Visual acuity (VA) and number of injections were recorded. Differences between both types were assessed at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. RESULT(S): Fifteen patients (60%) were classified as type A and 10 as type B (40%). Type A showed better VA than type B. VA improvement was only significant for type A. No differences in the number of injections were observed; however, a trend to a larger amount in type B was observed. CONCLUSION(S): The proposed classification may have prognostic value, with type A mCNV showing better visual outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2018 Slack Incorporated. All rights reserved.

Methods A total of 736 Chinese Han patients (1384 eyes) with high myopia (refractive error<=6.0 diopters or axial length >=26.5 mm) are reviewed based on information entered into a high-myopia database at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and parafoveal choroidal thickness (PFCT) are measured. The prevalence of DSM in patients with myopic maculopathy is categorised from C0 to C4. Clinical features, including macular complications, SFCT and PFCT, are compared between myopic eyes with and without DSM. Results Among the 1384 eyes, 149 (10.77%) show DSM. In highly myopic eyes without macular complications, the best corrected visual acuity is significantly worse in patients with DSM (p=0.002), and the ratio between subfoveal and parafoveal choroidal thickness (S/PCT) is significantly elevated in patients with DSM (p=0.021). The proportion of foveal schisis (17.24% vs 62.86%) is much lower in eyes with DSM compared with those without DSM. However, the proportions of extrafoveal schisis (39.66% vs 5.37%), foveal serous retinal detachment (SRD) (5.17% vs 0) and epiretinal membrane (ERM) (24.14% vs 10.74%) are much higher in eyes with DSM. The proportion of DSM was lower in C0 and C1, but higher proportion of DSM was found in C3 and C4. Conclusions DSM is found in 10.77% of highly myopic eyes among Chinese Han. DSM might be a protective mechanism for foveal schisis and a risk factor for extrafoveal schisis, SRD and ERM.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

N2  - Importance: Retinal structures may serve as a biomarker for dementia, but longitudinal studies examining this link are lacking. Objective(s): To investigate the association of inner retinal layer thickness with prevalent and incident dementia in a general population of Dutch adults. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): From September 2007 to June 2012, participants from the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study who were 45 years and older and had gradable retinal optical coherence tomography images and at baseline were free from stroke, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinopathy, myopia, hyperopia, and optic disc pathology were included. They were followed up until January 1, 2015, for the onset of dementia. Exposures: Inner retinal layer thicknesses (ie, retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL]) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thicknesses measured on optical coherence tomography images. Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds ratios and hazard ratios for incident dementia per SD decrease in retinal layer thickness adjusted for age, sex, education, and cardiovascular risk factors. Result(s): Of 5065 individuals eligible for optical coherence tomography scanning, 3289 (64.9%) (mean [SD] age 68.9 [9.9] years, 1879 [57%] women) were included in the analysis. Of these 3289 individuals, 41 (1.2%) already had dementia. Thinner GC-IPL was associated with prevalent dementia (odds ratio per SD decrease in GC-IPL, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.99-1.90]). No association was found of RNFL with prevalent dementia. During 14674 person-years of follow-up (mean [SD], 4.5 [1.6] years), 86 individuals (2.6%) developed dementia of whom 68 (2.1%) had Alzheimer disease. Thinner RNFL at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing dementia (hazard ratio per SD decrease in RNFL, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.19-1.75]), which was similar for Alzheimer disease (hazard ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.15-1.78]). No association was found between GC-IPL thickness and incident dementia (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.90-1.43]). Conclusions and Relevance: Thinner RNFL is associated with an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, suggesting that retinal neurodegeneration may serve as a preclinical biomarker for dementia..Copyright © 2018 American Medical Association.

N2  - PURPOSE. To quantitatively assess the posterior pole shape change in highly myopic eyes and to investigate the factors determining the speed of shape change. METHODS. Local curvature of the Bruch's membrane on the optical coherence tomography image was measured at intervals of 1 mum, and the mean curvature and curvature variance were calculated for 1094 eyes with an axial length of >=26 mm. Speed of shape change was calculated using two points of mean curvature and curvature variance, and compared according to age, sex, axial length, and baseline eye shape. RESULTS. The posterior pole shape of females changed significantly greater than males (P < 0.01). Protruding change through the mean curvature was the greatest in the eyes with an axial length of >=28 mm and <29 mm, while undulating change through the curvature variance became greater with axial length elongation in the eyes with an axial length of <29 mm and showed similar change in the eyes with an axial length of >=29 mm. The eyes with a flatter shape at baseline tended to show a slow shape change, whereas those with moderate shape deformation at baseline showed faster shape change. CONCLUSIONS. Quantitative evaluation of posterior pole eye shape clearly demonstrated significant time-dependent protruding and undulating changes in highly myopic eyes. Sex, axial length, and baseline posterior pole eye shape significantly affected speed of the posterior pole shape change. Our findings will facilitate risk assessment of staphyloma-associated complications in highly myopic eyes through measurement of speed of the posterior pole shape change.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to document the distribution of the severity of myopic maculopathy in a cohort of highly myopic patients and to explore the associated risk factors. METHODS. A total of 890 Chinese highly myopes aged between 7 and 70 years (median age 19 years) and with spherical refraction 6.00 diopter (D) or worse in both eyes were investigated. All participants underwent detailed ophthalmic examination. Myopic maculopathy was graded into 5 categories according to the International Photographic Classification and Grading System using color fundus photographs: category 0, no myopic retinal lesions, category 1, tessellated fundus only; category 2, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy; category 3, patchy chorioretinal atrophy; category 4, macular atrophy. Category 2 or greater were further classified as clinically significant myopic maculopathy (CSMM). RESULTS. Data from 884 of 890 right eyes were available for analysis. The proportions of category 1, category 2, category 3, and category 4 were 20.0% (177 eyes), 20.2% (178 eyes), 2.6% (23 eyes), and 0.2% (2 eyes), respectively. The proportion of CSMM increased with more myopic refraction (odds ratio 1.57; 95% confidence interval: 1.46-1.68), longer axial length (odds ratio 2.97; 95% confidence interval: 2.50-3.53), and older age (40-70 years compared to 12-18 years, odds ratio 6.77; 95% confidence interval: 3.61-12.70). However, there was a higher proportion of CSMM in children aged 7 to 11 years than those aged 12 to 18 years (20.9% vs. 11.0%, P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS. Older age, more myopic refraction, and longer axial length were associated with more severe myopic maculopathy. Although CSMM was uncommon among younger participants, children with early-onset high myopia have a disproportionately increased risk.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the natural disease progression of high myopia in Caucasians considered at risk for the development of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Method(s): Subjects were recruited in 25 clinical sites between June 2014 and June 2016. Main inclusion criteria included axial length of >=26 mm, best-corrected visual acuity >=0.05 decimal equivalent and presence of at least one out of five predefined morphological disease risk criteria. These were (1) subfoveal choroidal thinning < 50 mum, (2) enhanced choroidal curvature length > 6,300 mum, (3) lacquer cracks, (4) patchy atrophy > 5 mm2 and (5) preexisting mCNV in the fellow eye (German Clinical Trial Register DRKS00007761). Result(s): A total of 150 participants (66% females) with a mean age of 57.2 (+/-12.7) years (range 21.9-86.2 years) were included. The disease criteria most frequently encountered were choroidal thinning (33.3%) and lacquer cracks (32.7%). Enhanced choroidal curvature length was detected in only 8 subjects and always occurred in combination with other disease criteria. Presence of patchy atrophy was found to be more common in older subjects (p = 0.0012) and also associated with a more severe disease manifestation. Conclusion(s): The baseline data of this study indicate that enhanced choroidal curvature might be less common in Caucasians than in Asian populations. Further, disease severity in patients with high myopia is relatively high in the presence of patchy atrophy.© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: High myopia and pathologic myopia are common causes of visual morbidity. Myopic pathology can affect all regions of the retina, though there is currently no classification system to distinguish anterior (peripheral) and posterior (macular) pathology. We hypothesize that these classifications are characterized by distinct demographic and refractive features, highlighting the disparity in types of pathologic myopia. Method(s): Institutional retrospective cohort study. The Stanford University Medical Center Clinical Data Warehouse was used to identify patients with high myopia by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Predetermined ICD diagnoses were then used to classify patients with high myopia into isolated high myopia (IHM), anterior pathologic myopia (APM), posterior pathologic myopia (PPM), and combined pathologic myopia (CPM). A cohort of this population was then manually reviewed to gather refractive data and confirm accuracy of ICD coding. Result(s): Patients (3274) were identified with high myopia. Overall, 22.1% individuals met criteria for APM, 10.7% for PPM, 17.0% for CPM, and 50.2% for IHM. We identified a significantly higher frequency of females with PPM compared to APM (62.3 vs. 48.3%; OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.25), Asian patients with PPM as compared to APM (42.9 vs. 33.3%; OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.95), and younger patients with APM compared to PPM (median 45.3 vs. 63.4 years). The refractive error was significantly more myopic in the CPM (median - 9.8D; interquartile range, IQR 6.7) and PPM (median - 10.5D; IQR 9.8) subgroups as compared to the APM (median - 8.1D; IQR 3.5), and IHM (median - 8.2D; IQR 4.1) subgroups (p = 0.003). Conclusion(s): High myopia may be divided into four distinct subgroups based on presence and location of pathology, which is associated with differences in age, gender, race, and refractive error.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Purpose: To report the incidence and characteristics of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injections (IVI) of antivascular endothelial growth factor agents and triamcinolone acetonide. Method(s): Patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed from January 2009 to June 2016, and the incidence, risk factors, clinical and microbiological characteristics of post-IVI endophthalmitis were evaluated. Result(s): The total number of intravitreal injections given, which included ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and triamcinolone acetonide, was 20,566, of which 27 cases developed endophthalmitis, giving an overall incidence of 0.131%. Significant reduction (p < 0.003) in incidence of endophthalmitis was observed in patients who received prefilled compounded bevacizumab injections (0.050%) compared to multiple bevacizumab injections from a single vial (0.235%). In the triamcinolone acetonide group, the incidence was 0.26%. Staphylococcus species were isolated from 18 cases (67%), and all strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Conclusion(s): Adherence to strict aseptic protocols and use of prefilled compounded bevacizumab injections reduces the rate of post-IVI endophthalmitis.Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Purpose To investigate the association between oral fluoroquinolones (FQ) and the risk of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) using a nationwide population-based study in Korea, designed to control for time-related bias. Methods As a nested case-control study within a cohort, the KNHIS-NSC 2002-2013 (Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort) data used for the investigation. The subjects who visited an ophthalmologist were included in a cohort. Subjects with infectious ocular diseases, severe ocular trauma, and congenital diseases were excluded. Within the cohort, subjects who underwent surgery for RRD were defined as cases, and controls were matched by age group, sex, and cohort entry date using an incidence density sampling method. After investigating the exposure to oral FQ, the odds ratio was calculated by the FQ exposure rate of both groups and adjusted by the confounding factors of demography, health service utilization, and comorbidities. Results A total of 1,151 subjects in the case group and 11,470 subjects in the control group were included. There were intergroup differences in household income, numbers of ophthalmologic visits and drug prescriptions, events of intraocular surgeries, and prevalence of diabetes and degenerative myopia (all P's<0.05). The crude odds ratio of the total group was 1.06 (P = 0.53, 95% CI 0.88-1.28), and the odds ratio adjusted for all pre-defined confounders was 1.00 (P = 0.99, 95% CI 0.81-1.24). The crude and adjusted odds ratios were not showed statistical significance (all P's>0.05). Conclusions By the nested case-control design, this study showed that oral administration of FQ was not associated with the increased risk of development of RRD.Copyright © 2018 Choi et al.

N2  - Aims: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents effectively treat age-related macular degeneration and myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a fibrinolytic compound, is used as an adjuvant to displace submacular hemorrhage and to treat type 2 CNV. The purpose of this study was to investigate in in vitro and in vivo experiments the antiangiogenic impact of tPA itself. Method(s): The impact of tPA on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was assessed by an XTT assay [2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide]. A basic fibroblast growth factor-impregnated gelatin hydrogel sheet was implanted into the rabbit cornea to induce corneal neovascularization. Immediately postoperatively, tPA or buffered saline solution (control) was injected intravitreally. Result(s): The growth and viability of the HUVECs were unaffected by tPA at clinical concentrations. In the control group, the mean lengths of the new vessels were 1.0 +/- 0.41, 1.6 +/- 0.75, and 3.6 +/- 2.1 mm at weeks 1, 2, and 4, respectively. In contrast, tPA significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the corneal neovascularization. Conclusion(s): Although tPA has no direct impact on the vascular endothelial cells in vitro, the fibrinolytic effects of tPA might markedly suppress neovascularization in vivo.© 2018 S.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the type and prevalence of peripheral retinal changes and its relationship with axial length (AL) in a population of young Asian adult males. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study of male subjects aged between 19 and 25 years old. High myopes [spherical equivalent refraction, (SER) < -6.00 D] were recruited and underwent further ocular investigations including dilated retinal photography and binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy by two trained ophthalmologists. The frequency of peripheral retinal changes within high myopes was correlated with axial length and also compared with a group of emmetropes (SER between -0.50 D and +1.00 D). Result(s): A total of 593 high myopes and 156 emmetropes were recruited. White without pressure (WWOP; n = 458, 46.5%) and lattice degeneration (LD; n = 109, 14.6%) were the commonest findings, and their prevalence was significantly higher among high myopes (LD, 16.9% versus 5.8%; WWOP, 57.2% versus 5.8%; both p < 0.001). Among high myopes, temporal LD was more common (71%) and 35% had more than one area in the same eye. Increasing AL was associated with LD (odds ratio 1.28, p = 0.01) and retinal holes (odd's ratio 1.44, p = 0.02) on multivariate analysis. Conclusion(s): White without pressure (WWOP) and LD were the commonest peripheral retinal changes. One-third of high myopes with LD had more than one area in the same eye. Increasing AL was associated with LD and retinal holes. Studies in older adults should be conducted to develop clinical guidelines for the management of high myopes.Copyright © 2018 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) changes following intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy and to identify SFCT and clinical parameters associated with functional anatomical prognoses in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Method(s): Forty-five pathologic myopia patients with unilateral mCNV (45 eyes) were enrolled in the study. All patients were treated with a single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab or ranibizumab by Pro Re Nata regimen. All subjects were evaluated by Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at baseline, one month, three months, and final visit after treatment. Result(s): Anti-VEGF therapeutics revealed significantly improved best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), significantly decreased central foveal thickness (CFT), and greatest linear dimension (GLD) (all P < 0.05). SFCT revealed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) after anti-VEGF treatment. In multivariate regression analysis, baseline BCVA and recurrence associated significantly with final BCVA (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Baseline GLD and recurrence were associated significantly with final GLD (P = 0.001, respectively). In generalized linear model (GLM) analyses, number of injections was associated with recurrence (P = 0.001). However, SFCT was not associated with final BCVA, GLD, and number of injections. Conclusion(s): Anti-VEGF regimen was proven to be effective on mCNV, probably arousing significant changes in choroidal thickness. However, SFCT was not associated with functional and anatomical prognoses.Copyright © 2018, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

T1  - DIRECTIONAL CHANGES in TISSUE REFLECTIVITY MAY INFLUENCE FLOW DETECTION on OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY

N2  - Purpose: To determine if directional or anatomical changes in tissue reflectivity of Henle fiber layer (HFL) may influence flow detection on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Method(s): Cross-sectional analysis of consecutive cases undergoing OCT-A. Directional changes in visualization of HFL were either produced manually by moving the beam entrance within the pupil or observed occurring naturally because of tilting of the OCT line-scan within a myopic staphyloma. Areas of enhanced HFL visualization were identified on cross-sectional and en face structural OCT scans. Visualization of OCT-A flow within the superficial and the deep capillary plexuses were compared in areas with and without enhanced HFL reflectivity. Result(s): Fifteen eyes from 9 patients were included, with a mean age of 49.6 +/- 17.9 years. On OCT-A, retinal areas with enhanced HFL reflectivity produced manually or by scan tilting within myopic staphylomas showed no changes in the superficial capillary plexus flow. However, deep capillary plexus flow was altered by variable projection of the superficial flow onto the deeper retinal layers. Conclusion(s): Directional changes in HFL reflectivity can alter the detection of deep capillary plexus flow imaged with OCT-A by influencing the projection of superficial flow onto the deeper retinal layers. We recommend that clinicians minimize scan tilting during scan acquisition and be aware of this phenomenon in eyes with posterior staphyloma.Copyright © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  - Background/Aims The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of several optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings to estimate choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) activity in pathological myopia using fluorescein angiography (FA) as a reference. Methods This was a single-centre, retrospective study. The medical records of patients with active myopic CNV who received intravitreal bevacizumab treatment were reviewed. Parameters to monitor CNV activity were morphological features of CNV on OCT, such as CNV height, central foveal thickness, intraretinal cysts, subretinal fluid, fuzziness of the CNV border, CNV network area on FA, and haemorrhage or exudation on fundus photo. Results There were 46 patients with active CNV enrolled in this study. After intravitreal bevacizumab treatment, all the previously mentioned parameters of CNV were significantly improved. Using logistic regression analyses with backward elimination, the fuzzy border seen on OCT showed the most significant correlation with improvement of leakage on FA, when compared with other variables such as intraretinal cysts, subretinal fluid or central foveal thickness (R 2 =0.324, p=0.009). Conclusion Our study showed that the fuzziness of the hyper-reflective CNV margin showed the most significant improvement and the strongest correlation with the improvement of CNV leakage on FA after intravitreal bevacizumab injections, suggesting its important role as an OCT parameter for the assessment of myopic CNV activity.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

N2  - Purpose: Collateral vessels can sometimes develop in patients with retinal vein occlusions (RVO). However, the prognostic significance of their presence is unclear. We examined if the development of collateral vessels impacted treatment intervals between injections, visual acuity, and/or macular edema in patients with RVO. Method(s): Data was collected retrospectively through a chart review of patients seen by one retina specialist at the Retina Consultants of Hawaii from January 2000 through February 2017. 155 eyes of 155 patients were included in this study. Patients were included in this study if they had a history of macular edema secondary to RVO and at least 3 intravitreal anti-VEGF and/or steroid injections. Patients were excluded if they had diabetic macular edema, myopic degeneration, wet macular degeneration, neovascular glaucoma or a history of vitrectomy. We assessed treatment intervals, visual acuity, and central foveal thickness. Two tailed t-tests were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Of the 155 eyes, 82 eyes (52.9%) developed collateral vessels. RVO eyes that had collateral vessels had a significantly longer treatment interval (11.33 +/- 4.43 weeks) between injections as compared to RVO eyes that did not (6.74 +/- 2.98 weeks) (p < 0.0001) (Figure). Collateral vessels were not found to be associated with improvements in visual acuity (p=0.95). The mean average decrease in central foveal thickness for eyes with and without collateral vessels were 142.1 mum and 144.7 mum respectively (p=0.9133). Conclusion(s): Collateral vessel formation in patients with RVO is associated with longer treatment intervals between intravitreal injections. However, the presence of collateral vessels is not associated with improved visual acuity or decreased central foveal thickness. These findings may help guide management decisions for patients with RVO. (Figure presented).

N2  - Purpose : High myopia and pathologic myopia are common causes of visual morbidity. Myopic pathology can affect all regions of the retina, though there is currently no classification system to distinguish anterior (peripheral) and posterior (macular) pathology. We hypothesize that these classifications are characterized by distinct demographic and refractive features, highlighting the disparity in types of pathologic myopia. Methods : The Stanford University Medical Center Clinical Data Warehouse was used to identify patients with high myopia by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Predetermined ICD diagnoses were then used to classify patients with high myopia into isolated high myopia (IHM), anterior pathologic myopia (APM), posterior pathologic myopia (PPM), and combined pathologic myopia (CPM). A cohort of this population was then manually reviewed to gather refractive data and confirm the accuracy of ICD coding. Results : 3,274 patients were identified with high myopia. Overall, 22.1% individuals met criteria for APM, 10.7% for PPM, 17.0% for CPM and 50.2% for IHM. We identified a significantly higher frequency of females with PPM compared to APM (62.3% vs. 48.3%; OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.25), Asian patients with PPM as compared to APM (42.9% vs. 33.3%; OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.95), and younger patients with APM compared to PPM (median 45.3 vs 63.4 years). The refractive error was significantly more myopic in the CPM (median -9.8D; IQR -13.5, -6.8) and PPM (median -10.5D; IQR -16.6, -6.8) subgroups as compared to the APM (median -8.1D; IQR -10.4, -6.9) and IHM (median -8.2D; -10.4, -6.3) subgroups (p = 0.003). Conclusions : High myopia may be divided into four distinct subgroups based on presence and location of pathology, which is associated with differences in age, gender, race, and refractive error.

N2  - Purpose: The Beaver Dam and POLA eye studies reported that the wearing of hats and sunglasses significantly decreased the risk of some early AMD lesions. Myopia also decreases AMD risk. We hypothesize that myopia decreases retinal light dose as do hats and sunglasses which may explain its protective effect. Method(s): We created a simple one-surface schematic eye and use ray-tracing, spectacle power, vertex distance, corneal power, anterior chamber depth and axial length to calculate relative light flux through the pupil and resultant image size on the retina in a randomly selected group of 71 eyes from the Reykjavik Eye Study. Given that pupil size is known to be unaffected by refractive error, the retinal light dose (RLD) or photons/mm2 can be calculated and compared to other eyes. The results were confirmed in a computer-based optical design and ray-tracing software (Optisoft II). Result(s): RLD is inversely proportional to axial length. A 21 mm axial length eye would always be receiving 1.8X more photons/mm2 than a 27mm axial length eye. Removing a pair of commercial sunglasses would increase retinal light dose by 1.7X-5X depending on the filtering capacity of the glass. Conclusion(s): RLD is inversely proportional to axial length as is AMD risk. The parsimonious explanation for our finding is that myopia exerts its protective effect on the retina in AMD in the same way sunglasses do: by decreasing retinal light dose.

N2  - Purpose: As myopic maculopathy is a major cause of blindness in much of the world, early risk assessment and clinical detection for highly myopic patients would seem prudent. Visual field testing of the central 20 degrees can reveal valuable information about the foveal and macular function. The objective of this observational clinical study is to evaluate central visual field (VF) sensitivities in relation to the myopic maculopathy risk factors of degree of myopia, axial lengths (AL), and age. Method(s): 11 myopic subjects currently wearing soft contact lens powers (CLP)-1.00 to-12.00 diopters (D) between the ages of 18 and 59 were recruited. Subjects were excluded if they had prior diagnoses of maculopathy or systemic conditions that could affect refractive error. Subjective manifest refraction was used to verify refractive errors and calculate vertex and test distance corrected CLP for the VF assessment using the OCULUS EasyField perimeter. AL measurements were obtained with a ZEISS IOLMaster-500 optical biometer. The primary outcome measure was to compare the mean deviation (MD) on central 10-2 threshold visual fields between low myopia and high myopia using unpaired t-tests with a cut point of-6.00 D. Result(s): There were 5 subjects in the high myopic group (HMG) and 6 in the low myopic group (LMG). The spherical equivalent of the HMG was-10.47+/-1.78 D and the LMG was-3.94+/-1.86 D. Axial length of the HMG was 27.75+/-0.87 mm and the LMG was 25.66+/-0.72 mm. All subjects showed with the rule corneal toricity with the HMG having steeper K values and more corneal toricity than the LMG. Self-reported age of first spectacle prescription was age 7.0 for the HMG and age 10.5 for the LMG (p = 0.025). The mean deviation on 10-2 threshold VF in the HMG was 0.48+/-0.87 dB and 1.09+/-0.61 dB in the LMG (p = 0.238). Conclusion(s): While the mean deviation for the HMG was lower than the LMG, it did not reach statistical significance. The normative database of the perimeter should control for age related decreased sensitivity so any other difference would likely be due to anatomical and/or physiological differences as it relates to myopia severity. Future work entails testing 10-2 threshold visual fields in a larger sample and exploring other factors such as retinal and choroidal thickness in relation to contrast sensitivity or other visual function beyond visual acuity.

N2  - Purpose: Measurement of peripheral refraction has the potential for predicting development of myopia. The detection of retinal shape abnormalities associated with disease could also provide other information such as swelling caused by wet AMD, or retinal distortion associated with posterior staphyloma. Method(s): The CLARUSTM 500 fundus camera (ZEISS, Dublin, CA) uses slit-scanning technology to illuminate the retina with horizontal strips of light entering at the top and bottom of the pupil, providing the potential for measuring eye shape. By measuring the relative vertical shift on the retina between the upper and lower illuminations using prototype software, we were able to map the vertical refraction across the full field of view of the imager. As this measurement is affected by the field curvature inherent in the optical design, we model this curvature as a function of camera focus and remove it from the measurement. To demonstrate the accuracy and repeatability of the mapping, we created a spherical test eye with rings alternating between 9.5 and 10 diopters of hyperopia, and measured it with focal settings of the camera ranging from 0 to 11 diopters. We then measured human eyes, generating both the peripheral refraction maps and corresponding fundus images. Result(s): The horizontal meridian from the test eye peripheral refraction map with the fundus camera set to 10 diopters is shown in Figure a). As can be seen in the plot, the refraction oscillates between roughly 9.5 and 10 diopters as expected. Figure b) shows the peripheral refraction map from a 1D hyperopic human subject, with the corresponding fundus image in Figure c). The fundus image was generated using the peripheral refraction data so as to ensure co-alignment. Conclusion(s): The slit-scanning fundus camera technology can be used for mapping peripheral refraction. This has potential applications for both myopia research and clinical diagnosis, and for evaluation of any other diseases that might affect retinal shape.

N2  - Purpose : To determine the prevalence of anisometropia of > 3 mm and associated factors among highly myopic (HM) patients. Methods : We retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of staphylomatous high myopia patients (<= -6.00 D and/or > 25 mm axial length (AL) in at least 1 eye) who were seen a High Myopia Clinic between 1/2017-11/2017. All patients underwent dilated retinal exam, AL measurement, fundus photography/autofluorescence, and widefield swept source optical coherence tomography. Results : 126 patients (89 female, 62 +/- 13 years old, range 19-88) were included. Overall, when excluding unilateral eyes < 25 mm, AL was 29.6 +/- 2.3 mm (25-36.7 mm). Severity of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) according to the Meta-PM classification was MMD Category (MMDCat) 1 in 48 eyes (20%), MMDCat2 in 83 (34%), MMDCat3 in 78 (32%) and MMDCat4 in 37 (15%). Among the 251 HM eyes, 44 had (18%) foveoschisis, 34 (14%) CNV, 10 (4%) macular/lamellar hole, 17 (7%) vitreomacular adhesion and 26 (10%) dome-shaped macula. Twenty of 126 patients (16%) had high anisometropia of >= 3 mm AL (range 3-11.2 mm). Of these 20 patients, among the shorter eye: AL was 26.0 +/- 2.1 mm (23.3-30.24 mm), 2 eyes (10%) had peripapillary staphyloma, 1 (5%) had dome-shaped macula, 6 (30%) had wide macular staphyloma and the remaining 11 eyes had no staphyloma, Of the 5 eyes with AL < 24 mm, 3 were MMDCat0/1, however 1 was MMDCat3 with foveoschisis and Fuch's spot, and 1 was MMDCat4 with dome-shaped macula and myopic choroidal neovascularization. Conclusions : The shorter eyes in HM patients with anisometropia (based on refraction or AL alone) may have shorter AL attributable to dome-shaped macula or an eccentric, nonfoveal location of the staphyloma apex, and therefore are also at risk of MMD changes.

N2  - Purpose : To investigate the quantitative and qualitative association of axial length (AL) and prevalence of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) among Chinese- Americans. Methods : The CHES is population-based cross-sectional study on self-identified Chinese-Americans, aged 50 years and older. Participants underwent an interview, clinical exam, ophthalmic exam; and stereoscopic fundus photography. MMD was assessed in a masked manner by an expert grader. A modified version of the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) was used to define MMD that included presence of tessellation, diffuse and patchy chorioretinal atrophy, atrophic macula, lacquer cracks, choroidal neovascularization, and Fuch's spots. Multiple logistic regressions was used and odds ratios and 95% Confidence intervals [OR, (95% CI)] were calculated to examine the association of MMD and axial length. Other socio-demographic, clinical and ocular predictors of MMD were tested as potential confounders and effect-modifiers. Final model included AL, age and sex. To assess the qualitative nature of the relationship between the predictors and MMD, we performed locally weighted (Lowess) regression with slope calculations on the Lowess fitted curves for each consecutive unit of AL. Results : Out of the 1523 myopes in CHES, 490 (32.2%) had MMD. After adjusting for age, sex and severity of myopia, AL was statistically significantly associated with MMD prevalence [OR=2.6 (2.4, 3.0) per each mm longer AL]. Lowess analysis was suggestive of a minimal difference in predicted prevalence of MMD between 20-25 mm of AL. From 25 mm onwards, there was substantially higher MMD prevalence for longer AL (slope24-25=0.09 vs slope25-26=0.27). All participants with an axial length of 31 or more had evidence of MMD. The results were similar when the analysis was repeated for males and females, separately. Conclusions : In this cohort of Chinese- Americans, longer axial length was an independent risk factor for prevalent MMD. Eye care providers should be aware that Chinese Americans with axial lengths higher than 25 mm have a substantially high risk of having MMD and therefore, should consider conducting detailed retinal exams or referring patients to a retina specialist for evaluation.

N2  - Purpose : To determine the prevalence, risk factors and impact of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) on visual impairment and functioning among adults in Singapore. Methods : In this population-based Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) Study, adults (40-80 years) with no history of cataract, refractive surgery or missing refraction but gradable fundus photographs were included. Eye examinations included refraction, axial length and visual acuity (VA) measurements. From fundus photographs, MMD was graded using the Meta-PM classification. The association between MMD and each risk factor was assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. Vision-specific functioning (VSF) was assessed with the VF-11 questionnaire validated using Rasch analysis. Results : A total of 8,846 subjects were included (33.4% Malay, 33.2% Indian and 33.4% Chinese) with a mean age (+/- SD) of 57.4 +/- 9.7 years. Low (-3.0 diopters [D] < spherical equivalent [SE] <= -0.5 D), moderate (-5.0 D < SE <= -3.0 D) and high myopia (SE <= -5.0 D) was present in 24.9%, 6.1% and 5.9% of subjects, respectively. The age-standardized prevalence of MMD was 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-4.7%). The prevalence of MMD increased with severity of myopia (9.1 %, 10.5% and 28.6%, among low, moderate and high myopes, respectively, p-trend <0.001). Of 405 subjects with MMD, 93.1% had Meta-PM category 2, and 6.9% had either Meta-PM category 3 or 4. Risk factors associated with MMD included older age (p<0.001), higher myopic SE (p<0.001), Malay ethnicity (p=0.008) and primary/lower education (p=0.006). The prevalence of MMD increased non-linearly (logistic function) with SE and age. Approximately 1 in 5 subjects with MMD had low vision or blindness in at least one eye (US definition). Subjects with patchy or macular atrophy in the better-seeing eye had worse best-corrected VA (beta of 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.15, p<0.001) and poorer VSF (beta of -10.4; 95% CI, -19.3-1.5, p=0.02) than those without MMD after multivariate adjustments with presenting VA and other confounders. Conclusions : The prevalence of MMD in Singapore is one of the highest worldwide and severe MMD has a substantial impact on vision loss and functioning. As MMD risks increase with older age and myopic SE, older adults with myopia should be monitored and cared for regularly.

N2  - Purpose : To compare eye shape across the refractive error range using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images in Singapore adults. Methods : A total of 450 participants aged 50 years and above (64.2 +/- 6.5 years old) in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Disease (SEED) study (169 Chinese, 165 Indians and 116 Malays) were included. Refraction was performed using an autorefractor, and axial length (AL) was measured using optical biometry (IOLMaster, Zeiss). The MRI volumes (3T Magnetom Trio Tim; Siemens) of the right eye were semi-automatically segmented in the axial planes, and posterior eye radius of curvature (Rc) (related to total eye volume) and asphericity (Qxz with > 0 as oblate, < 0 as prolate) were calculated. Multivariate liner regression models were used to identify Rc and Qxz and associations with spherical equivalent (SE) and AL, controlling for confounders. Results : Among 441 eligible subjects, the prevalence of myopia (-0.50 Diopter (D) > SE) and high myopia (-5.00D > SE) were 25.6% and 3.6%, respectively. Rc was correlated positively with AL (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.56) and negatively with SE (r = -0.27). Qxz was correlated negatively with AL (r=-0.50) and positively with SE (r=0.44). Both larger eye volume and prolate eye shape were correlated with longer AL and worse SE. Multivariable regression analysis revealed that larger eye volume, (larger Rc) was associated with worse SE (B = -1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.3 to -1.3, p < 0.001)), longer AL (B =1.4, CI 1.2 to 1.6, p < 0.001) and myopia (odds ratio (OR) = 4.3, CI 2.6 to 7.42, p < 0.001). Lower Qxz indicating increasing axial prolateness was also associated with worse SE (B = 6.6, CI 5.6 to 7.9, p < 0.001), longer AL (B= -3.5, CI -4.0 to -3.0, p < 0.001) and myopia (p<0.001). Comparison among 3 groups with different SE: Non-myopia (SE > -0.50 D), mild-moderate myopia (-0.50 D > SE > -5.00 D) and high myopia (SE < -5.00 D) showed only 10% of mild-moderate myopic eyes were prolate, >50% of high myopic eyes were prolate. Conclusions : We have demonstrated that eye volume and the prolate eye shape were associated with myopic eyes, and that the prolate changes of myopic eyes become more prominent in the group with high myopia. Clinically, our findings are important because eye shape may be an important imaging biomarker for high myopia and pathologic myopia changes.

N2  - Purpose : To investigate the influence of foveal curvature on the myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and its relevance to surgical outcome after pars plana vitrectomy. Methods : High myopes (axial length >= 26.5 mm, myopic refractive error >= -6 D) with posterior staphyloma were recruited. Three different parameters of foveal curvature were calculated based on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hyperreflective line using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. The mean values of the curvature parameters in patients with MTM were compared with the patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) or those without MTM and mCNV. For the patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy for the treatment of MTM, surgical outcome and its association with foveal curvature were assessed. Results : A total of 85 high myopic eyes with MTM were included. The axial length, refractive error, and distribution of the staphyloma types were comparable to mCNV group or controls. The means of all three curvature parameters were significantly higher in the MTM group than in the mCNV and control groups (all P's < 0.001). In MTM patients, foveal curvature parameters had significant correlation with axial length, but not with foveoschisis height (FSH). In 55 eyes which underwent pars plana vitrectomy, FSH decreased from 548.5 +/- 201.9 mum at baseline to 278.0 +/- 106.8 mum at 1 month, 245.7 +/- 93.7 mum at 3 months, 222.6 +/- 146.2 mum at 6 months, 185.2 +/- 59.4 mum at 12 months. Complete resolution of foveoschisis and foveal reattachment was achieved in 87.3% at 12 months after surgery, and was associated with complete removal of tractional elements at vitreoretinal interface rather than with foveal curvature. Conclusions : The results suggested that a steeper change of foveal curvature plays a role in the development of MTM in high myopic patients, but foveal curvature itself is not the determinant of surgical success after vitrectomy. The evaluation of foveal curvature might be useful in predicting the development of MTM.

N2  - Purpose : Limited data exists regarding a comparison of efficacy of anti-VEGF agents in treatment of mCNV. We performed a retrospective clinical study to compare anatomical and functional outcomes of treatment with bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections. Methods : We studied 85 eyes with mCNV treated with bevacizumab and 125 eyes treated with ranibizumab injections at Moorfields Eye Hospital between 2009 and 2016. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were collected at baseline, after 3, 6, 12, 24 months and the last visit. Baseline OCT scans, photographs and fluorescein angiograms were analyzed to identify staphyloma, dome-shaped maculopathy, myopic tractional maculopathy, Fuchs' spot, lacquer cracks, retinal haemorrhage, intra-/subretinal fluid, size and location of CNV and a grade of macular maculopathy. Generalized estimating equations analysis was used to study BCVA and CRT changes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine incidence and risk factors of a CNV recurrence. Results : Baseline BCVA was 0.62+/-0.04 logMAR and 0.61+/-0.04 logMAR in the bevacizumab and ranibizumab group, respectively and improved at the last visit by 0.22 logMAR (p<0.001) in the bevacizumab-treated eyes and 0.16 logMAR (p<0.001) in the ranibizumabtreated eyes. At baseline CRT was 309+/-10 mum and 326+/-9 mum in the bevacizumab and ranibizumab group, respectively and reduced by 63 mum (p<0.001) in the bevacizumab- and 52 mum (p<0.001) in the ranibizumab-treated eyes. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding BCVA and CRT at any time point. The mean time to a CNV recurrence was 66.1+/-3.7 and 57.3+/-6.4 months in the bevacizumab and ranibizumab group, respectively (p=0.001). Risk factors for incidence of CNV recurrence included baseline CNV area (aHR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.0-1.32), subfoveal CNV location (aHR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.16-3.93) and treatment with ranibizumab (aHR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.16-3.93). Conclusions : In conclusion, this study shows that eyes with mCNV treated with bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections can achieve similar anatomical and functional improvement. However, treatment with ranibizumab can lead to a higher incidence of CNV recurrence.

N2  - Purpose: The relative contribution of retina and choroid to the pathogenesis of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) is unclear. In order to clarify it, the association of choroidal vasculature, retinal microstructure, and retinal microvascular network with MMD were investigated. Method(s): Prospective research. Thirty-two eyes of 23 patients with high myopia (<-6.0D or axial length > 26.5mm) were included. MMD was graded according to the International Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) classification. OCT system (Optovue RTVue XR Avanti; Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) with a custom automated algorithm software was used to measure choroidal thickness (CT), retinal thickness (RT), vascular densities of superficial and deep retinal capillary layers (SRCL and DRCL), which presented the choroidal vasculature, retinal microstructure and retinal microvascular network, respectively. Result(s): There were 19 eyes in category 1, 8 eyes in category 2 and 5 eyes in category 3. Correlation of MMD severity was significantly strong for CT (r =-0.830, p < 0.001), and significant but less strong for RT (r =-0.576, p < 0.001). The vascular density of SRCL was correlated with the MMD severity (r =-0.362, p = 0.032), however no significant correlation was found between the vascular density of DRCL and MMD severity (r =-0.161, p = 0.211). A stepwise multiple linear regression analysis to determine the explanatory variables most strongly associated with MMD among CT, RT and SRCL. CT (p =-0.658, p < 0.001) and RT (p =-0.311, p = 0.019) were the variables associated significantly with MMD, and SRCL wasn't a significant predictor of MMD. Conclusion(s): Among choroidal vasculature, retinal microstructure and retinal microvascular network, we demonstrated that choroidal vasculature has the strongest correlation with MMD severity. This suggested progressive atrophy of choroid may play a more important role in the development of MMD. OCT system could be a useful tool to differentiate MMD severity and clarify the mechanism of MMD.

N2  - Purpose: Patients of Asian descent are at a higher risk of developing myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV), a vision-threatening complication of pathological myopia. This post-RADIANCE retrospective cohort study assessed the long-term eficacy, safety, and treatment burden of intravitreal 0.5 mg ranibizumab (RBZ) in East Asian patients with mCNV over the 36 months following the 12-month, phase 3 RADIANCE trial (NCT01217944). Method(s): The RADIANCE trial compared verteporfin photodynamic therapy vs 2 treatment regimens of 0.5 mg RBZ in patients with mCNV: guided by either disease activity or visual stability criteria. The post-RADIANCE retrospective analysis examined the safety and eficacy of RBZ in patients of East Asian descent who completed RADIANCE and attended at least 1 follow-up visit in the 36 months (M13-48) following the trial. The primary outcome measure was mean BCVA change from baseline to each visit over the 36- month follow-up study. Secondary outcome measures included recurrence of mCNV in the study eye and ocular adverse events (AEs) during the 36-month follow-up. Result(s): In this retrospective analysis of post-RANDIANCE patients (N=41; 14.8% of RADIANCE), mean BCVA gains from RADIANCE baseline were 14.3 +/- 11.4 ETDRS letters (n=40; P < 0.0001) at M12, and were maintained through the follow-up period to 16.3 +/- 18.7 (n=16, P = 0.0034) at M48. From M13-48, only 7 patients (17.1%) required additional anti-VEGF injections (5.0 +/- 5.9; group A), while 34 (82.9%) did not (group B). The mean central retinal thickness (CRT; mum) in groups A and B in the post-RADIANCE study period was comparable (379.0 +/- 72.8 and 382.1 +/- 108.6). Of the 41 patients in the follow-up study, 4 patients had recurrences (2 reactivations of previously regressed mCNV and 2 newly formed). Of these, 2 (4.9%) experienced a single episode, 2 (4.9%) had a second recurrence. No patients experienced a third recurrence during the follow-up study. Ocular AEs were reported in 5 (12.2%) patients, however, none were considered serious or related to RBZ treatment. Conclusion(s): The significant vision gains achieved in East Asian mCNV patients with RBZ treatment at M12 were maintained over an additional 36-month period with only a minority of patients requiring additional injections. Few patients experienced recurrence of mCNV. No new safety findings were reported.

N2  - Purpose: To determine predictive factors for achieving good vision (20/40 or better) at months (M) 3 and 12 in patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) due to pathologic myopia, treated with ranibizumab (RBZ) in the phase 3, 12-month RADIANCE trial (NCT01217944). Method(s): The RADIANCE trial compared verteporfin photodynamic therapy, the previous standard treatment for mCNV, vs 0.5 mg RBZ in patients with mCNV; RBZ re-treatment was guided by either visual stability (group I) or disease activity (group II). In this post hoc analysis, the association between baseline ocular/demographic characteristics and good vision outcomes at M3 and M12 was examined by univariate and multivariate analyses individually and on pooled groups I and II. Result(s): In the RADIANCE trial, 217 patients were randomized to groups I (n=104) and II (n=113), respectively. Treatment with RBZ resulted in rapid vision improvement, with both groups gaining > 2 lines of vision at M12. Based on the univariate analyses on pooled groups I and II, baseline BCVA, age, central retinal thickness (CRT), central foveal thickness (CFT), area of lesion, area of CNV, location of CNV, and CNV subtype in study eye were significant predictors for achieving 20/40 vision at M3 and M12 (all P < 0.05). The presence of intraretinal edema and fuchs spots (both P < 0.05) was associated with good vision at M3 only. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed baseline BCVA, CFT, and area of lesion (all P < 0.05) were predictive of good vision at M3. For every 10-mum increase in CFT, the odds of good vision at M3 decreased by 5% (OR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99). For every mm2 increase in area of lesion, the odds of good vision at M3 decreased by 29% (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.90). Only baseline BCVA (P < 0.0001) was predictive of good vision at M12. For every additional letter in baseline BCVA, the odds of good vision increased by 17% (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.24) for M3 and 13% (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.18) for M12. Conclusion(s): Several baseline factors in addition to prompt treatment with RBZ were useful in predicting a good response to treatment in patients with mCNV in the RADIANCE trial. These findings were consistent regardless of whether treatment was guided by visual stability or disease activity. There will be more analyses in the near future to assess predictive factors of good vision.

N2  - Purpose: Anti-VEGF drugs have been widely used as the first-line treatments for patients with age-related macular degeneration, myopic choroidal neovascularization, retinal vein occlusion and diabetic maculopathy, and ranibizumab was approved for diabetic retinopathy without maculopathy. Intravitreally injected anti-VEGF drugs were associated with high incidence of systemic thromboembolic events in heart, brain, gastro intestine, or kidney, so it is important to assess their risks before treatments. We intravitreously inject anti-VEGF drugs in up to 500 eyes per month for years. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed records of anti-VEGF treatments to estimate the incidence of adverse effects from anti-VEGF therapy. Method(s): Medical records of individuals who received intravitreal injections of aflibercept or ranibizumab after approval by Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, were collected. Data included age, sex, diagnosis, smoking status, previous medical history, usage of antiplatelet, and anticoagulant medicine. The study was reviewed by Nagoya University institutional review board, and participants had chances to opt-out. Result(s): From March 2009 to March 2017, total of 19,523 injections were performed at Nagoya University Hospital to 2,753 patients, and 565 patients among them received both of ranibizumab and aflibercept. Although this survey had a limitation because it was retrospective and based on medical records, we provide long-term data of anti-VEGF intravitreous injections. Conclusion(s): We experienced several thromboembolic cases, still intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF were relatively safe in Japanese patients.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm for detecting referable glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) and late wet age-related macular degeneration (LW-AMD) based on color fundus photographs. Method(s): A deep learning system for automated classification of GON and LW-AMD was developed based on more than 50,000 fundus photographs. A total of 21 trained ophthalmologists were invited to label all these images using an online cloud source system. Referable GON was defined as vertical cup/disc ratio >= 0.7 and other typical changes of GON. AMD was classified as absent, early, intermediate, late dry and late wet subtypes. The reference standard was made when >=3 graders had achieved agreement. A separate validation dataset of 8,000 fully gradable fundus photographs was used to assess the performance of this algorithm. Result(s): In the validation dataset, this deep learning system achieved an AUC of 0.986 with sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 92.0% for GON; these results were 0.995, 98.0% and 94.0% for LW-AMD, respectively. The most common reasons for false negative grading (n=87) for GON were co-existing eye conditions (n=44, 50.6%) while the reason for false positive cases (n=480) was having other eye conditions (n=458, 95.4%), mainly including physiologic cupping (n=267, 55.6%). For the misclassification of LW-AMD, serous detachment of the sensory retina or retinal pigment epithelium (n=8, 57.2%) were identified as the most common features in the false negative classification. Images with other eye diseases (n=145, 76.3%), such as diabetic retinopathy (n=38, 20%), myopic maculopathy (n=22, 11.5%), early or intermediate AMD (n=21, 11.1%) and choroiditis (n=12, 6.3%), were the commonest features for false positive classification. Conclusion(s): A deep learning system can detect referable GON and LW-AMD with high sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm should be further validated among the images collected in real-world clinical practice.

N2  - Introduction/Background: Myopic Choroidal Neovascularisation (CNV) is the most common sight threatening complication of pathological myopia and a common cause of blindness in people of working age. In 2013 United Kingdom national guidance recommended ranibuzumab for treating CNV, as supported by data from phase II (REPAIR) and phase III (RADIANCE) trials. Method(s): Uncontrolled retrospective study using electronic patient record data from a UK University Eye Hospital. Data extracted included best measured visual acuity (BMVA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurement of central retinal thickness (CRT) at baseline and at key time points in treatment course. Result(s): The mean BMVA letter score and standard error at baseline (n = 57), 12 and 24 months was 53 (2.3), 64.9 (2.5) and 65.3 (3.5) respectively. Mean and standard error OCT CRT at baseline (n = 39), 12 and 24 months was 307.1 mum (13.3), 251 mum (10.2) and 235.2 mum (12.5) respectively. In the first year, there was a mean visit rate of 9.2, decreasing to 7.7 in the second year. The mean number of intravitreal Ranibuzumab injections required in the first and second year were 4.5 and 2.3 respectively. No known serious adverse effects were identified. Conclusion(s): The improvement in BMVA and reduction in mean CRT supports the continued use of intravitreal Ranibuzumab therapy for the management of Myopic CNV. Further work is required to identify the optimal frequency of monitoring, the effects of age on response to treatment and explanations for required prolonged treatment courses.

N2  - Background: Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) play pivotal roles in the development of GnRH neurons and the olfactory system. Loss-of-function mutations in FGFR1 have been reported in isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) and Kallmann syndrome (KS). (1) Recently, FGFR1 abnormalities have also been identified in patients with Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) and combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD).(2) Herein, we report a case with SOD phenotype which was found to have novel FGFR1 gene mutation. Clinical case: A 25-year-old man was referred to investigate about his delayed puberty and tall statue. He was also noted about his delayed development with mental retardation (IQ 50) and high myopia with posterior staphyloma. Physical examination showed dysmorphic features including microcephaly, hypertelorism and high arch palate. His height was 180 cm (mid parental height 162.5-178.5 cm), upper: lower ratio segment 82:98= 0.83 arm span 185 cm and body weight of 69.8 kg. Physical examination revealed bilateral gynecomastia, small penis, soft and small testes and sparse his pubic hair (tanner II). Hormonal studies revealed low testosterone of 0.3 nmol/L (5.9-24.7), LH 0.1 IU/L (1-10.5) and FSH 0.2 IU/L (1-8.4). Other pituitary hormones including prolactin, FT4/ TSH, IGF-I and cortisol were within normal ranges. His magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed markedly small size of bilateral olfactory nerves and bulbs, flattening of pituitary gland with 2.8 mm in height. Agenesis of the corpus callosum, absent of cingulate sulcus and gyrus was observed. Both optic nerves and the optic chiasm appeared normal. His karyotype was 46 XY. Sequencing candidate genes for SOD and KS including HESX1 KAL1 KISS1 KISS1R and GNRHR, were normal.(3) A heterozygous mutation in exon 3 of FGFR1 gene, c.203 G > A, resulting in arginine to glycine substitution at codon 68 (p.R68Q) was identified. This variant was predicted to be damaging based on SIFT and Polyphen prediction tools. (SIFT score 0 and Polyphen score 0.814). Conclusion(s): A novel FGFR1 mutation was identified in the patient with SOD phenotype who had an isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This result supports that KS and SOD are genetically related conditions caused by abnormal development of the anterior midline in the forebrain.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Macular neovascular diseases can cause severe vision loss. A newly approved anti-VEGF drug Conbercept has shown good efficacy and safety in rigorous random controlled trials (RCT), however, it cannot fully reflect the clinical application of Conbercept in real world clinical practice. Moreover, anti-VEGF drugs are expensive and often require multiple treatments, and some patients have poor or even no response to the drugs,this resulted enormous waste of medical resources. Therefore, how to find out those patients who have good response, and how to develop individualized therapeutic regimen in real world need to be urgently investigated in the aspect of pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics., METHODS: This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational study of Conbecept treating macular neovascular diseases in China. Patients suffered from age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, and pathological myopia who already planned to receive Conbercept treatment will be recruited. We aimed to enroll more than 5000 patients from 43 ophthalmic centers in China. Patients' clinical data and blood samples will be collected during the one-year follow-up period. Finally, the safety and efficacy of Conbercept, and the potential predictors of patients' response to Conbercept will be investigated by pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics analysis., DISCUSSION: This study will provide important data of Conbercept in treating macular neovascular diseases in real world. Besides, finding the predictor of patients' response will help doctor make more precise individualized therapeutic regimens., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03128463 .

N2  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate inner retinal dimples after peeling of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) for macular holes (lamellar macular hole [LMH] and full-thickness macular hole [FTMH]) via multiple imaging modes of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to assess their relationship with preoperative vitreoretinal interface conditions., METHODS: The data of 38 eyes in 35 patients who underwent surgery for LMH, and FTMH were retrospectively studied. The presence of postoperative inner retinal dimples was judged by a combination of en face OCT layer images and cross-sectional images. The demographic and clinical characteristics of eyes with and without inner retinal defects were compared to identify factors involved in the formation of the defects., RESULTS: Inner retinal defects were found in 26 eyes (68%) after surgery. They appeared on the en face OCT ILM layer images as multiple dark spots limited to the ILM peeling area, and corresponded to dimples or pitting of inner retinal layers on cross-sectional OCT images. In 5 cases (19%), apparent progression of inner retinal defects was observed on the en face OCT images as increasing numbers and sizes of the dark spots, which seemed to follow an eccentric growth pattern starting from the central macula. In addition, highly myopic eyes were found to be associated with the formation of more severe inner retinal defects., CONCLUSIONS: Multiple imaging modes of en face spectral-domain OCT provide comprehensive information about the appearance of inner retinal dimples. High myopic eyes seem to develop more severe inner retinal defects after ILM peeling.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) in highly myopic eyes was found to be correlated with increasing age, refractive error (spherical equivalent), and axial length. Which factor is the most significant predictor of SFCT remains controversial., METHODS: A hospital-based cohort of highly myopic eyes (with spherical equivalent equal to or over 6.00 diopter) were retrospectively screened. Data from only right eye in those bilateral high myopia, and unilateral high myopia in any eye, were used for analysis. Correlations among the four biometric factors were analyzed. Linear correlation was performed to analyze the predictors of SFCT., RESULTS: A cohort of 312 eyes from 312 adults (98 men) was enrolled. Statistical analysis showed that axial length (R =-0.592), spherical equivalent (R =-0.471), and age (R =-0.296) were significantly correlated with SFCT (P <0.001). No significant correlation was found between age and axial length, or age and spherical equivalent. Partial correlation with controlled age confirmed that axial length (R =-0.628) was a more significant predictor of SFCT than spherical equivalent (R =-0.507)., CONCLUSIONS: SFCT was inversely correlated with increasing age, spherical equivalent and axial length, with axial length as the most significant predictor of SFCT, in adult highly myopic eyes.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term endothelial tolerance of iris-fixated phakic intraocular lenses (pIOLs) over a 10-year period, to identify predictive factors for endothelial decompensation, and to develop a model to predict endothelial cell survival after pIOL implantation., METHODS: This retrospective study included 130 eyes in 60 patients who underwent pIOL implantation for correction of high myopia from January 2003 to October 2012 at Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon, France. Endothelial cell densities (ECDs) were measured using specular microscopy before and biannually after pIOL implantation. Best-corrected visual acuity was measured before and 6 months after pIOL implantation. The annual postoperative decrease in ECD was estimated using a mixed linear regression model with a random intercept. Patient and eye characteristics were introduced into the model to quantify their effect on ECD change. The main outcome measures were annual postoperative reduction of ECD and best-corrected visual acuity., RESULTS: The preoperative ECD was 2770 +/- 265 cells/mm (2134-3200 cells/mm). The ECD decreased by 1.83%, on average (95% confidence interval, 1.54-2.10), during the first postoperative year. Thereafter, the mean decrease in annual ECD was estimated to be 0.87% (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.95). For a cell number of 3500, 3000, 2500, and 2000, the number of years required to reach the threshold of 1500 cells/mm was estimated to be approximately 96, 78, 57, and 32 years, respectively. No predictive factors for endothelial decompensation were identified., CONCLUSIONS: pIOL implantation is a safe surgical means to correct high myopia in phakic patients without compromising corneal endothelium survival.

N2  - Based on the Beijing Eye Study 2011, a detailed ophthalmic examination was performed including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) with enhanced depth imaging for measurement of subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and relative height of posterior scleral staphyloma. OCT images were obtained in 103 highly myopic eyes (<=-6.00 diopters) and 227 normal eyes. The mean SFCT in highly myopic eyes was 110.6+/-85.2 mum (range, 3 to 395 mum). The SFCT of high myopia without posterior scleral staphyloma(55 eyes) was 157.79+/-85.18 mum, which was significantly greater than that (54.94+/-49.96mum) of high myopia with posterior scleral staphyloma (48 eyes) (P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, posterior scleral staphyloma was the most important factor of choroidal thinning in high myopia (F=22.63; P<0.001), then age (F=19.14; P<0.001), axial length (F=17.37; P<0.001) and gender (F=17.31; P<0.001). The SFCT in highly myopic eyes is very thin and undergoes further thinning with increasing age and axial length (refractive error). Posterior staphyloma formation was a key factor in choroidal thinning in highly myopic eyes and to be a good indicator for risk management of choroidal thinning. Abnormalities of the choroid may play a role in the pathogenesis of myopic degeneration.

N2  - Pathologic myopia is a leading cause of visual impairment. Development of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is one of the most common complications that leads to central vision loss in patients with pathologic myopia. If left untreated, it can cause scarring with expanding macular atrophy leading to irreversible visual loss in a period as short as 5 years. Advancements in multimodal imaging technology have furthered our understanding of the condition; however, further studies are necessary to extend its utility in the diagnosis of myopic CNV. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy has become the standard-of-care and the recommended first-line treatment option for myopic CNV. Long-term studies have demonstrated that early treatment of confirmed myopic CNV cases with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent is useful to avoid late-stage complications. This strategy has also been shown to achieve visual outcome improvements for up to 4 years and visual stabilization up to 6 years. This review article provides an overview of the current knowledge on myopic CNV and discusses recent updates in the diagnosis and management of the condition. Furthermore, treatment recommendations are provided based on the authors' expert opinions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - There is an epidemic of myopia in East and Southeast Asia, with the prevalence of myopia in young adults around 80-90%, and an accompanying high prevalence of high myopia in young adults (10-20%). This may foreshadow an increase in low vision and blindness due to pathological myopia. These two epidemics are linked, since the increasingly early onset of myopia, combined with high progression rates, naturally generates an epidemic of high myopia, with high prevalences of "acquired" high myopia appearing around the age of 11-13. The major risk factors identified are intensive education, and limited time outdoors. The localization of the epidemic appears to be due to the high educational pressures and limited time outdoors in the region, rather than to genetically elevated sensitivity to these factors. Causality has been demonstrated in the case of time outdoors through randomized clinical trials in which increased time outdoors in schools has prevented the onset of myopia. In the case of educational pressures, evidence of causality comes from the high prevalence of myopia and high myopia in Jewish boys attending Orthodox schools in Israel compared to their sisters attending religious schools, and boys and girls attending secular schools. Combining increased time outdoors in schools, to slow the onset of myopia, with clinical methods for slowing myopic progression, should lead to the control of this epidemic, which would otherwise pose a major health challenge. Reforms to the organization of school systems to reduce intense early competition for accelerated learning pathways may also be important.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate functional prognostic factors and neuroretinal changes after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in patients with naive, recent myopic neovascularization (mCNV), as assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Method(s): Specific changes in tomographic features between baseline and final follow-up were retrospectively evaluated by two examiners independently. Imaging was obtained by a multi-modal imaging system which combines fluorescein angiography and SD-OCT. Result(s): Twenty-two eyes (male, six; female, 16; mean age, 65 +/- 14 years) were considered. Mean follow-up was 21.5 +/- 14 months. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved from 0.38 +/- 0.26 to 0.16 +/- 0.20 logMAR (p < 0.001). The ellipsoid zone and the external limiting membrane (ELM) were disrupted in 21 (95.5%) and 15 (68.2%) eyes at baseline, and in 16 (72.7%) and nine (40.9%) eyes after therapy respectively. The ellipsoid zone and ELM were typically intact at lesion margins in 13 (59.1%) and 19 eyes (86.5%) respectively at baseline. The inner retina was intact in 20 eyes (91%). Six eyes (27.3%) exhibited complete regression without fibrosis. Absence of hemorrhage and integrity of lesion-adjacent ELM and of lesion-adjacent ellipsoid zone at baseline were factors for better final BCVA (p <= 0.05) Conclusion(s): Vision gain might occur despite ellipsoid zone or ELM restoration. Hemorrhage could be considered a negative prognostic factor, integrity of lesion-adjacent ELM and of lesion-adjacent ellipsoid zone as positive prognostic factors. Myopic CNV can also resolve completely without fibrosis.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - PURPOSE. To examine the association between intraocular pressure (IOP) and the prevalence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) in high myopia. METHODS. The hospital-based observational study consisted of patients treated in the Tokyo High Myopia Clinics and for whom fundus photographs and IOP readings were available. The appearance of the optic nerve head on fundus photographs was the basis for the definition of GON. RESULTS. Among 517 eyes of 261 patients (mean age: 62.1 +/- 14.2 years; range: 13-89 years; mean axial length: 29.5 +/- 2.2 mm; range: 23.2-35.3 mm), GON was present in 141 eyes (27.3%; 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 23.4, 31.0). Mean IOP did not differ significantly (P = 0.53) between the glaucoma group (14.5 +/- 3.3 mm Hg; median: 14 mm Hg; range: 8-38 mm Hg) and the nonglaucomatous group (14.7 +/- 2.5 mm Hg; median: 14 mm Hg; range: 6-23 mm Hg). In eyes with an axial length of <=27.4 mm, higher presence of GON was correlated only with higher IOP (P = 0.037; odds ratio [OR]: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.80). In eyes with an axial length of >=27.5 mm, presence of GON was correlated with older age (P < 0.001; OR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.08), longer axial length (P < 0.001; OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.91), shorter vertical diameter of the temporal arterial arcade (P = 0.009; OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.95), and longer minimal optic disc diameter (P = 0.002; OR: 3.07; 95% CI: 1.52, 6.21). If IOP was added to the model, it was not significantly associated with the prevalence of GON (P = 0.97; OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.10). CONCLUSIONS. GON was associated with elevated IOP in myopic eyes with an axial length of <=27.4 mm, while in more highly myopic eyes (axial length >=27.5 mm), larger optic disc, longer axial elongation and older age-but not IOP mostly within its normal range-were factors associated with GON. Future studies may examine an abnormally low IOP to be associated with a lower GON prevalence in highly myopic eyes.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate changes in the anterior segment of myopic eyes and assess anterior biometry as a function of axial length (AL). Design(s): Retrospective investigational study. Participant(s): Patients evaluated for phakic intraocular lens surgery at a tertiary eye care centre. Method(s): Patients with corrected visual acuity > 20/40 and AL > 24.5 mm were included in the study. Posterior staphyloma and maculopathy were ruled out in all the patients, and 176 eyes were included for analysis. AL was measured with partial coherence interferometry, while keratometry, central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and horizontal white to white (WTW) were measured with slit-scanning topography. Group 1 included 55 eyes with AL < 26.5 mm, group 2 had 57 eyes with AL between 26.5 and 28.5 mm while group 3 had 64 eyes with AL > 28.5 mm. Main Outcome Measure(s): Correlation of AL with anterior biometry. Result(s): The mean AL of the study eyes was 27.88 + 2.14 mm. The mean values of ACD (2.99 mm), CCT (0.52 mm), WTW (11.68 mm), and keratometry (43.62 D) were within the normal range. Overall, very weak correlations could be established between AL and CCT (R = 0.17, p = 0.02), AL and keratometry (R = - 0.28, p < 0.001), and AL and WTW (R = 0.22, p = 0.002), while ACD did not relate to AL significantly. The ACD and CCT did not relate significantly to AL in any of the three groups. Keratometry had a weak negative relation with AL in groups 1 and 2, while WTW had a weakly positive relation with AL in group 2 only. No variable had any significant relation with AL in group 3. Conclusion(s): There is disproportionate elongation of the eyeball in myopic patients with very weak or no correlation between anterior biometry and AL. This discord is more in longer eyes. Such a scenario can be challenging to a refractive surgeon treating highly myopic eyes and needs further evaluation.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

N2  - Purpose: This study investigated factors associated with chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) progression in myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. Method(s): Fifty eyes of 50 treatment-naive patients with myopic CNV who underwent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monotherapy with at least 2 years of follow-up data were included. The cumulative occurrence of CRA progression was assessed using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics including macular choroidal thickness in various areas were compared between patients with and without CRA progression. Result(s): The mean age was 52.34 years. A mean of 4.84 anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections were performed over the mean follow-up duration of 44.6 months. Eventually, 15 eyes (30%) developed CRA progression. The estimated occurrence of CRA progression was 10% at 1 year, 19.1% at 2 years, 23.6% at 3 and 4 years, and 35.4% at 5 years. Chorioretinal atrophy progression was associated with a subfoveal CNV location (P = 0.029) and thinner subfoveal choroid in relation to the inferior choroid at 3 mm (P = 0.008). Visual improvement was only significant in eyes without CRA progression at 1 year, 2 years, and at the final visit. Conclusion(s): Chorioretinal atrophy progression was associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Relative thinning of the subfoveal choroid about the inferior choroid and subfoveal CNV location may predispose eyes with myopic CNV to develop CRA progression after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

N2  - Purpose: To identify the risk factors for the development of macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) after vitrectomy without internal limiting membrane peeling for pathologic MF. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the records of 131 eyes (115 patients) treated with vitrectomy for pathologic MF from 2009 to 2014. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive error, axial length, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography findings were analyzed. Result(s): Postoperative MHRD developed in 7 eyes (5.3%). Between patients with or without secondary MHRD after vitrectomy, there were no significant differences in age, sex, axial length, preoperative BCVA, refractive error, lens status, and presence of posterior staphyloma. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed all 7 eyes (100%) had foveal detachment, while only 47 patients (37.9%) of 124 eyes had foveal detachment (P = 0.004). There was no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative BCVA in the 7 eyes with MHRD. The postoperative BCVA in the 124 eyes without MHRD was significantly improved (P < 0.001). Among the 124 eyes, both preoperative and postoperative BCVA of eyes with foveal detachment was worse than the eyes without foveal detachment (P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion(s): Preoperative foveal detachment is a risk factor for the development of MHRD after vitrectomy for pathologic MF.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the 6-year outcome of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) to treat eyes with active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to pathologic myopia. Method(s): Medical records of 36 eyes of 35 consecutive patients with high myopia (refractive error >=8 D or axial length >=26.5 mm) and active CNV, who had been treated with IVB and followed for >=6 years were analyzed. The factors that predicted the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 6 years after IVB were determined by multiple regression analyses. Result(s): The mean age of the subjects was 58 years, and the mean axial length was 29 mm. Twenty-one eyes had subfoveal CNV and 15 eyes had nonsubfoveal CNV. During the 6-year follow-up, the mean number of IVB was 1.78. The mean BCVA logMAR (equivalent Snellen visual acuity) was 0.50 (20/63), 0.31 (20/40), 0.39 (20/50), and 0.45 (20/63) at the baseline, and at 2, 4, and 6 years after the IVB. The BCVA was significantly improved at 2 and 4 years compared with baseline values but not at 6 years. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that the BVCA at 6 years was significantly correlated with the size of the CNV-related macular atrophy, and the baseline BCVA and CNV size. Conclusion(s): The significant correlation between the BCVA at 6 years and the size of the macular atrophy indicates that treatments to prevent the development of macular atrophy are important for the long-term visual outcome in eyes with active CNV.

T1  - What is the fundamental nature of pathologic myopia?
A1  - Ohno-Matsui K. 
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Purpose: Despite being a major cause of visual impairment worldwide, pathologic myopia has not been clearly and consistently defined. This lack of a standardized definition has made comparisons among epidemiological studies difficult. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to summarize the definitions of pathologic myopia. Method(s): A literature search was conducted of Pubmed to identify reports presenting definitions of pathologic myopia. Result(s): Although cut-off values for refractive error and increased axial length have been used in some studies, a definition based solely on such values is considered to just show a 'high degree of myopia'. Similarly, the presence of myopic fundus lesions in addition to a high degree of myopia has been used to define pathologic myopia; however, such lesions often develop with age and they are not characteristic of pathologic myopia. Conclusion(s): So, what is pathologic myopia? This review covers the various proposed definitions for pathologic myopia, and describes its major features such as posterior staphyloma, variation in axial length, and the presence of myopic maculopathy. Some unanswered questions that serve as signposts to areas of interest for future research have also been discussed.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the ultrastructure of the internal limiting membranes (ILMs) excised during vitrectomy from highly myopic eyes with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). The clinical findings before and after the vitrectomy were compared. Method(s): Seven eyes of 7 patients with macular retinoschisis were studied. Four of these eyes also had a foveal detachment but without a retinal break. All the eyes underwent vitrectomy with the creation of a posterior vitreous detachment and ILM peeling. The excised ILMs were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Result(s): The retinas were reattached in all eyes after the vitrectomy. No retinal breaks including macular holes were identified intraoperatively. Transmission electron microscopy showed glial cells in 4 eyes, retinal pigment epithelium-like cells in 4 eyes, and myofibroblast-like cells in 4 eyes on the excised ILMs. A newly produced basement membrane appeared to merge with the ILM in 5 eyes. Thick collagen was seen in 2 eyes, and fibrous long-spacing collagen in the newly synthesized collagen fibers was seen in 3 eyes. The cellular components of the glial cells appeared to have migrated through the thinner parts of the retina or through a defect of the ILM in 2 eyes. Conclusion(s): Cells that migrate onto the surface of the ILM synthesize new collagen, which can create tangential traction. This may explain the success of vitrectomy with ILM peeling in treating MTM in highly myopic eyes.Copyright © 2017, Japanese Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - PURPOSE. To investigate the potential role of ranibizumab treatment on the development or enlargement of chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) at the posterior pole in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). METHODS. This observational case series included patients having high myopia spherical equivalent refractive error >= -6.00 diopters, axial length (AxL) >= 26.0 mm in both eyes, and mCNV treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg in one eye, who were retrospectively enrolled. Areas of CRA in treated and fellow eyes were measured on fundus autofluorescence images at baseline, 12, and 24 months. The CRA hypoautofluorescent lesions were divided in two groups: perilesional atrophy, corresponding to area around the mCNV, and patchy extralesional atrophy, corresponding to CRA between the temporal vascular arcades. RESULTS. Thirty-six eyes of 18 patients were included. The mean perilesional CRA size significantly increased from baseline to 12 months (3.5 +/- 10.6 mm2, P = 0.02) and 24 months (4.4 +/- 11.7 mm2, P = 0.038) in the treated eye. In treated and not treated eyes, patchy extralesional CRA at the posterior pole increased significantly from baseline to 12 and 24 months follow-up. None of the fellow eyes developed mCNV. No significant relationship was found between the number of injections, AxL, age, and perilesional and patchy extralesional CRA in the treated and not treated eyes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. In eyes with pathologic myopia and mCNV, intravitreal injections of ranibizumab should not be considered as a contributing risk factor worsening the natural course of CRA, even though the risk of the perilesional CRA enlargement should be taken into account.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Purpose: Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) was used to evaluate retinal and vitreo-retinal changes that occur in highly myopic patients. Method(s): This prospective study included 472 eyes of 472 patients suffering from high myopia (> -6.00 D), between May 2012 and December 2015. All patients were examined, using Cirrus HD OCT (Zeiss Cirrus TM HD-OCT model 4000), to detect any retinal or vitreoretinal interface abnormalities. All obtained data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and the paired two-sided t-test. Bivariate correlations were performed between different parameters using the Spearman correlation coefficient (r). Result(s): Mean spherical equivalent (MSE) was -13.11+/- 4.35D. Mean axial length (AL) was 28.5+/-1.62 mm. Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) was the most frequent OCT finding; representing 33.4% of the cases, 13.7% of them were associated with macular traction. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between AL and MTM, full thickness macular hole, PVD with traction, and dome shaped macula (r = 0.49 and P = 0.001, r = 0.422 and P = 0.0001, r = 0.25 and P = 0.03, r=0.475, P=0.001 respectively) Conclusion(s): OCT is a valuable tool in detecting retinal and vitreo-retinal interface abnormalities in highly myopic eyes, and it can be used for follow up of those patients to avoid advanced retinal damage.Copyright © 2017 AttaAllah et al.

N2  - Purpose: To identify the prognostic variables relative to myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treated with intravitreal ranibizumab/bevacizumab. Method(s): Forty-eight patients with myopic CNV were enrolled in a prospective, interventional, non-randomized 12-month study. Intravitreal ranibizumab/bevacizumab was administered in a pro-re-nata regimen and re-treatment was performed in the presence of angiographic leakage, intraretinal/subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography, new hemorrhages, five-letter decrease and increased metamorphosia. The primary outcome measures were the identification of the predictive value of symptom duration, patient's age, refractive error, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), CNV area, CNV location, retinal hemorrhages, atrophy, lacquer cracks, and CNV-fundus autofluorescence pattern (hyper-fundus autofluorescence/patchy pattern). The secondary outcomes were patients requiring either one or two injections to achieve CNV stabilization. Result(s): The mean BCVA improved from 0.49 +/- 0.30 (logarithm of minimal angle resolution, Snellen equivalent 20/63) to 0.39 +/- 0.32 (20/49) at 1-year follow-up (P = 0.043). Univariate and multiple stepwise linear regression analysis identified baseline BCVA (P = 0.0003), symptom duration (P = 0.005), CMT (P = 0.02), and fundus autofluorescence pattern (P = 0.005) as the explanatory variables on the final BCVA and the change in the mean BCVA. Overall, patients with better baseline BCVA, early diagnosis, lower CMT, or disclosing a hyperfundus autofluorescence CNV pattern achieved better visual outcomes. Patients responding with just one to two intravitreal injections (45.8%) obtained better visual outcomes compared with patients receiving three or more injections, and this group consisted of younger patients with lesser CMT, smaller CNV area, and fewer baseline hemorrhages. Conclusion(s): Ranibizumab/bevacizumab therapy was effective in improving and maintaining visual acuity in myopic choroidal neovascularization. Early diagnosis, better baseline BCVA, and hyperfundus autofluorescence CNV pattern were strongly associated with better functional outcomes. Moreover, CNV distinguished by its small size and low CMT responded more favorably, achieving a better visual outcome.© Copyright 2017 Ophthalmic Communication Soceity, Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and choroidal and retinal thickness values between high myopes without myopic maculopathy and emmetropes. Material(s) and Method(s): Case control study where 53 myopes with axial length (AL) above 26 mm without myopic maculopathy and 53 age-matched emmetropes with AL between 21.50 and 24.50 were included as controls. Complete ophthalmological examination and biometry were performed. Choroidal and individual retinal layer thickness maps using spectral domain optical coherence tomography were obtained in the macular and peripapillary area with enhanced depth imaging. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness was obtained using the circular 12degreediameter scan. Result(s): Mean age was 31.9 +/- 9.9 and 32.5 +/- 9.3 years in the myopes and controls, respectively (p > 0.05). Mean BCVA was 55.32 +/- 2.50 versus 57.04 +/- 2.27 ETDRS letters, in the myopes and controls, respectively (p = 0.0004). AL was the principal predictive factor for macular and peripapillary CT in myopes and macular CT in controls. BCVA was not influenced by choroidal thickness (CT). BCVA positively correlated with global pRNFL, following correction for age and AL, in both groups (r = 0.38, p = 0.008 and r = 0.38, p = 0.007 in the myopic and control groups, respectively). Statistical analysis following correction for the potential confounding factors of age, gender, AL, gender, AL, macular CT, and peripapillary CT, showed no significant differences in macular and peripapillary thicknesses between the two groups. Conclusion(s): AL is the principal predictive factor for macular and peripapillary CT in high myopes without maculopathy, and CT is not an independent predictor of visual acuity. Global pRNFL thickness is the only independent predictive factor of BCVA.Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Purpose To expand our understanding of the uncommon entity, referred to as perifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex (PEVAC) by describing multimodal imaging findings, including optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Patients diagnosed with PEVAC were identified at 4 retina referral centers worldwide and underwent complete ophthalmologic examination including structural OCT, OCT-A, fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Demographics and clinical findings were analyzed at baseline and at available follow-ups. Results Fifteen eyes (15 patients, mean age 73 +/- 13 years) were included. Six of 15 eyes were diagnosed with coincident age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 2 with myopic macular degeneration. On fundus examination PEVAC presented as a large perifoveal isolated aneurysm, unifocal in 12 of 15 eyes, associated with small retinal hemorrhages and intraretinal exudation. On structural OCT, PEVAC appeared as a round hyperreflective lesion with hyporeflective lumen, typically surrounded by intraretinal cystic spaces. Dye angiography demonstrated a well-defined hyperfluorescent lesion with variable leakage on FA and without leakage on ICGA. OCT-A showed flow signal correlating with the aneurysmal lesion connecting to retinal capillary plexuses. Seven patients were followed for 13.0 +/- 10.5 months with no evidence of functional/anatomic changes. Three patients underwent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) intravitreal injections without improvement. Two eyes were associated with a type 3 neovascularization eccentric to PEVAC. Conclusions PEVAC is an isolated, perifoveal, aneurysmal abnormality, occurring in otherwise healthy patients who may manifest other macular disease including AMD and myopic macular degeneration. PEVAC did not typically respond to anti-VEGF therapy, and may be associated with type 3 neovascularization.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: The repeatability and reproducibility of quantitative metrics from optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) must be assessed before these data can be confidently interpreted in clinical research and practice. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of OCTA-derived retinal vascular quantitative metrics. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, 21 healthy volunteers (42 eyes) and 22 patients with retinal disease (22 eyes), including 14 with age-related macular degeneration, 3 with epiretinal membrane, 2 with diabetic retinopathy, 2 with myopic macular degeneration, and 1 with retinal vein occlusion, were enrolled. Participants were recruited from September 1 through November 31, 2016. Each eye underwent 3 repeated scans with 3 instruments for a total of 9 acquisitions. Eyes were randomly assigned to scanning with a 3 x 3-mm or 6 x 6-mm pattern. Eyes were excluded from subsequent analysis if any acquisition had a signal strength of less than 7. Repeatability (defined as the agreement in measurements within a device) and reproducibility (defined as the agreement between devices of the same type) were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation. EXPOSURES: All eyes underwent scanning using 3 separate devices. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Vessel length density (VLD) and perfusion density (PD) of the superficial retinal vasculature. RESULT(S): A total of 21 healthy volunteers (8 men and 13 women; mean [SD] age, 36 [6] years) and 22 patients with retinal disease (15 men and 7 women; mean [SD] age, 79 [9] years) underwent evaluation. Of these, 40 of 42 normal eyes and 15 of 22 eyes with retinal disease met signal strength criteria and were included in this analysis. The ICC among the 3 consecutive scans ranged from 0.82 to 0.98 for VLD and from 0.83 to 0.95 for PD. The coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 2.2% to 5.9% for VLD and from 2.4% to 5.9% for PD. For reproducibility, the ICC ranged from 0.62 to 0.95 and the CV was less than 6% in all groups. The agreement was highest for the 3 x 3-mm pattern in the inner ring (ICC range, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.96] to 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.98]) and 6 x 6-mm pattern in the outer ring (ICC range, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86-0.97] to 0.96 [95% CI, 0.92-0.98]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vessel length density and PD of the superficial retinal vasculature can be obtained from OCTA images with high levels of repeatability and reproducibility but can vary with scan pattern and location.Copyright © 2017 American Medical Association.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of myopic retinopathy (MR) in rural Central India. Method(s): The population-based Central India Eye and Medical Study included 4711 subjects (aged 30+ years). The participants underwent a detailed eye examination, including fundus photography. Myopic retinopathy was defined according to the Pathologic Myopia Study Group. Result(s): Readable fundus photographs were available on 4561 (96.8%) subjects (8846 eyes). Myopic retinopathy was present in 15 (0.17 +/- 0.04%; 95% confidence interval (CI):0.08%, 0.26%) eyes of 11 (0.24 +/- 0.07%; 95%CI: 0.01, 0.04) individuals. Myopic retinopathy occurred only in eyes with an axial length of >26 mm. Eyes with MR had significantly larger optic discs than eyes without MR (3.69 +/- 1.22 mm2 versus 2.52 +/- 0.77 mm2; p < 0.001). In binary regression analysis, higher prevalence of MR was associated with longer axial length (p < 0.001; odds ratio (OR): 19.6; 95%CI: 4.6, 82.9), higher prevalence of open-angle glaucoma (p = 0.02; OR: 16.1; 95%CI: 1.51, 170), lower best-corrected visual acuity (expressed in logMAR) (=0.03; OR: 0.06; 95%CI: 0.004, 0.75) and female gender (p = 0.002). If level of education was added to the model, educational level was not significantly associated with MR (p = 0.17; OR: 0.53; 95%CI: 0.22, 1.31). If gender was dropped from the model, higher prevalence of MR was associated with lower educational level (p = 0.04; OR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.20, 0.97). Conclusion(s): Prevalence of MR in rural Central India was low (11/4561 or 0.2%), and correlated with a 16 times higher risk of open-angle glaucoma, after adjusting for axial length and gender. If gender was excluded from the analysis, higher prevalence of MR was associated with lower educational level. This latter finding distinguishes adult MR from today's school children myopia which is strongly associated with higher educational level.Copyright © 2016 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - Purpose: To examine an association between macular Bruch's membrane defects (MBMD) and a dome-shaped appearance of the macula (DSM). Design(s): Retrospective, observational case series study. Method(s): The study included highly myopic individuals who were consecutively examined between May 2014 and December 2015. The patients underwent swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) for visualization of DSM and MBMDs defined as Bruch's membrane defects located at a distance of maximal 1500 mum from the foveola. Result(s): Out of 1983 highly myopic eyes (1057 patients), 166 eyes (8.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI):7.2%,9.6%)) showed a DSM and 534 eyes showed a MBMD. In multivariate binary regression analysis, higher prevalence of DSM was associated with a higher prevalence of a MBMD (P<0.001; OR: 1.96; 95%CI: 1.40, 2.75) after adjusting for longer axial length (P<0.001; odds ratio (OR): 1.27; 95%CI: 1.16, 1.38). In eyes with a DSM partially surrounded by a MBMD, the retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid appeared relatively unchanged in the central region with Bruch's membrane (BM) preserved. In the ringlike BM-free region surrounding the central prominent island of the DSM, the RPE, the outer and middle retinal layers, the choriocapillaris and the middle-sized choroidal vessel layer were absent. In association with a DSM, three MBMD types were differentiated: MBMDs in patchy chorioretinal atrophy, MBMDs in choroidal neovascularization-related macular atrophy, and MBMDs as temporally extending large parapapillary gamma zone. Conclusion(s): Presence of a DSM was significantly associated with the presence of MBMDs. The morphology of the DSM in association with MBMDs may be associated with a focal relaxation of the posterior sclera, no longer pushed outward by an expanding BM but allowed to partially bulge inward, leading to the formation of a DSM.Copyright © 2017 Fang et al.

N2  - PURPOSE. Pathologic myopia described as myopia accompanied by severe deformation of the eye besides excessive elongation of eye, is usually a genetic heterogeneous disorder characterized by extreme, familial, early-onset vision loss. However, the exact pathogenesis of pathologic myopia remains unclear. In this study, we screened a Han Chinese family with pathologic myopia to identify the causative mutation and explore the possible pathogenic mechanism based on evaluation of the biological functions of the mutation. METHODS. We identified the mutations in a family with pathologic myopia by single nucleotide polymorphism array combined with short tandem repeat microsatellite marker analysis and exome sequencing. Mutations were validated among family members by direct Sanger sequencing. The subcellular localization of the protein variant was investigated by immunofluorescence, and the stability of the mutant protein was determined by immunoblotting. Intracellular levels of adenosine triphosphate and reactive oxygen species and complex I activity were measured by traditional biochemical methods to determine the functional role of the disease-associated mutation. RESULTS. The novel missense mutation: c.798C>G (p.Asp266Glu) in NDUFAF7, cosegregated with the disease and the resulting amino acid substitution affected a highly conserved residue in its protein. The mutation D266E in NDUFAF7 impaired complex I activity, which resulted in decreased ATP levels in cultured cells. CONCLUSIONS. We propose that the heterozygous mutation (c.798C>G) in NDUFAF7 may contribute to the pathogenesis of pathologic myopia, possibly by interfering with the phototransduction cascade. Mitochondrial dysfunction during eye development may lead to pathologic myopia.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

N2  - Purpose: To compare two different initial dosing regimens of intravitreal ranibizumab used to treat myopic choroidal neovascularization. Method(s): A total of 61 eyes of 56 patients were treated: 26 eyes received a single injection followed by treatment pro re nata (1+ PRN), while 35 eyes first received 3 consecutive monthly injections (3+ PRN). Result(s): The mean follow-up was 53 +/- 16 months. The visual acuities were 51.9 +/- 16.2 letters with 3+ PRN and 53 +/- 22.4 letters with 1+ PRN at baseline (p = 0.824); 69.5 +/- 12.3 and 69 +/- 15.1 letters, respectively, at 12 months; and 67.1 +/- 16.2 and 66.4 +/- 19.7 letters, respectively, at the end of follow-up (p = 0.877). Mean survival until first retreatment after the loading dose was 36.9 +/- 6.1 months with 3+ PRN and 19.2 +/- 5.4 months with 1+ PRN (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Both dosing regimens led to similar visual outcomes. For eyes given a single injection in the first quarter, retreatment was needed appreciably earlier. c S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Topic The aim of this article is to review and compile available information on the classification, pathophysiology, and clinical features of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV); to describe the latest data on the management of this disease; and to present guidance. Clinical Relevance In the United States, myopia affects approximately 34 million people (2010), and similar figures have been reported in Europe. Pathologic myopia (PM), a possible consequence of myopia, is estimated to affect up to 3% of the global population. One of the most serious complications of PM is myopic CNV, which often leads to a sudden onset but progressive decline in central vision and is associated with a poor prognosis unless treated. Furthermore, 35% of patients with myopic CNV develop bilateral disease in the fellow eye within 8 years. Although intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have had a major impact on the management of patients with myopic CNV, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of this condition and how to best administer treatment. Additionally, the long-term safety and efficacy of these treatments are largely unknown. Methods We carried out a literature review (September 2015) of all English-language articles in PubMed resulting from searches of the following terms: "choroidal neovascularization" AND "myopia" OR "myopic macular degeneration" OR "degenerative myopia" OR "myopic maculopathy" OR "myopic retinopathy" OR "pathological myopia" OR "pathologic myopia." Results We screened a total of 566 abstracts, and 250 articles were deemed relevant for full publication review. We excluded a further 71, but an additional 44 articles were identified. This resulted in 223 articles being used to develop this review. Conclusions Highly myopic patients experiencing a sudden loss of central vision should be referred for further examination. Once a diagnosis of myopic CNV has been confirmed, after fluorescein angiography, treatment initiation should be prompt and anti-VEGF agents considered as first-line therapy, unless contraindicated. Continued monitoring of patients is required to assess any progression or recurrence of the condition.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology

N2  - Purpose: Atropine is the most effective treatment for myopia at short term. Rebound growth however, is a threat to the long-term benefit. This study explores the three year efficacy of atropine 0.5% treatment for progressive high myopia in a clinical setting, and the risk factors for poor response. Method(s): We performed an effectiveness study of atropine eye drops for progressive myopia in a single university clinic in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Since 2011,218 children have been treated with atropine 0.5% daily for their progressive myopia. For the current analysis, we included children who had 3 year consecutive data using atropine eye drops 0.5% daily (N=58). A standardized eye examination, including cycloplegic refraction and axial length at baseline was performed with follow up examinations every 6 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the contribution of clinical factors associated with progression of myopia during atropine treatment. Result(s): At baseline, children were 9.7 (SD 3.3) years old with median spherical equivalent (SE) of -5.88D (IQR 3.94) and axial length (AL) 25.31 mm (IQR 1.17). Half of the children already had high myopia (<=-6.0D), and the mean annual progression before treatment was -1.1D (IQR 0.97); During the first year of treatment, the annual progression was reduced to a median SE of 0.00D (IQR0.88) and AL 0.13mm (IQR 0.29), second year -0.50D (IQR0.69) and AL 0.14mm (IQR 0.28), third year -0.38D (IQR0.75) and AL 0.10mm (IQR 0.24). Risk factor for poor response (OR 3.26, 95% CI, 1.09 to 4.59, P = 0.02) was a younger age at start of therapy after correcting for gender, age of onset, and degree of myopia. Conclusion(s): Overall, over a 3 year period atropine has an inhibiting effect on SE and AL although most treatment effect was seen in the first year. In younger children atropine treatment was less effective and may need to be combined with additional interventions to accomplish a more significant inhibition of progression.

T1  - Prediction of myopic retinopathy (MR) by age and refractive error (RE)

N2  - Purpose: Prediction of the likelihood of MR for any given age/RE combination is challenging because of the shortage of population based studies and, within those, low sample sizes in the age/RE cells. Here, we combine a previous analysis of MR across RE and a large sample of high myopes categorized according to age and myopic maculopathy (MM) to make predictions for risk of MR. Method(s): A relationship for odds ratios (OR) of developing MR by RE was obtained from a previous analysis using 3 population-based (PB) studies from different countries (Brennan, ARVO 2014). Data for the relation between MR and age were drawn from Shih et al (BJO 2006), which provided a table of MM gradings (according to Avila et al Ophthalmol, 1984) versus age for 552 highly myopic (RE <= -6.00D). A best fit sigmoid function relating age to prevalence of MM, defined as M3 or greater, was calculated from this data. The OR for age and RE were then multiplied together to obtain estimates as a function of age and RE. Various assumptions are inherent in the model; in particular, it is assumed that age and RE operate independently on the risk of developing MR, that OR remain constant across ethnicity, geography and classification, and that OR with age for MM also apply to MR. Result(s): The following equation for OR of developing MR according to age and RE resulted: OR = exp ((ln(age/60.45)/0.134) + RE*0.63) A constant k can then be applied to adjust predicted relative risk to match limited data sets. For example, using a value of 1.32E-03 for k allows fitting of the data to one of the 3 PB studies linking MR to RE (see figure-broken line represents extrapolation beyond data). The model predicts the following risk for a set of REs at age 65 (versus estimates from Vongphanit et al, Ophthalmol, 2002): at -2.00D; 0.8% (0.7%): -4.00D; 2.7% (3.0%): -6.00D; 9.0% (11.4%): -8.00D; 25.9% (28.6%): -10.00D; 55.3% (52,4%). Conclusion(s): This model represents an initial attempt to provide risk estimates of developing MR for given age-RE combinations. As standardization of diagnosis takes place and more data are collected, the value of k can be refined and assumptions inherent in the model can be tested.

N2  - Purpose: For diagnosis of myopic choroid neovascularisation (mCNV) in eyes with high myopia fluorescein angiography (FAG) is the current gold standard. Due to the specific anatomy of highly myopic eyes, high-quality images are often difficult to generate, and challenging with time-sensitive recording techniques (FAG). The purpose of this essay was to compare mCNV imaging with FAG with optical coherence angiography (OCT-A) and describe the advantages and disadvantages. Method(s): 14 eyes with mCNV were examined on the same day with FAG and OCT-A. Then the recordings were compared with one another and compared according to the following criteria: quality of imaging, mCNV detectable, mCNV vessels can be demarcated, activity can be assessed (leakage in FAG vs. flow in OCTA, aided by SD-OCT) Results: Of the 14 eyes, 2 could not be used in OCT-A due to poor imaging quality. In these cases, snapshot of leakage were possible during late phase FAG. In 10 eyes, a diffuse CNV complex with leakage was visible in FAG and a corresponding areas with increased flow were visible in 9 eyes with OCT-A. In one case, the CNV complex was very small and could only be determined clearly in late phase FAG thanks to leakage, while in OCT-A we were not able to separate the CNV network from the physiological choroid flow. Demarcated vessels were only visible in one case with FAG versus 6 in OCT-A (see example in annex). Signs of activity were detectable in FAG with all 14 eyes. In OCT-A pathological flow detection was measurable in 11 cases and corresponded to FAG findings. Conclusion(s): OCT-A allows an accurate assessment of mCNV in patients with high myopia, often superior in the presentation of blood vessel networks compared to FAG. Since OCT-A allows a layered presentation of the retinal vessels, in myopic eyes with large atrophy areas, clear imaging without choroid blooming is possible. In 11 out of 14 cases OCT-A allowed a precise diagnosis, with similar relevance for therapy decisions. In the future the detailed vascular demarcation provided by OCT-A might be a precise and fast follow-up parameter for the diagnosis of mCNV. However OCT-A alone does not appear to be a sufficient diagnostic tool in all cases of mCNV and thus should be used in combination with SD-OCT and FAG in challenging cases. Technical advances as well as the unlimited ability to repeat acquisition can partially compensate for these disadvantages.

N2  - Purpose: This German research project is a prospective observational study in Caucasians with pathologic myopia and pre-defined disease patterns. The intention is to assess the natural progression of this disease within three years and to identify potential risk factors for the development of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Method(s): Initially it was planned to enroll 50 patients per risk group, in total 250 subjects in a multicenter approach. The inclusion criteria, five different morphological risk factors in the study eye, were approved by an independent central reading center (CRC). Apart from an axial length of >= 26 mm the pre-defined groups where defined as: (1) subfoveal choroidal thinning < 50 mum, (2) choroidal curvature length > 6300 mum, (3) lacquer cracks, (4) patchy atrophy > 5 mm2 and (5) preexisting mCNV in the fellow eye (German Clinical Trial Register DRKS00007761). Result(s): After 2 years of recruitment, a total of 153 patients (66% females) with a mean age of 57.2 years (+/- 12.7), ranging from 21.9 to 86.2 years, were included. Age distribution was similar for the two groups subfoveal choroidal thinning and lacquer cracks, with a mean age of 57.1 (n=51) and 54.4 years (n=50) respectively. In the patchy atrophy group, data showed a shift in distribution to older patients (mean 63.7 years, n=22). Patients with preexisting mCNV in the fellow eye showed a mean age of 56.4 years (n=22). Furthermore it was shown that the risk factor choroidal curvature (5% of the total population, n= 8) was rarely found in the Caucasian population. Conclusion(s): The HELP study is the first study that prospectively analyses risk factors for the development of mCNV in Caucasians in a large cohort. The data presented here suggest that the increased choroidal curvature, as defined by the protocol and described in the literature, is less frequent in Caucasians than in Asian population and the risk factor patchy atrophy might occur mainly in elderly Caucasian patients.

N2  - Purpose: Myopic foveoschisis (MF) in patients with myopic degeneration was not well appreciated prior to the advent of high resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. Information is still limited on the clinical course of patients with MF. In our study we aim to provide additional data on the clinical outcomes of patients with MF. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of myopic degeneration with posterior staphyloma from a New York City retinal subspecialty practice to identify patients with evidence of MF present on OCT. In cases of MF the demographic data, clinical course, and imaging, including OCT and fluorescein angiography, were evaluated. Result(s): 196 patients with myopic degeneration and posterior staphyloma were identified: 9 eyes of 8 patients had MF on OCT. Age at incidence of MF ranged from 47 to 73 years old. Six were females, 2 were males. Mean follow up from incidence of MF was 47 months. Seven of the 8 patients had unilateral MF during the period of observation; one patient developed bilateral MF. Four of the 9 eyes underwent surgery. Of the 5 that did not receive surgery, 2 were noted to have anatomic improvement on OCT and maintained stable acuity and 3 demonstrated stable OCT findings but with a reduction in visual acuity. Of the 4 patients who underwent surgical intervention, 3 of the 4 had repair of macular hole, and one underwent repair of a subtotal retinal detachment. Time from development of MF to time of macular hole development was 4, 11, and 49 months in the 3 eyes. Two of the 3 eyes with macular holes had stable visual acuity following repair, one of the eyes showed improved visual acuity. The retinal detachment was repaired with anatomic improvement of the foveoschisis. Myopic choroidal neovascularization did not develop in any of the 9 eyes during the period of follow up. Conclusion(s): Our data are consistent with prior studies indicating that the course of MF is highly variable, ranging from nonprogression (3/9), spontaneous resolution (2/9) or macular hole formation (3/9). Surgical outcomes can be favorable.

N2  - Refractive errors are the most common eye disorders worldwide and the largest source of visual impairment. In particular, high myopia is associated with a significant risk of visual complications, such as myopic macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. The absolute risk of severe visual impairment increases significantly with each diopter of myopic refractive error, ranging from 3% to 5% in individuals with errors of -6.00 D to more than 40% in those with -15.00 D or more. Reports have shown that the prevalence of myopia is on the rise worldwide with the highest prevalence in Asia. This figure is dramatic and demand effective counteractions. The lecture will address the main question "Why do eyes become myopic?" from various perspectives including epidemiological data (genetics, environmental factors, etc.) and animal studies.

N2  - Purpose Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) can develop in eyes with pathologic myopia. The study investigates the role of age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of eyes with myopic CNV after treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab injections. Methods Retrospective review of charts of 21 eyes with myopic CNV treated with ranibizumab injections. Diagnosis was confirmed with fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, SD-OCT, refraction and axial length measurement in all cases. Two age subgroups were created, putting the limit to 40 years of age. The correlation of age with the change in visual acuity and the number of injections was evaluated. Results The follow-up period was for at least 30 months. Age of the patients was significantly correlated with the number of injections, as well as with the improvement in the LogMAR corrected distance visual acuity. All patients in the younger aged subgroup were stable or improved in comparison to the initial CDVA, versus 57% of patients in the older aged subgroup (p=0.04, chi square test). In the younger aged subgroup 86% of patients had final CDVA equal to or better than 20/40 and in the older aged subgroup 14% of patients (p=0.001, chi square test). Conclusions Younger than 40 years old patients found to need fewer intravitreal injections and to obtain a more prominent visual improvement. Age seems to be a critical prognostic factor for the outcome in cases of myopic CNV treated with reanibizumab.

N2  - Purpose: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and malignancy are dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for progression. Systemic VEGF production is required and augmented in malignancy. It is possible that this increased systemic production could induce, augment and sustain secondary CNV from any cause and could also lead to poor response to anti-VEGF agents. Method(s): Descriptive study of consecutive patients presenting with CNV and malignancy or patients while on treatment for CNV who developed malignancy between 2012 and 2015, at the Canberra Retina Clinic, Canberra, Australia. CNV was confirmed with standard imaging studies that included fluorescein angiography and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography. The cancer type, stage, treatment and temporal relation to wet CNV presentation were obtained from case record. Refractory response to anti-VEGF agents in patients with CNV was defined as persistence of sub-retinal and intra-retinal fluid on a monthly treatment schedule with the standard dose of these agents. Similar response was recorded with all three commercially available anti-VEGF agents. Result(s): Nine patients with CNV secondary to age related macular degeneration (AMD), myopia and chronic central serous retinopathy (CCSR) were identified. The male-female distribution was 50% in patients with AMD. Active malignancy of any type was associated with a poor response to anti-VEGF agents in this group of patients with CNV secondary to AMD, CCSR and myopia. Treatment and remission from cancer was associated with response to anti-VEGF treatment. Conclusion(s): Active malignancy was associated with poor response to anti-VEGF agents, and therefore may benefit from dose escalation for control.

N2  - Introduction/Background: BRILLIANCE was a 12-month (M), phase III, randomised, double-masked, active-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab 0.5 mg versus verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT) in Asian patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Method(s): Eligible adult patients (N = 457) were randomised into Group 1 (G1, n = 182; ranibizumab on day 1, M1 and thereafter as needed guided by visual acuity [VA] stabilisation); G2 (n = 184; ranibizumab on day 1 and thereafter as needed guided by disease activity); or G3 (n = 91; vPDT on day 1 and treated with ranibizumab or vPDT or both as needed guided by disease activity from M3). The study objectives included superiority assessment of both ranibizumab treatments versus vPDT with respect to mean average best-corrected VA (BCVA) change from baseline to M1-3 (primary), non-inferiority of G2 versus G1 with respect to mean average BCVA change from baseline to M1-6 (secondary), mean BCVA change, treatment exposure and safety over 12M. Result(s): Overall, 431 (94.3%) patients completed the study. At baseline, mean age was 51.2 years, majority were female (68.1%) and mean VA was 53.5 letters. Ranibizumab treatment in G1 and G2 was superior to vPDT (G1: +9.5, G2: +9.8 vs. G3: +4.5 letters; p < 0.001) based on mean average change in BCVA from baseline to M1-3. Ranibizumab in G2 was non-inferior to G1 with respect to mean average change in BCVA from baseline to M1-6 (10.7 vs. 10.4 letters, p < 0.001). The mean BCVA change was 12.0 (G1), 13.1 (G2) and 10.3 (G3) letters with a mean of 4.6 (G1), 3.9 (G2) and 2.6 (G3) ranibizumab injections. No new safety findings were identified. Conclusion(s): Ranibizumab treatment, with re-treatment guided by VA or disease activity, demonstrated superior efficacy in BCVA gain compared to vPDT in Asian patients with myopic CNV up to M3. Overall, ranibizumab was well tolerated.

N2  - Introduction/Background: Factors influencing the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy in patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) are limitedly studied. The purpose was to study ophthalmological and immunological parameters to find predictors of therapeutic response to anti-VEGFs in mCNV. Method(s): 19 patients (15 females, 4 males, mean age +/- SD was 48.52 +/- 15.49 years) (19 eyes) with active mCNV treated with ranibizumab were included to the study. Myopic refraction varied from -3.5 to -15.5 D (mean +/- SD - 9.45 +/- 4.73D). All patients underwent detailed ophthalmological examination during follow-up period (12 months). Immunological study of aqueous humor was performed before and 1 month after ranibizumab initial injection. Cytokines concentrations were measured using flow fluorometry with Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Panel, 27-Plex ("Bio-Rad Laboratories", USA). Result(s): CNV activity was suppressed in 17 patients (89.5%) with approximately 2.6 injections (from 2 to 4); these patients were considered as "good" responders. 2 patients (11.5%) received 7 ranibizumab injections during 12 months of follow-up, and the treatment was continued because of residual activity. The second group demonstrated "poor" response to the therapy characterized by myopic refraction -4.25 and -3.75 D, axial length not exceeding 26.0 mm (24.5 and 25.7 mm), higher baseline subretinal neovascular membrane length (more than 1230 mum) and macular volume (10.4 and 10.9 mm3 compared to 9.37 +/- 1.2 mm3 in "good" responders). These two patients were also characterized by relatively high baseline VEGF level (159.58 and 368.03 pg/ml) and inflammatory cytokine IL-2 level (49.32 and 53.27 pg/ml compared to 25.11 +/- 27.99 pg/ml in "good" responders); the level of PDGF - BB was below sensitivity threshold (<1.8 pg/ml compared to 21.70 +/- 24.89 pg/ml in "good" responders). Conclusion(s): A number of ophthalmological and immunological characteristics that could be considered as possible predictors for the response to anti-VEGF therapy in mCNV were found, which requires further studies.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the duration of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and treatment outcome after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of treatment-naive myopic CNV patients who were treated with anti-VEGF and followed for at least 24 months to identify factors predicting final outcome and recurrence. Result(s): Among 106 eyes, a shorter duration of CNV was a significant predictor of a better final best-corrected visual acuity, even after controlling for other factors (p = 0.042). When divided into 3 groups according to CNV duration before treatment (<2, 2-8, and 8-24 weeks), the recurrence rate (19, 25, and 52%, respectively; p = 0.006) and number of injections (3.5, 4.0, and 5.5, respectively; p = 0.021) were significantly lower in eyes with a shorter duration of CNV. Conclusion(s): Early anti-VEGF treatment of myopic CNV decreased the recurrence rate and number of injections and improved visual outcome.Copyright © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore the role of age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab injections. Method(s): A retrospective review of charts of patients treated with intravitreal injections of ranibizumab for the treatment of myopic CNV was done. Patients with other ophthalmic disease were excluded. Patients were followed for at least 2 years. The correlation between age and the change in visual acuity and the number of injections during treatment was investigated. Result(s): Age of the patients was significantly correlated with the number of injections that the patients received (Pearson's r=0.585, P=0.005). Also, it was significantly correlated with improvement in corrected distance visual acuity, defined as the difference between final and initial LogMAR corrected distance visual acuity (Pearson's r=0.614, P=0.003). Conclusion(s): Age significantly affects the visual outcome of myopic CNV treatment with ranibizumab. Younger patients in our study needed fewer intravitreal injections and achieved a more significant improvement in vision.Copyright © 2017 Karagiannis et al.

N2  - PURPOSE. To evaluate the features of extrafoveal retinoschisis (EFRS) in highly myopic eyes detected by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). METHODS. In this retrospective case series, 89 eyes of 65 patients with high myopia and coexisting EFRS were included. The participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, ocular biometry, refraction, and perimetry. Three-dimensional wide-field scans were obtained with SS-OCT, and en face images were reconstructed with custom software. En face OCT features of EFRS were determined by two ophthalmologists masked to clinical characteristics. The associations of EFRS subtypes with ocular biometry and other OCT changes were evaluated as well. RESULTS. In wide-field SS-OCT scans, EFRS was classified into three different types, the inner limiting membrane (ILM) detachment and inner and outer EFRS, according to the specific layer of the splitting. All these three types were most frequently distributed in the inferotemporal quadrant (71.2% for ILM detachment, 59.5% for inner EFRS, and 75.0% for outer EFRS). Inner limiting membrane detachment and inner EFRS were often adjacent to peripapillary atrophy. Outer EFRS tends to coexist with inner EFRS, as we did not observe any case with standalone outer EFRS or with coexisting with ILM detachment. Eyes with all three types combined had the longest axial length (29.1 6 1.26 mm, P = 0.003) and the greatest refractive error (13.0 6 2.86 diopters [D], P = 0.014). The incidence of retinal microfolds and breaks among subgroups was significantly different (P = 0.012 and 0.003, respectively). Staphyloma was associated with outer EFRS (30.6% with versus 7.6% without outer EFRS). CONCLUSIONS. Wide-field SS-OCT reveals the spatial distribution of retinoschisis outside the fovea, and associations with retinal vessels and other retinal landmark structures. Further observations on the longitudinal changes and functional damage would help lead to a better understanding of its mechanism and prognosis.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

N2  - Background/aims To describe the morphological features of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) and to report the ability of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) to detect the presence of myopic CNV by means of this new technique. Methods Myopic CNV cases were individuated from a pool of patients with pathological myopia consecutively presenting between October 2015 and March 2016. OCT-A images were assessed for classification of morphological features, and to estimate sensitivity and specificity. Results Thirty-six eyes of 28 consecutive patients with myopic CNV were included. In 4 out of 36 eyes it was not possible to classify the CNV 'core', 'appearance' because the vascular network was not clearly visualised due to the poor quality of the examination. CNV shape on OCT-A was rated as circular in 9 eyes and irregular in 23 eyes. CNV core was visible in 11 eyes. CNV margin was considered as well defined in 16 eyes and poorly defined in 16 eyes. CNV appearance showed an 'interlacing' aspect in 16 eyes and a 'tangled' aspect in the other 16 eyes. A total of 11 CNVs were defined as active, 9 of which (81.8%) were interlacing, while a total of 21 were inactive, 14 of which (66.7%) were tangled. OCT-A sensitivity turned out to be 90.48% and specificity was 93.75%. Conclusions We describe the OCT-A features of myopic CNV secondary to pathological myopia and demonstrate its high sensitivity and specificity for neovascular detection. Qualitative evaluation of OCT-A characteristics may allow one to recognise different patterns, possibly corresponding to different degrees of neovascular activity.Copyright © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the prevalence and incidence of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in Taiwan, including the health care utilization and treatment-associated costs. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study using existing data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance claims database to identify patients who had a diagnosis of myopic CNV recorded from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011. The prevalence of myopic CNV was monitored during this period, and the frequency and cost of both treatment visits and monitoring visits were analyzed for 2 years following diagnosis. Result(s): The prevalence of myopic CNV was 0.017%. In total, 9068 patients with myopic CNV were identified, 12.3% (n = 1111) of whom were treated. Of those treated, 72.0% (n = 800) received intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections (IVI); the remainder received either photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (vPDT), laser photocoagulation, or a combination of therapies. IVI was associated with the largest number of treatment visits as well as a higher administrative (non-drug) cost per treatment visit (a mean of USD 57.18). vPDT alone was associated with a higher overall cost per treatment visit and more monitoring visits than IVI or laser photocoagulation. Costs for monitoring visits were highest for IVI. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of myopic CNV was lower than that reported in previous studies, possibly because of differences in age distribution in the populations studied. The frequencies of treatment administered were similar to those reported in previous studies; however, a cost-effectiveness comparison could not be made owing to lack of data in previous studies.Copyright © 2017, Japanese Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim is to evaluate the association between high myopia and genetic variant in the BicC family RNA binding protein 1 (BICC1) as well as its association with Ras protein specific guanine nucleotide releasing factor 1 (RASGRF1) genes in a Chinese Han population with a case-control study., METHODS: Five TagSNPs in BICC1 and RASGRF1 genes were selected and genotyped in 821 unrelated subjects, which composed of 419 controls (spherical equivalent within +/-1.00 D in both eyes and axial length 24.0 mm) and 402 cases (spherical equivalent <=-6.0D in at least one eye and axial length >=26.0 mm). Statistical analysis was performed with SNPstats., RESULTS: After an analysis adjusted by age and sex, rs4245599 in BICC1 was found to be significantly associated with high myopia under the codominant, dominant, recessive and log-additive model (P = 0.001, 0.0015, 0.0045 and 2e-04, odds ratio [OR] = 2.15, 1.59, 1.73 and 1.46, respectively), and rs10763559 in BICC1 was associated with high myopia and under the dominant and log-additive model (P = 0.032 and 0.036, OR = 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). Rs4778879 in RASGRF1 was found to be significantly associated with high myopia under codominant, dominant, recessive, and log-additive model (P = 0.0088, 0.0065, 0.026, and 0.0021, OR = 1.87, 1.48, 1.56, and 1.37, respectively). However, no significant association was found between rs745030 in RASGRF1 and high myopia, neither was there any association of rs745029 in RASGRF1., CONCLUSION: The present study indicated that genetic variants in BICC1 and RASGRF1 are closely associated with high myopia, which appears to be a potential candidate for high myopia in Chinese Han population. Considering the small sample size of this study, further work is needed to validate our results. The function of BICC1 and RASGRF1 in the process of developing high myopia needs to be explored in the future.

N2  - Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is one of the most vision-impairing complications in patients with pathologic myopia. It is also one of the most frequently encountered non.age-related macular degeneration causes of CNV and affects young patients in the working age group. Fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) are generally indicated to confirm the diagnosis of active myopic CNV before initiation of treatment. Without treatment, natural history studies have shown that the vision outcome can be very poor. More recently, a number of retrospective, prospective and phase 3, multicenter, randomized controlled trials have established the safety and efficacy of intravitreal anti.vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for the treatment of myopic CNV. Long-term follow-up studies have found that some of the initial vision gained after intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy may not be maintained, owing to the presence and progression of chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) adjacent to the CNV. Further research on clinical and imaging characteristics may elucidate the prognostic factors that are crucial to optimizing the treatment and prevention of visual impairment associated with myopic CNV.Copyright 2017 Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Knobloch syndrome is a rare, recessively inherited disorder classically characterized by highmyopia, retinal detachment, and occipital encephalocele, but it is now known to have an increasingly variable phenotype. There is a lack of reported electrophysiologic data, and some key clinical features have yet to be described. OBJECTIVE To expand on current clinical, electrophysiologic, and molecular genetic findings in Knobloch syndrome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twelve patients from 7 families underwent full ophthalmic examination and retinal imaging. Further investigations included electroretinography and neuroradiologic imaging. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of COL18A1 was performed with segregation on available relatives. The study was conducted from July 4, 2013, to October 5, 2015. Data analysis was performed from May 20, 2014, to November 3, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Results of ophthalmic and neuroradiologic assessment and sequence analysis of COL18A1. RESULTS Of the 12 patients (6 males; mean age at last review, 16 years [range, 2-38 years]), all had highmyopia in at least 1 eye and severely reduced vision. A sibling pair had unilateral high myopia in their right eyes and near emmetropia in their left eyes from infancy. Anterior segment abnormalities included absent iris crypts, iris transillumination, lens subluxation, and cataract. Two patients with iris transillumination had glaucoma. Fundus characteristics included abnormal collapsed vitreous, macular atrophy, and a tesselated fundus. Five patients had previous retinal detachment. Electroretinography revealed a cone-rod pattern of dysfunction in 8 patients, was severely reduced or undetectable in 2 patients, and demonstrated cone-rod dysfunction in 1 eye with undetectable responses in the other eye in 2 patients. Radiologic imaging demonstrated occipital encephalocele or meningocele in 3 patients, occipital skull defects in 4 patients, minor occipital changes in 2 patients, and no abnormalities in 2 patients. Cutaneous scalp changes were present in 5 patients. Systemic associations were identified in 8 patients, including learning difficulties, epilepsy, and congenital renal abnormalities. Biallelic mutations including 2 likely novel mutations in COL18A1, were identified in 6 families that were consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance with a single mutation identified in a family with 2 affected children. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This report describes new features in patients with Knobloch syndrome, including pigment dispersion syndrome and glaucoma as well as cone-rod dysfunction on electroretinography. Two patients had normal neuroradiologic findings, emphasizing that some affected individuals have isolated ocular disease. Awareness of the ocular phenotype may aid early diagnosis, appropriate genetic counseling, and monitoring for potential complications.Copyright 2016 American Medical Association.

N2  - The natural course of high-axial myopia is variable and the development of pathologic myopia is not fully understood. Advancements in optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology have revealed peculiar intraocular structures in highly myopic eyes and unprecedented pathologies that cause visual impairment. New OCT findings include posterior precortical vitreous pocket and precursor stages of posterior vitreous detachment; peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation; morphological patterns of scleral inner curvature and dome-shaped macula. Swept source OCT is capable of imaging deeper layers in the posterior pole for investigation of optic nerve pits, stretched and thinned lamina cribrosa, elongated dural attachment at posterior scleral canal, and enlargement of retrobulbar subarachnoid spaces. This has therefore enabled further evaluation of various visual field defects in high myopia and the pathogenesis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. OCT has many potential clinical uses in managing visual impairing conditions in pathologic myopia. Understanding how retinal nerve fibers are redistributed in axial elongation will allow the development of auto-segmentation software for diagnosis and monitoring progression of glaucoma. OCT is indispensable in the diagnosis of various conditions associated with myopic traction maculopathy and monitoring of post-surgical outcomes. In addition, OCT is commonly used in the multimodal imaging assessment of myopic choroidal neovascularization. Biometry and topography of the retinal layers and choroid will soon be validated for the classification of myopic maculopathy for utilization in epidemiological studies as well as clinical trials.Copyright © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of myopic maculopathy and specific optic disc and macular changes in highly myopic eyes of young Asian adults and their impact on visual acuity. Design(s): Prospective cross-sectional study. Method(s): In total, 593 highly myopic (spherical equivalent refraction [SER] less than -6.00 diopters [D]) and 156 emmetropic (SER between -1.00 and +1.00 D) male participants from a population-based survey were included. All participants underwent standardized medical interviews, ophthalmic examination, and color fundus photographs. These photographs were graded systematically to determine the presence of optic disc and macular lesions. Myopic maculopathy was classified based on the International Classification of Myopic Maculopathy. Result(s): The mean age was 21.1 +/- 1.2 years. The mean SER for the highly myopic and emmetropic group was -8.87 +/- 2.11 D and 0.40 +/- 0.39 D, respectively (P <.001). Compared to emmetropic eyes, highly myopic eyes were significantly more likely to have optic disc tilt, peripapillary atrophy (PPA), posterior staphyloma, chorioretinal atrophy, and myopic maculopathy (all P <.001). The main findings included PPA (98.3%), disc tilt (22.0%), posterior staphyloma (32.0%), and chorioretinal atrophy (8.3%). Myopic maculopathy was present in 8.3% of highly myopic eyes and was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.66; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.26), reduced choroidal thickness (OR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.99), and increased axial length (AL) (OR 1.52; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.19). The presence of disc tilt, posterior staphyloma, and chorioretinal atrophy were associated with reduced visual acuity. Conclusion(s): Our study showed that myopia-related changes of the optic disc and macula were common in highly myopic eyes even at a young age. The risk factors for myopic maculopathy include increased age, longer AL, and reduced choroidal thickness. Some of these changes were associated with reduced central visual function.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Previous studies have identified many genetic loci for refractive error and myopia. We aimed to investigate the effect of these loci on ocular biometry as a function of age in children, adolescents, and adults. The study population consisted of three age groups identified from the international CREAM consortium: 5,490 individuals aged <10 years; 5,000 aged 10-25 years; and 16,274 aged >25 years. All participants had undergone standard ophthalmic examination including measurements of axial length (AL) and corneal radius (CR). We examined the lead SNP at all 39 currently known genetic loci for refractive error identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as a combined genetic risk score (GRS). The beta coefficient for association between SNP genotype or GRS versus AL/CR was compared across the three age groups, adjusting for age, sex, and principal components. Analyses were Bonferroni-corrected. In the age group <10 years, three loci (GJD2, CHRNG, ZIC2) were associated with AL/CR. In the age group 10-25 years, four loci (BMP2, KCNQ5, A2BP1, CACNA1D) were associated; and in adults 20 loci were associated. Association with GRS increased with age; beta = 0.0016 per risk allele (P = 2 x 10-8) in <10 years, 0.0033 (P = 5 x 10-15) in 10- to 25-year-olds, and 0.0048 (P = 1 x 10-72) in adults. Genes with strongest effects (LAMA2, GJD2) had an early effect that increased with age. Our results provide insights on the age span during which myopia genes exert their effect. These insights form the basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying high and pathological myopia.Copyright © 2016 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the influence of choroidal thickness (CT) on visual acuity (VA) in young persons with extremely high myopia. Method(s): We conducted a case-control study of young men with extremely high myopia and controls with emmetropia recruited from a mandatory medical eye review for employment purposes. Retinal and choroidal imaging was performed using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Result(s): We included 105 extremely high myopic subjects with spherical equivalent (SE) -10 dioptre (D) or worse and 50 emmetropic subjects with SE less than 0.5 D. The mean SE was -11.56 +/- 2.04 D (range, -10 to -23 D) for myopic group and 0.14 +/- 0.25 D for emmetropic group. The mean age of included myopic and emmetropic subjects was 21.51 +/- 1.22 years and 21.96 +/- 0.89 years, respectively. In the univariate analysis, subfoveal CT was significantly associated with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (beta = -0.039, p = 0.015). However, in the multiple linear regression analysis, after adjusting for SE and presence of any pathological myopia lesions such as posterior staphyloma, lacquer cracks or chorioretinal atrophy, subfoveal CT was not independently associated with BCVA (p = 0.937). Conclusion(s): Extremely high myopic eyes had thinner choroid, but CT was not an independent predictor of VA. Other factors related to myopia are likely responsible for the diminished VA in young extremely high myopic eyes.Copyright © 2016 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - Aims: To evaluate the characteristics of the posterior segments of eyes with high myopia and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) and identify which ocular factors are most associated with scleral thickness and posterior staphyloma height. Method(s): The study included 45 patients with highly myopic NTG and 38 controls with highly myopic eyes (<=-6D or axial length >=26.0 mm). The subfoveal retinal, choroidal, scleral thickness and the posterior staphyloma heights were examined from enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and compared between two groups. Result(s): Highly myopic NTG eyes had thinner subfoveal scleral thickness (473.03+/-43.75 vs 579.46+/-75.87 mum, p<0.001) and higher posterior staphyloma (97.80+/-70.10 vs 62.83+/-32.01 mum, p=0.027) than highly myopic, non-glaucomatous eyes. Subfoveal scleral thickness was significantly correlated with age, axial length, corneal hysteresis and the posterior staphyloma height of the superior quadrant, the nasal quadrant and the arithmetic mean of four quadrants in highly myopic NTG eyes. Corneal hysteresis (beta=2.694, p=0.015), corneal resistance factor (beta=-2.916, p=0.010) and the posterior staphyloma height of the nasal quadrant (beta=-0.463, p=0.017) were significantly associated with the subfoveal scleral thickness in highly myopic NTG eyes. Conclusion(s): Subfoveal scleral thinning and non-uniform posterior staphyloma were closely related in highly myopic NTG eyes. Corneal hysteresis, corneal resistance factor and the nasal posterior staphyloma height were associated with the scleral thickness.Copyright © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - Aim To compare treatment outcomes for myopic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) managed with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT), intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF, bevacizumab/ranibizumab) agents or combination thereof. Methods Clinical data of 79 eyes with myopic CNV examined from March 2004 to July 2013 was retrospectively reviewed. Patients were managed with vPDT, intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 mL)/ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 mL) or a combination of vPDT and anti-VEGF. Outcome measures included complete regression (scarring) of CNV and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Results Treatments provided were vPDT (n=23), anti-VEGF (n=25) (ranibizumab, n=12; bevacizumab, n=13), vPDT+anti-VEGF (n=31). Mean logMAR BCVA changed from 0.59+/-0.44 to 0.49+/-0.40 at mean follow-up of 54.63+/-39.46 months. Mean logMAR vision changed from 0.68+/-0.57, 0.54+/-0.48 and 0.59+/-0.39 at presentation to 0.59+/-0.53, 0.38+/-0.44 and 0.37+/-0.37 at last follow-up in PDT (p=0.4), anti-VEGF (p=0.1) and vPDT+anti-VEGF groups (p=0.0002), respectively. CNV was scarred in 64 eyes (81%) at mean 11.03+/-13.56 months. Most common complication was macular scar (n=64), associated with reduced (n=17) or preserved (n=47) vision. Chorioretinal atrophy attributable to vPDT was seen in five eyes (vPDT, n=3; vPDT+anti-VEGF, n=2). Conclusion Combination of vPDT and intravitreal anti-VEGF (ranibizumab/bevacizumab) was associated with better visual outcomes and higher rates of regression in eyes with myopic CNV as compared with monotherapy with PDT or anti-VEGF. Larger size of CNV, and high refractive error were independent risk factors for poor visual outcomes.Copyright © 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - Purpose The range of subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM) seen in macular disease includes type 2 macular neovascularization, fibrosis, exudation, vitelliform material, and hemorrhage. The prognostic significance of SHRM has been evaluated retrospectively in clinical trials, but discriminating SHRM subtypes traditionally requires multiple imaging modalities. The purpose of this study is to describe optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) flow characteristics and artifacts that might help to distinguish SHRM subtypes. Design Validity analysis. Methods Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), myopia, pachychoroid disease, and macular dystrophy, manifesting SHRM on optical coherence tomography (OCT), were recruited. Clinical chart review and multimodal imaging established the SHRM subtype. All patients underwent OCTA. OCT and OCTA images were examined together for (1) intrinsic flow, (2) retinal projection onto the anterior SHRM surface (strong, weak, absent), (3) retinal projection through SHRM onto retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and (4) masking of choriocapillaris flow. Results Thirty-three eyes of 25 patients were included (type 2 neovascularization x3; fibrosis x4; exudation x10; hemorrhage x5; vitelliform x17). Mean age per eye was 76 years (standard deviation: 12). Intrinsic flow was strongest in type 2 neovascularization. Subretinal fibrosis showed limited flow in residual large-caliber vessels and branches. Flow was not detected within foci of exudation, hemorrhage, or vitelliform lesions. Retina-SHRM surface projection was strongest onto smooth-surfaced SHRM and weaker onto exudation. Retinal projection was weakest on the surface of vitelliform lesions. Retina-RPE projection was masked by dense hemorrhage and vitelliform material. In compound SHRM, OCTA distinguished between vascular and avascular components. Conclusion Optical coherence tomography angiography can distinguish vascular from avascular SHRM components. OCTA artifacts may distinguish certain avascular SHRM components.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the incidence and risk factors of subretinal fibrosis and their impact on visual outcome in eyes with myopic CNV. Method(s): Medical records of 72 eyes treated with antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy in a pro re nata regimen for myopic CNV that followed up for more than 1 year were retrospectively reviewed. The presence of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy was determined using both fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography. The incidence and risk factors of subretinal fibrosis were evaluated, and best-corrected visual acuity was compared between the eyes with and without subretinal fibrosis. Result(s): The incidences of subretinal fibrosis during the 1-year and whole follow-up period were 31.9% and 36.1%, respectively. Occurrence of subretinal fibrosis was associated with frequent CNV recurrence (P 0.005) and poor baseline best-corrected visual acuity (P 0.044) in a Cox proportional hazard model. Anatomically, the eyes with subretinal fibrosis showed more frequent progression of chorioretinal atrophy (95.7% vs. 71.4%, P 0.027) and less frequent photoreceptor recovery (17.4% vs. 65.3%, P < 0.001) after anti-VEGF therapy. Occurrence of subretinal fibrosis was associated with poor vision at baseline (P 0.011) and the final visit (P 0.008) when compared with the findings in the nonoccurrence group. Conclusion(s): Development of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy was common in eyes with myopic CNV and was associated with CNV recurrence. Myopic eyes with subretinal fibrosis show progressive chorioretinal atrophy and poor visual outcome.Copyright © by Ophthalmic Communications, Society, Inc.

N2  - Introduction: The global prevalence of pathologic myopia is 0.9-3.1%, and visual impairment is found in 0.1-0.5% of European and 0.2-1.4% of Asian studies. Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) affects 5.2-11.3% of pathologic myopia patients and is a leading cause of vision impairment in the working-age population. Characteristic morphological changes and visual-acuity decrease are diagnostic features. Vascular-Endothelial-Growth-Factor (VEGF) has been identified as a trigger for pathologic neovascularization in these highly myopic patients.Areas Covered: We cover the epidemiology, pathology and diagnostic aspects of mCNV. The history of therapeutic interventions is described, followed by an overview of current standard-of-care (SOC)-blocking VEGF using bevacizumab (off-label), ranibizumab or aflibercept and improving vision up to 13.5-14.4 letters. Despite good efficacy, an unmet medical need remains. We summarize ongoing and future developments of new drugs to treat or potentially cure mCNV.Expert Opinion: mCNV is a major global health concern. Early detection and treatment is key for a satisfying outcome. The current SOC, VEGF inhibitors, affords good therapeutic efficacy and reasonable disease stabilization with few intravitreal treatments per year. However, the long-term prognosis is still unsatisfactory, and side-effects like chorioretinal atrophy development are of concern. Therefore, efforts should be intensified to develop more effective therapies.Copyright © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Complications from pathologic myopia are a major cause of visual impairment and blindness, especially in east Asia. The eyes with pathologic myopia may develop loss of the best-corrected vision due to various pathologies in the macula, peripheral retina and the optic nerve.Despite its importance, the definition of pathologic myopia has been inconsistent. The refractive error or axial length alone often does not adequately reflect the 'pathologic myopia'. Posterior staphyloma, which is a hallmark lesion of pathologic myopia, can occur also in non-highly myopic eyes. Recently a revised classification system for myopic maculopathy has been proposed to standardize the definition among epidemiological studies. In this META-PM (meta analyses of pathologic myopia) study classification, pathologic myopia was defined as the eyes having chorioretinal atrophy equal to or more severe than diffuse atrophy.In addition, the advent of new imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and three dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI) has enabled the detailed observation of various pathologies specific to pathologic myopia. New therapeutic approaches including intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents and the advance of vitreoretinal surgeries have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with pathologic myopia. The purpose of this review article is to provide an update on topics related to the field of pathologic myopia, and to outline the remaining issues which need to be solved in the future.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) is the second most common form of CNV after age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It is a sight-threatening complication of pathologic myopia (PM) and often affects patients in their working years causing significant impact on quality of life. Previous therapies such as photodynamic therapy with verteporfin have shown limited success. Due to the similarities in pathogenesis of mCNV and AMD CNV, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (anti-VEGF), which has so far been the mainstay of treatment for AMD CNV, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of mCNV and has become the first-line treatment of choice. This article aims to examine briefly the epidemiology and pathophysiology of mCNV, as well as review the evidence for efficacy, safety, and clinical use of anti-VEGF treatment for mCNV.Copyright © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the role of SCO2 in extreme myopia of Japanese patients. Method(s): In total, 101 Japanese patients with extreme myopia (axial length of >=30 mm) OU at the Kyoto University Hospital were included in this study. Exon 2 of SCO2 was sequenced by conventional Sanger sequencing. The detected variants were assessed using in silico prediction programs: SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and MutationTaster. To determine the frequency of the mutations in normal subjects, we referred to the 1000 Genomes Project data and the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD) in the Human Genetic Variation Browser. Result(s): The average age of the participants was 62.9 +/- 12.7 years. There were 31 males (30.7 %) and 70 females. Axial lengths were 31.76 +/- 1.17 mm OD and 31.40 +/- 1.07 mm OS, and 176 eyes (87.6 %) out of 201 eyes had myopic maculopathy of grade 2 or more. Among the 101 extremely myopic patients, one mutation (c.290 C > T;p.Ala97Val) in SCO2 was detected. This mutation was not found in the 1000 Genomes Project data or HGVD data. Variant type of the mutation was nonsynonymous. Although the SIFT prediction score was 0.350, the PolyPhen-2 probability was 0.846, thus predicting its pathogenicity to be possibly damaging. MutationTaster PhyloP was 1.268, suggesting that the mutation is conserved. Conclusion(s): We identified one novel possibility of an extreme myopia-causing mutation in SCO2. No other disease-causing mutation was found in 101 extremely myopic Japanese patients, suggesting that SCO2 plays a limited role in Japanese extreme myopia. Further investigation is required for better understanding of extreme myopia.Copyright © 2016, Japanese Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - Purpose: To describe the morphologic alterations on spectral domain optical coherence tomography in active myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) receiving intravitreal bevacizumab and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy, taking fluorescein angiography as a reference examination. Method(s): Thirty patients (30 eyes) were prospectively enrolled. Each eye was imaged with fluorescein angiography and spectral domain optical coherence tomography at the baseline and at 1-, 2-, and 3-month examinations. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography parameters consisting of intraretinal/subretinal fluid and absence of external limiting membrane (ELM) visibility were considered signs of CNV activity and collated with the presence/absence of leakage on fluorescein angiography. Main outcome measures were frequencies of the retinal alterations associated with myopic CNV at the diagnosis and during monitoring of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. Result(s): At the diagnosis, spectral domain optical coherence tomography identified subretinal fluid in 14 eyes (46%), intraretinal fluid associated with subretinal fluid in 12 eyes (40%), and absence of ELM visibility in 30 of the 30 eyes (100%). During the follow-up, fluorescein leakage was noted in 32 visits (18, 8, and 6 eyes at the 1-, 2- and 3-month examinations, respectively). Taking into consideration spectral domain optical coherence tomography features of active myopic CNVs on fluorescein angiography, subretinal fluid was identified in 24 examinations (75%), intraretinal cysts with subretinal fluid were noted in 5 visits (15.6%), and the absence of ELM visibility was visible in 32 examinations (100%). The alterations of the ELM corresponded to the location of the fluorescein leakage. Conclusion(s): This study provides evidence that the absence of ELM visibility is a more reliable parameter for evaluating CNV activity than intraretinal/subretinal fluid collection and may constitute a useful option in diagnosing and monitoring the myopic CNV during antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

N2  - Background: This article aims to review recent advances in the understanding of epidemiology and risk factors for the development of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and highlight the diagnostic features of myopic CNV and signs seen on the noninvasive optical coherence tomography technology, which may be particularly useful for the purpose of screening. Choroidal neovascularization is a sight-threatening complication of pathologic myopia. Because myopic CNV frequently affects individuals during their working life, its socioeconomic impact is significant, especially in Asian countries where the prevalence of pathologic myopia is high. Epidemiology: Pathological myopia is the most common cause of CNV in patients less than 50 years old, and it is estimated that 5.2% to 11.3% of individuals with pathologic myopia develop myopic CNV. Risk Factors: The risk of developing myopic CNV increases with the severity of myopia and macular changes, such as diffuse atrophy, lacquer cracks, and patchy atrophy, which progress to myopic CNV in a significant proportion. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may contribute to the development of myopic CNV. Natural Course and Prognosis: Untreated myopic CNV carries a poor visual prognosis, with an estimated 89% of the patients having marked visual impairment within 5 years of onset. Treatment: Anti-VEGF therapy is efficacious in treating myopic CNV. Although this significantly improves the short-term prognosis of myopic CNV, the long-term visual loss due to the sequela of myopic CNV including m acular atrophy and scarring remains.Copyright © Contact Lens Association of Opthalmologists, Inc.

N2  - Purpose To evaluate the clinical features of high myopic eyes with cataracts implanted with negative power intraocular lenses (IOLs) at the time of cataract surgery. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted of 18 eyes of 14 patients who underwent cataract surgery with negative power IOLs and 10 eyes in 9 patients with low power IOLs. We investigated axial length, IOL power, preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and preoperative and postoperative spherical equivalent (SE) refractive errors. Results Mean BCVA showed significant improvement in both groups. We measured postoperative SE refraction and the difference between the mean intended and the mean achieved SE refractive errors in the negative power group (17 eyes) was +1.59 +/- 1.34 D and +0.31 +/- 0.50 D in the low power group. Conclusions BCVA was significantly improved in the majority of eyes, although they had myopic macular degeneration or posterior staphyloma. However, the mean achieved postoperative SE refraction was more hyperopic than the predicted postoperative SE error. Additionally, hyperopic refractive error was greater in the negative power group than the low power group. Therefore, we recommend that postoperative hyperopic refractive error should be considered when performing cataract surgery in high myopic patients.

N2  - Introduction: The choroid is believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of several vision threatening diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, inflammatory disorders and myopic macular degeneration. Enhanced depth imaging spectraldomain optical coherence tomography (EDI-SD OCT) has made it possible to visualize the choroid, and it is generally accepted that Heidelberg Spectralis OCT provides valid measurements of choroidal thickness (CT), although no fully automated software is commercially available. Two methods for CT-measurement are available in the Heidelberg software, but to our knowledge these have not been compared. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate and validate the Segmentation method and the Ruler method for CT-measurement. Method(s): We used the Heidelberg Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) to record EDI-SD-OCT and Heidelberg Eye Explorer software (Version 1.9.10.0) to perform measurements. In a 30 degree scan angle, foveal-centered radial scans of 4 sections (with an art mode of 50 frames) were obtained. In accordance with other studies, we made 17 CT measurements per scan at the following targets: Subfoveal, 1 and 3 millimeter in each direction of fovea. Only the horizontal and vertical sections were selected for analysis. A total of 9 targets per eye that represented anatomically different choroidal locations were analysed for every subject. We used 2 different methods from the Heidelberg Explorer software to measure the CT: 1 Segmentation method; by the use of the thickness profile window we manually edited and moved the inner limiting membrane (ILM) line to the choroid-scleral border (CSB), while we kept the automated defined Bruchs membrane (BM). Hereafter, the software calculated the vertical distance between the 2 lines that represented the CT. 2 Ruler method; by the use of the display window and the ruler tool we measured the distance between 2 manually selected targets representing the CSB and BM. In both methods we defined the CT as the vertical distance between the hyper reflective line of the BM and the CSB. The CT was measured by 2 independent graders, and intra- and intergrader intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. Additionally, we recorded the time used for each measurement. Result(s): Data from 10 healthy subjects, 6 females and 4 males (age 15 to 17 years) was obtained. For the Segmentation method and the Ruler method, mean subfoveal CT were 354.9 +/- 93.6 m and 360.75 +/- 104.2 m, respectively (p = 0.85). For all 9 measurement targets the mean intragrader ICC were 0.99 +/- 0.01 and 0.98 +/- 0.02 for the Segmentation method and the Ruler method, respectively (p = 0.38). Corresponding values for mean intergrader ICC were 0.97 +/- 0.027 and 0.95 +/- 0.03 (p = 0.17). A shorter mean time was found for the Segmentation method (7.3 +/- 1.6 min vs. 9.0 +/- 1.8 min, p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Both methods from the inbuilt Heidelberg Eye Explorer software were suitable for manual measurement of the CT and showed high intra- and intergrader reliability. However, the investigators favored the Segmentation method which was faster and more semiautomated.

N2  - Purpose: The present study investigated factors associated with chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) progression in myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) after antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Method(s): Fifty eyes of 50 treatment-naive patients with myopic CNV who underwent anti-VEGF monotherapy with at least 2 years of follow-up data were included. The cumulative incidence of CRA progression was assessed using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics including macular choroidal thickness in various areas were compared between patients with and without CRA progression. Result(s): The mean age was 52.34 years. A mean of 4.84 anti-VEGF injections were performed over the mean follow-up duration of 44.6 months. Eventually, 15 eyes (30%) developed CRA progression. The estimated incidence of CRA progression was 10% at 1 year, 19.1% at 2 years, 23.6% at 3 and 4 years, and 35.4% at 5 years. CRA progression was associated with a subfoveal CNV location (P = 0.029) and thinner subfoveal choroid in relation to the inferior choroid at 3 mm (P = 0.008). Visual improvement was only significant in eyes without CRA progression at 1 year, 2 years, and at the final visit. Conclusion(s): CRA progression was associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Relative thinning of the subfoveal choroid with respect to the inferior choroid and subfoveal CNV location may predispose eyes with myopic CNV to develop CRA progression after anti-VEGF therapy.

N2  - Purpose: To report the ability of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) to detect the presence of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and to describe the morphological features of myopic (CNV) on OCT-A Methods: We analyzed consecutive patients affected with CNV secondary to high myopia (>6 Diopters (D) and <26mm of axial length (AL)). All patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral domain optical coherent tomography (SD-OCT; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg; Germany). Two masked observers evaluated FA and SD-OCT imaging to ascertain the presence and the degree of activity of myopic CNV. Two others observers evaluated OCT-A images to identify the presence of CNV and to describe the features of the lesion. OCT-A was performed using the RTVue XR Avanti (Optovue Inc). We proposed three types of myopic CNV features on the basis of OCT-Angiography characteristics: "sea fan" characterized by a dense vascular network, "loop" characterized by a rarified linear vascular network, and "interlacing vessels" characterized by a tortuous network with many hyperdense vascular ramifications, without significant dead space. Result(s): We enrolled 35 myopic eyes of 27 patients. Median age was 60 years-old, (range 35-71). Median refractive error was-14D (range -6.5 to -22) and median AL was 28.7mm (range 26.3 to 35.1). Combination of FA plus SD-OCT revealed presence of CNV for all included eyes, and CNV were classified as active lesions in 19/35 eyes. OCT-A allowed to visualize the presence of CNV in 23/35 (66%) eyes. Finally, 4 myopic CNV lesions were classified as "sea fan", 1 was classified as "loop", 11 were classified as "interlacing", and 8 myopic CNV showed associated forms. Conclusion(s): OCT-A is a non-invasive imaging modality allowing the visualization of CNV in highly myopic eyes in two third of cases. OCT-A does not appear to be sufficient alone to diagnose CNV complicating high myopia and at this time should be considered actually in combination with SD-OCT and conventional angiography.

N2  - Purpose: Choroidal thickness is a prognosis factor in high myopia, because a thinner choroidal thickness has been associated to macular complication as lacquer cracks and chorioretinal atrophy. The reliability of choroidal thickness measurement using OCT device is consequently important. To compare choroidal thickness in myopic eyes using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) and spectral-domain (SD) OCT devices. Method(s): A cross-sectional observational study of 29 eyes of 15 patients (median age is 58) examined with optical coherence tomography(Topcon DRI OCT-1 (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany)) was used to determine the retro macular choroidal thickness. In each eye, 6mmX6mm (SS-OCT) scans and 2 scans horizontal and vertical (SD-OCT) centered on the fovea we performed. We calculated choroidal thickness manually for the two OCT scans, using a built-in caliper. Result(s): The retro-foveal choroidal thickness differed significantly among the two OCT devices (Spectralis: 107,4 mum; DRI OCT-1: 123,9 mum; p< 0,0001) with mean differences ranging from 1 mum to 37 mum. Conclusion(s): Retinal thickness measurements obtained from DRI OCT-1 and SD-OCT are different and should be accounted for when comparing results of OCT scans from different devices.

N2  - Purpose: This prospective study conducted in German in high myopic Caucasians with pre-defined disease patterns aims to record the natural history over three years in order to identify potential risk factors for the development of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Method(s): This is a non-interventional study with yearly visits, targeting enrollment of 250 subjects in 30 German centers. At each visit, the assessments include the completion of a standardized history, ophthalmic exam, and acquisition of multimodal retinal imaging. In addition to an axial length > 26 mm, at least one of the following five disease patterns has to be present in the study eye for inclusion: (1) subfoveal choroidal thinning < 50 urn, (2) choroidal curvature length >6300um, (3) lacquer cracks, (4) patchy atrophy > 5 mm2 or (5) preexisting mCNV in the fellow eye. Eligibility is independently confirmed by a central reading center (CRC). Result(s): For an interim analysis of baseline data, a total of 191 subjects (mean age: 53.0 years, range 18.2-86.2; mean axial length 30.1 mm, range 26.0-35.7) were screened for eligibility by the CRC. The presence of at least one of the five predefined disease patterns was confirmed in 100 (52%) subjects (mean age: 56.6 years, range 21.9-86.2). The most common disease pattern was subfoveal choroidal thinning (n = 34), followed by lacquer cracks (n = 31), preexisting mCNV in the fellow eye (n = 18), followed by patchy atrophy (n = 14). Finally, a choroidal curvature length >6300 um was found in three subjects with an axial length of 34.9 mm. In 51 subjects, more than one of the five disease patterns was present in the study eye. The mean axial length of the enrolled subjects was 30.1 mm (range, 26.0-35.7). Conclusion(s): Within the prospective study cohort, there seems to be a high variability between the extent of eye globe elongation and the presence of disease patterns in myopic subjects. Identification of high risk features for the development of mCNV appears to be important for patient management and visual long-term outcome.

N2  - Purpose: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a newly developed technology which can visualize chorioretinal microcirculation without dye injection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) by OCTA. Method(s): The study design was a retrospective chart review of 11 patients (14 eyes) with mCNV who could maintain fixation during the scan process. The eyes were scanned using OCTA (3 x 3 mm). OCTA was performed using XR Avanti OCT (Optovue, Fremont, CA). All patients were women, and average age was 56.4+/-12.2 years old. Nine eyes were also evaluated by fluorescein angiography (FA) and Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) using HRA2 (Heidelberg, Engineering, Dossenheim, Germany). Myopic CNV was defined as the CNV, which occurred in the eyes with refractive error of greater than or equal to -6 diopters. Result(s): The AngioVue system can divide the retina-choroid layer into 4 layers: the superficial capillary plexuses, deep capillary plexuses, outer retina and choroidal vessels. Myopic CNV were found in outer retina in all eyes. In 2 eyes of 14 eyes (14.2 %), myopic CNV was also found in the superficial capillary plexuses due to retinal thinning. In the eyes treated with anti-VEGF therapy, we could quantify the area of CNV, and follow the regression of CNV. In twelve eyes without deterioration of visual acuity nor exudative changes in the retina, CNV were found by OCTA, and myopic CNV still remained without activity of neovascularization. Conclusion(s): Since myopic CNV is type 2 CNV, OCTA could clearly detect myopic CNV in outer retina. Our results showed that OCTA was useful in making diagnosis and follow-up in the eyes with myopic CNV. However, our findings indicated that OCTA could detect peristent CNV in high myopia, making decision of treatment for myopic CNV should be considered with visual symptom, OCT B-scan and OCTA.

N2  - Purpose: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the main cause of visual loss in highly myopic patients. This study analyzes the ability of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) to detect the presence of myopic choroidal neovascularization and to describe structural features of myopic CNV on OCT-A. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 23 eyes of 20 subjects affected with CNV secondary to high myopia (>6 Diopters (D) and >26mm of axial length (AL)). All subjects underwent multimodal imaging including multicolor imaging, fluorescein angiography (FA), spectral-domain (SD)-OCT and OCT-A (AngioPlexTM, CIRRUS HD-OCT models 5000, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, USA). The OCT-A features of CNV were analyzed and correlated with the findings of angiography and SD-OCT. Result(s): The OCT-A revealed in all 23 eyes the CNV as a large hyper-intense vascular anastomotic network. On the basis of OCT-A images, and on the basis of the literature, we proposed two types of denomination to describe myopic CNV characteristics: "interlacing" and "tangled" vascular networks. Fifteen out of 23 eyes were classified as interlacing, and 8 out of 23 eyes were classified as tangled. Twelve out of 15 CNV (80%) classified as interlacing showed activity on both FA and SD-OCT B-scan, whereas 6 out 8 CNV (75%) classified as tangled showed absence of activity. Conclusion(s): OCT-A is a very useful tool in the diagnosis of CNV complicating high myopia. Qualitative evaluation of OCT-A characteristics may allow recognizing different patterns possibly corresponding to different degrees of neovascular activity.

N2  - Purpose : To determine the prevalence and factors associated with high myopia (HM) and pathological myopia (PM) in the United States (US). Methods : Cross-Sectional Study. Study participants included individuals 18 years and older, participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and patients 18 years and older seen in clinics participating in the American Academy of Ophthalmology's IRIS Registry (Intelligent Research in Sight ). We analyzed NHANES data from 2005-2008 to determine the prevalence of HM. HM was defined as myopic refractive error of >=-6.0 Diopters in the right eye. This prevalence was then applied to estimates from the US Population Census to arrive at a diopter-adjusted population burden of HM. Data from the IRIS Registry were used to calculate the real-world rates of PM among patients with HM at the diopter level. PM was defined as HM with the ICD-9-CM code of 360.21: Progressive High (Degenerative) Myopia. This was subsequently applied to the above reference population with HM to calculate the diopter-adjusted prevalence and population burden of PM. Results : In the NHANES, 8,865 individuals (78.3%) had suficient vision and lensometry/auto-refraction data to classify their degree of myopia. In the IRIS Registry, 2,622,400 individuals (80.5%) seen across 259 clinics had suficient refraction data to classify their degree of myopia. The estimated diopter-adjusted prevalence of HM and PM were 3.92% (95% CI, 2.82 - 5.60%) and 0.33% (95% CI, 0.21-0.55%), respectively, among US adults aged 18 and older. This translated into an annual population burden of approximately 9,614,719 persons with HM and 817,829 persons with PM. The prevalence of HM in females and males was 4.88% and 2.99%, respectively [Adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) 1.66; 95% CI 1.24-2.24]. The diopter-adjusted prevalence of PM in females and males was 0.418% and 0.245%, respectively [Unadjusted OR 1.072; 95% CI 1.067- 1.077]. The prevalence of PM increased with worsening myopic refraction across both sexes. Conclusions : HM and PM impose a large burden in the US and these individuals are at risk for experiencing vision-threatening conditions such as myopic choroidal neovascularization. Females appear to be at greater risk for developing HM and PM in the US. Relating data from IRIS Registry and NHANES is a novel method for determining ophthalmic disease prevalence in the US.

N2  - Purpose : To assess the prevalence of myopic retinopathy and its associations in rural Central India in a population based study. Methods : The Central India Eye and Medical Study is a population based study in rural Central India. Of the 5885 subjects that met the study criteria, 4711 participated, resulting in a response rate of 80.1%. Myopic retinopathy was graded from Category 0 to Category 4 according to the grading by the Pathologic Myopia Study Group. Results : Readable fundus photographs were available on 4561 (96.8%) subjects (8846 eyes). Myopic retinopathy was present in 15 (0.17+/-0.04%; 95% confidence interval (CI):0.08%,0.26%) eyes of 11 (0.02+/-0.07%; 95%CI:0.01,0.04) subjects. 8 of 15 (53%) eyes had a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of <20/60 and >=20/400, and 5 (33%) eyes had a BCVA of <20/400. Correspondingly, 4 (36%) subjects had low vision (BCVA in the better eye of <20/60 and >=20/400) and one (9%) subject was blind (BCVA in the better eye <20/400) due to myopic retinopathy. Myopic retinopathy occurred only in eyes with an axial length of >26 mm. Eyes with myopic retinopathy had significantly larger optic discs than eyes without myopic retinopathy (3.69+/-1.22mm2 versus 2.52+/-0.77mm2;P<0.001). In binary regression analysis, higher prevalence of myopic maculopathy was associated with longer axial length (P<0.001; odds ratio (OR):19.6; 95%CI:4.6,82.9), higher prevalence of open-angle glaucoma (P=0.02;OR:16.1;95%CI:1.51,170), lower best corrected visual acuity (expressed in logMAR) (P=0.03;OR:0.06;95%CI:0.004,0.75), and female gender (P=0.002). If level of education was added to the model, it was not significantly associated with myopic retinopathy (P=0.17;OR:0.53;95%CI:0.22,1.31). If gender was dropped from the model, higher prevalence of myopic maculopathy was associated with lower educational level (P=0.04;OR:0.44;95%CI:0.20,0.97). Conclusions : Prevalence of myopic retinopathy in rural Central India was low (11/4561 or 0.02%). It correlated with a 16 times higher frequency of open-angle glaucoma, after adjusting for axial length and gender. If gender was excluded from the analysis, higher prevalence of myopic retinopathy was associated with lower educational level. This latter finding distinguishes adult myopic maculopathy from the myopia seen in school children which is strongly associated with higher educational level.

N2  - Purpose : It has been well known that metabolic activity of the photoreceptor- RPE complex can be reflected in distinguished autofluorescence patterns of different pathologies of the retina. These patterns can help early disease detection and monitoring of its activity where conventional colour fundus photographs show little if any of these changes. The current study is to correlate visual outcome with pretreatment fundus autofluorescence in myopic choroidal neovascular membrane. Methods : 11 eyes from 11 patients were involved in this study with diagnosis of myopic CNV that has been confirmed at the initial visit. Patients' age range was 23- 69 with mean age of 47. Patients' baseline BCVA was recorded and FAF were recorded and follow up was four weekly. Results : There was an average gain of 19 lettres in patients whether receiving Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab for myopic CNV. The median BCVA for patients before treatment was 64, and the median was 82.75 after first treatment. Subfoveal hypoflourescence on autoflourescence was associated with thickness of more than 300microns in 8 patients, less than 300microns in 2 patients. Hyperflourescence was associated with thickness of less than 300 microns in 1 patient. Conclusions : We tried to correlate the autofluorescence patterns in a group of patients with myopic CNV, before and soon after starting first treatment, with BCVA and OCT images. From our findings, we can notice there is improvement in the majority of patients gaining an average of 19 letters whether those received Bevacizumab or Ranibizumab. We can also notice that there is hypofluorescnence on FAF associated with thickness of more than 300 microns in 8 patients, less than 300 microns in 2 patients. Hyperfluorescence was noticed in 1 patient associated with thickness of less than 300 microns. Using a paired t-test, The two-tailed P value equals 0.0009, the difference is considered statistically very significant. We can conclude, therefore, in the majority of patients there is a gain of average of 19 letters on vision chart associated with hypofluorescence on FAF and thickness of more than 300 microns on OCT. Therefore, patients receiving anti-VEGF treatment for myopic CNV could be followed up and visual prognosis could be anticipated from this association.

N2  - Purpose : To describe risk factors, clinical characteristics and general disease management of patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) vs. patients with high myopia (HM) without CNV. Methods : We performed an observational, retrospective cohort (review of medical records), cross-sectional, and multicenter study. Two cohorts were designed: cohort-1 and cohort-2. Patients over 18 years, with visual impairment (BCVA <= 20/30) due to myopic CNV, and diagnosed between 6-36 months prior to the study inclusion were included in the cohort-I. Those patients over 18 years, diagnosed with HM (without CNV) and with medical history of HM since >36 months were included in the cohort-2. Nineteen centers throughout Spain participated in the study which consecutively recruited the first 10 patients with mCNV and 3 with HM. Results : A total of 185 patients were included (137 in the cohort-1 and 48 in cohort- 2; 143 eyes cohort-1 and 81 eyes cohort-2). The two cohorts (cohort-1 vs. cohort-2) showed similar characteristics according to sex (female: 82.5% vs. 79.2%), age (median [SD] of 55.1 [12.8] vs. 54.8 [13.8] years) and Body Mass Index (25.8 [5.3] vs. 24.2 [2.7] kg/m ). The main risk factors for developing mCNV (cohort-1 vs. cohort-2) were: family history (48.2% vs. 37.5%, non-significant [NS]), smoking history (24.8% vs. 12.5%, NS) and overweight/obesity (29.2% vs. 10.4%, p=0.027). At diagnosis, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) [cohort-1 vs. cohort-2] was 54.0 (17.2) vs. 70.5 (16.4) letters, and at the study visit was 61.2 (18.2) vs. 70.7 (15.2) letters. For cohort- 1, the median (Q1, Q3) BCVA change from diagnosis was +5.0 (0.0, 15.0) vs. 0 (-5.0, 5.0) letters. The mean (SD) retinal thickness (diagnosis vs. study visit) was 287.3 (95.2) mum vs. 257.5 (67.3) mum. Therapeutic management in cohort-1 was mainly by antiangiogenic drugs (79.7%; median of 1.8 [1.0] injections per patient). Conclusions : The most important risk factors for mCNV were family history, followed by smoking history and overweight/obesity, being more frequent in mCNV than in HM patients without mCNV. Overweight/obesity was significantly more frequent in patients with mCNV. The therapeutic management with antiangiogenic was the most common treatment for mCNV, showing an improvement in BCVA from diagnosis vs. HM patients without mCNV.

N2  - Purpose: Evaluating disease activity is essential for determining the proper treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). While fluorescein angiography (FA) is the most sensitive tool for CNV detection, its invasiveness limits frequent follow-up examination; furthermore, presence of lacquer crack or subretinal hemorrhage can interrupt proper visualization. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a helpful diagnostic tool; however, the correlation between OCT findings and disease activity remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the OCT findings for CNV in assessment of disease activity in association with FA findings. Method(s): This was a retrospective study including 30 patients with myopic CNV who were treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF(bevacizumab) between January 2013 and July 2015. All patients underwent OCT and FA examination before and 1 month after intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment for active myopic CNV. We analyzed potential OCT features suggestive of the disease activity as follows: presence of intraretinal cysts, subretinal fluid, CNV height, and fuzziness of CNV border on OCT. CNV network area was also measured on FA. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the correlation between CNV parameters seen on OCT with leakage degree on FA. Result(s): After intravitreal anti-VEGF injection, OCT revealed statistically meaningful improvement of intraretinal cysts in 10 eyes (21.73%), subretinal fluid in 9 eyes (19.57%) and fuzziness of CNV border in 21 eyes (45.65%) (p=0.006, 0.007, <0.001). The height of CNV lesion decreased significantly from 146.60 +/- 68.33 mum to 118.02 +/- 55.73 mum (p<0.001). FA showed statistically significant reduction of CNV network area from 0.73 +/- 0.97 mm2 to 0.50 +/- 0.89 mm2 (p=0.003). Fifteen eyes (32.61%) showed remarkable resolution of active leakage on FA (p<0.001). Fuzzy border seen on OCT revealed the most significant correlation with leakage on FA (p=0.009, R2 = 0.324). Conclusion(s): Our study demonstrated that the fuzzy border of CNV is the most common visible finding on SD-OCT and showed the most prominent improvement after intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. Furthremore, it showed the strongest correlation with changes of CNV leakage on FA. Thus, fuzzy CNV border can be considered the most important feature for assessment of CNV activity.

N2  - Purpose: To analyze the benetit of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) for the diagnosis of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and discuss the clinical utility of this method as compared to fluorescein angiography Methods: Eleven eyes of 11 consecutive highly myopic patients with suspected diagnosis of CNV underwent retinal imaging with OCTA (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) between May 2015 and October 2015. Fluorescein angiography (FA, Spectralis, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) was performed to further validate the diagnosis of myopic CNV. Result(s): In 9 eyes out of 11 patients, CNV was visualized on OCTA. 2 groups were constituted. In all eyes with CNV, the diagnosis was confirmed using OCTA. In Group 1, 9 patients with myopic CNV either naive or previously were treated with at least 1 intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF. In Group 2, 2 eyes did not show any CNV, either with FA, or with OCT A. In these two patients, final diagnosis was subretinal hemorrhage related to lacquer cracks. Conclusion(s): OCT A easily shows the choroidal neovascular network of myopic CNV. Further larger studies are required to confirm our data and state whether FA is still required in this indication.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the correlation between the duration of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and visual outcome and to identify the baseline predictors for final visual outcome. Method(s): Treatment naive patients who were received one or more intravitreal anti-VEGF injection and who were followed for at least 24 months due to myopic CNV, were divided into three groups based on the duration of their CNV (group A: <2 , B: 2-8, group C: 8-24 weeks). We evaluated the correlation between the duration of the CNV and the treatment outcomes including the BCVA improvement and the decrease in central retinal thickness (CRT) at six, 12, 24 months and at the time of their final visit. The predictive factors related to their final visual outcome as well as the recurrence of CNV were identified. Result(s): In a total 106 eyes of 100 patients; there were 26 eyes in group A, 36 eyes in group B and 44 eyes in group C. The mean baseline BCVA (0.48, 0.50 and 0.74), CRT (339.4, 317.8 and 365.5mum) and the presence of subfoveal hemorrhage (73%, 39% and 39%) di ered significantly among the groups (p=0.047, 0.010 and 0.010, respectively). During the study period, the total injection number (3.5, 4.0 and 5.5) and recurrence rates (19%, 25% and 52%) di ered significantly among the groups (p=0.021, 0.006). We could not determine the di erences of mean change of BCVA and CRT, although the final BCVA (0.16, 0.29 and 0.58) and foveal atrophy (15%, 22% and 52%) di ered significantly (p<0.001, p=0.005). After being controlled by other factors, the duration of CNV was significantly correlated with final BCVA (r=0.318, p=0.002). On multivariate analysis, patient age, duration of CNV, baseline BCVA and CNV size were significantly associated with final BCVA (p<0.001, 0.020, <0.001 and 0.004, respectively). Recurrence was related with duration of CNV, subfoveal choroidal thickness and CNV size (p=0.004, 0.023 and 0.037, respectively). Conclusion(s): Initiation of treatment as soon as possible following the onset of myopic CNV decreased recurrence rates and required injection number and consequently improved visual outcome. The CNV size and the duration of CNV were the main prognostic factors of myopic CNV after anti-VEGF injection. These results supports the hypothesis that early treatment to obtain better visual outcomes and lower recurrence rates in patients with myopic CNV.

N2  - Purpose: To analyze different tomographic characteristics and their influence in visual prognosis and need of treatment in patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Method(s): We conducted a retrospective, observational study including all newly diagnosed patients with myopic CNV from May 2013 to May 2015, receiving antiangiogenic therapy with intravitreal ranibizumab injections in a pro re nata regime. Demographic data and visual acuity (VA) were collected. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were evaluated analyzing the presence, or absence of a hyperreffective envelope around the neovascular tissue. Statistical analysis was performed with non-parametric test (Kruskal Wallis). Result(s): Twenty-seven eyes of 27 patients (mean age: 67,66 years +/- 11,42; 6 men: 21 women) were included. Sixteen patients were classified as group 1 (presence of hypereffective envelope; mean age: 68,27 years +/- 11,26; 5 men: 11 women); 5 patients were classified as group 2 (absence of the envelope; mean age: 69,25 years +/- 13,00; 5 women); 6 patients were classified as group 3 (mixed lesion; mean age: 64,72 years +/- 12,21; 1 man: 21 women). Mean baseline VA in logMAR was 0,82 (SD 0,95; 0,0-3,0) and final VA 0,42 (SD 0,43; 0,0-1,3); mean follow-up time was 10,66 months (SD 6,37; 0,0-27,37). No statistically significant differences were found between the 3 groups regarding the age (p=0.543), follow-up time (p=0.053), baseline VA (p=0,578), final VA (p=0,267), macular choroidal volume (p=0,904) and central choroidal thickness (p=0,883). Differences were observed in the total number of injections (p=0,01; Group 1: 1,8+/-1,1; Group 2: 2,69+/-1,14; Group 3: 3,33 +/-1,03). A statistically significant improvement between baseline and final VA was found only in Group 1 (p=0,006). Conclusion(s): We suggest a new anatomic tomographic classification in patients with myopic CNV based on the presence or absence of the hyperreffective envelope around the neovascular tissue. The presence of this sheath was related with a better visual prognosis with less number of intravitreal injections. Further studies are warranted in order to confirm these results.

N2  - Introduction/Background: To analyze the ability of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) to detect the presence of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and to describe structural features of myopic CNV on OCT-A. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 31 eyes of 31 subjects affected with CNV secondary to high myopia (>6 Diopters (D) and >26 mm of axial length (AL)). All subjects underwent multimodal imaging including multicolor imaging, fluorescein angiography (FA), spectral-domain (SD)-OCT and OCT-A (AngioPlexTM, CIRRUS HD-OCT models 5000, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, USA). The OCT-A features of CNV were analyzed and correlated with the findings of angiography and SD-OCT. Result(s): The OCT-A revealed in all 31 eyes the CNV as a large hyper-intense vascular anastomotic network. On the basis of OCT-A images, two types of myopic CNV were described: 'interlacing' and 'tangled' vascular networks. Twenty out of 31 eyes were classified as interlacing, and 11 out of 31 eyes were classified as tangled. Fifteen out of 20 CNV (75%) classified as interlacing showed activity on both FA and SD-OCT B-scan, whereas 8 out 11 CNV (72%) classified as tangled showed absence of activity. Conclusion(s): OCT-A is a useful tool in the diagnosis of CNV complicating high myopia. Qualitative evaluation of OCT-A characteristics may allow recognizing different patterns possibly corresponding to different degrees of neovascular activity.

N2  - Purpose: The pathophysiologic pathways that govern the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) are complex. Patchy atrophy and lacquer cracks are known to be major anatomic risk factors for the development of myopic CNV, but they are not alone and much remains to be understood about other factors that influence development. In addition, a greater understanding of the modifiable and nonmodifiable factors that influence outcome, resolution, and recurrence after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could lead to more personalized treatment algorithms that integrate parameters other than the presence of CNV itself and could help improve clinical outcomes and reduce recurrence. Method(s): We reviewed recently published data on risk factors for CNV and predictors of response to anti-VEGF treatments. In particular, data pertaining to age, sex, genetic predisposition, baseline visual acuity, axial length, staphyloma, lacquer cracks, atrophic lesions, choroidal thickness or choroidal thinning, characteristics of CNV such as duration, localization, and size of CNV, and treatment considerations such as choice of treatment, loading doses, and combination treatments were reviewed. Result(s): Our analysis showed that the body of evidence is incomplete. Conclusion(s): Additional studies are required to identify high-risk patients and to develop personalized therapeutic approaches.Copyright © 2016 Wichtig Publishing.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the etiology, clinical features, and outcome of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in children. Method(s): We retrospectively assessed 10 eyes of 8 patients younger than 18 years diagnosed with CNV.The main clinical parameters included predisposing ocular pathologies, best-corrected visual acuity before and after treatment, characteristics of CNV, and treatment modalities. Result(s): Two boys and 6 girls with CNV and a mean age of 13.9 years (SD 1.9, range 11-16 years) were included.Two patients developed bilateral CNV within the follow-up time.The development of CNV was secondary to the following pathologies: choroidal osteoma (n = 3), pathologic myopia (n = 1), punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 1), hereditary macular dystrophy (n = 2), and angioid streaks (n = 1).Idiopathic CNV was diagnosed in 2 children without any obvious associated ocular pathology.In 9 eyes, CNV was treated by intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) administration (n = 6), photodynamic therapy (n = 1), or combination therapy (n = 3).One eye remained untreated because of advanced disease. Conclusion(s): Pediatric CNV is a rare but sight-threatening retinal disease.So far, no standard treatment has been validated.Since the establishment of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, laser coagulation and photodynamic therapy have lost their significance as therapy for CNV.Copyright © 2016 Wichtig Publishing.

N2  - AIM: To present incidence, types and determinants of retinal degeneration among children with myopia of >=3 diopter (D). METHOD(S): This case series type of study was conducted during 2010-2011 at an eye hospital in Western Maharashtra, India. Children with high myopia were interviewed to record history of myopia in family members and to collect demographic information. Optometrist evaluated visual and refractive status of each eye. Ophthalmologist examined eyes of children to assess central and peripheral retinal changes. We calculated percentage proportion of eyes with central and peripheral retinal degeneration. We also reviewed the association of family history of myopia, sex, age, religion and grade of myopia with retinal changes. We performed univariate & multivariate analysis. RESULT(S): Eight hundred and forty-seven eyes of 499 children were examined with myopia of >= 3 D. In 150 eyes [17.7% (95% confidence interval 15.4-20.4)], we found vitreo-retinal degenerative changes. The rate of macular degeneration, posterior scleral staphyloma, lattice degeneration was 2.0%, 4.6% and 18% respectively. Axial length of more than 24 mm was significant risk factor (Adjusted Odd's Ratio=3.88) of vitreo retinal degeneration in eyes with myopia of more than 5 D. The compliance of visual aid was 58.4%. There were 8.8% of the 499 children's vision was less than 6/60 and they could benefit from low vision care. CONCLUSION(S): Nearly one fifth of eyes with myopia had vitreo retinal degeneration. High myopia had less vitreo retinal degeneration of serious consequences. Detailed retinal examination of eyes with myopia should be carried out periodically.Copyright 2016 by the IJO Press.

N2  - The aim of this study was to describe a new pathogenic variant in the mutational hot spot exon ORF15 of retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene within an Italian family with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP), detailing its distinctive genotype-phenotype correlation with pathologic myopia (PM). All members of this RP-PM family underwent a complete ophthalmic examination. The entire open reading frames of RPGR and retinitis pigmentosa 2 genes were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. A novel frame-shift mutation in exon ORF15 of RPGR gene (c.2091_2092insA; p.A697fs) was identified as hemizygous variant in the male proband with RP, and as heterozygous variant in the females of this pedigree who invariably exhibited symmetrical PM in both eyes. The c.2091_2092insA mutation coherently co-segregated with the observed phenotypes. These findings expand the spectrum of X-linked RP variants. Interestingly, focusing on Caucasian ethnicity, just three RPGR mutations are hitherto reported in RP-PM families: one of these is located in exon ORF15, but none appears to be characterized by a high penetrance of PM trait as observed in the present, relatively small, pedigree. The geno-phenotypic attributes of this heterozygosity suggest that gain-of-function mechanism could give rise to PM via a degenerative cell-cell remodeling of the retinal structures.

N2  - To investigate the morphological characteristics of myopic macular retinoschisis (MRS) in teenagers with high myopia, six male (9 eyes) and 3 female (4 eyes) teenagers with typical MRS identified from chart review were evaluated. All cases underwent complete ophthalmic examinations including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), indirect ophthalmoscopy, colour fundus photography, B-type ultrasonography, axial length measurement, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The average age was 17.8+/-1.5 years, average refractive error was -17.04+/-3.04D, average BCVA was 0.43+/-0.61, and average axial length was 30.42+/-1.71mm. Myopic macular degenerative changes (MDC) by colour fundus photographs revealed Ohno-Matsui Category 1 in 4 eyes, and Category 2 in 9 eyes. Posterior staphyloma was found in 9 eyes. SD-OCT showed outer MRS in all 13 eyes, internal limiting membrane detachment in 7 eyes, vascular microfolds in 2 eyes, and inner MRS in 1 eye. No premacular structures such as macular epiretinal membrane or partially detached posterior hyaloids were found. Our results showed that MRS rarely occurred in highly myopic teenagers, and was not accompanied by premacular structures, severe MDC, or even obvious posterior staphyloma. This finding indicates that posterior scleral expansion is probably the main cause of MRS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Myopia-related maculopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. The prevalence of myopia has been reported as high as 90 % in some Asian countries. Therefore, controlling myopia progression is an urgent public issue. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of topical atropine with different concentrations on intraocular pressure measurements and myopia progression in school-aged children in Taiwan., METHODS: Fifty-six myopic children were divided into three groups: 32 children were treated with 0.125 % atropine eyedrop; 12 of them were treated with 0.25 % atropine eye drop and another 12 served as a control group. IOP, auto-refractor and manifest refraction were measured at baseline and every 3 months following treatment for one year., RESULTS: There were no significant differences for the mean age, gender and baseline IOPs among the three groups. During the follow up period, no significant IOP difference was found among three groups. The change between final and baseline mean IOPs also revealed no significant differences: 0.54 mmHg, -1.28 mmHg, -0.33 mmHg for the 0.125 % atropine, 0.25 % atropine and control groups. The baseline mean spherical equivalent similarly did not differ significantly among groups but the control group showed a significant myopic progression compared to the 0.125 % atropine group 6 months after treatment, and persisted for one year. The change between final and baseline mean spherical equivalents were -0.05 D, 0 D, -1.05 D for the 0.125 % atropine, 0.25 % atropine and control groups, with both atropine-treated groups showing significant myopic retardation compared to the control group., CONCLUSIONS: Topical use of low concentration atropine for one year does not induce ocular hypertension and is effective for retarding myopic progression. However, further large scale studies with longer follow up period is necessary to validate the long term safety and efficacy., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN33002849 , 2016/01/19, retrospectively registered.

N2  - Myopia is a major cause of visual impairment worldwide. In particular, high myopia is associated with serious blinding complications, including retinal detachment, chorioretinal degeneration, and choroidal neovascularization. Myopia is multifactorial in etiology, resulting from the interaction of environmental and genetic risk factors. During the past 2 decades, a large number of gene loci and variants have been identified for myopia. There are more than 20 myopia-associated loci spanning all chromosomes. Earlier findings were obtained mainly from family linkage analyses and candidate gene studies, and more recent results are principally from genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing. Some genetic associations have been successfully validated and replicated in populations of different geographic localities and ethnicities, but some have not. Compared with Whites, Asian populations-in particular Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-have a much higher prevalence of myopia, especially high myopia. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to such ethnic variations. This review attempts to summarize and compare the allelic frequencies of gene variants known to be associated with myopia in different ethnic groups, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.

N2  - The prevalence of myopia in developed countries in East and Southeast Asia has increased to more than 80% in children completing schooling, whereas that of high myopia has increased to 10%-20%. This poses significant challenges for correction of refractive errors and the management of pathological high myopia. Prevention is therefore an important priority. Myopia is etiologically heterogeneous, with a low level of myopia of clearly genetic origins that appears without exposure to risk factors. The big increases have occurred in school myopia, driven by increasing educational pressures in combination with limited amounts of time spent outdoors. The rise in prevalence of high myopia has an unusual pattern of development, with increases in prevalence first appearing at approximately age 11. This pattern suggests that the increasing prevalence of high myopia is because of progression of myopia in children who became myopic at approximately age 6 or 7 because age-specific progression rates typical of East Asia will take these children to the threshold for high myopia in 5 to 6 years. This high myopia seems to be acquired, having an association with educational parameters, whereas high myopia in previous generations tended to be genetic in origin. Increased time outdoors can counter the effects of increased nearwork and reduce the impact of parental myopia, reducing the onset of myopia, and this approach has been validated in 3 randomized controlled trials. Other proposed risk factors need further work to demonstrate that they are independent and can be modified to reduce the onset of myopia.

N2  - Myopia is not a simple refractive error, but an eyesight-threatening disease. There is a high prevalence of myopia, 80% to 90%, in young adults in East Asia; myopia has become the leading cause of blindness in this area. As the myopic population increases globally, the severity of its impact is predicted. Approximately one fifth of the myopic population has high myopia (>=-6 diopters), which results in irreversible vision loss such as retinal detachment, choroidal neovascularization, cataracts, glaucoma, and macular atrophy. The increasing prevalence of school myopia in the past few decades may be a result of gene-environment interactions. However, earlier school myopia onset would accompany faster myopia progression and greater risk of high myopia later in life. Recently, there have been effective interventions to delay the onset of myopia, such as outdoor activity and decreasing the duration of near work. Hyperopia (<=0.5 diopters) is a predictor of myopia. Pharmacological agents and optic interventions such as low-concentration atropine and orthokeratology may slow progression in myopic children. Novel surgeries and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs could deal with some myopic complications. From available evidence, the prevention, control, and treatment of myopia seem to be promising. However, to reduce the impact of myopia in future decades, more work and effort are still needed, including that by governments and intercountry eye health organizations.

N2  - PURPOSE: A low concentration of macular carotenoid pigment (lutein and zeaxanthin) is a significant risk factor for macular degeneration. The goal of this paper is to investigate the relationship between macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and lacquer cracks (LC) in high myopia., METHODS: This is a prospective comparative observational study (NCT02205632) including high myopic patients with or without LC. High myopia was defined as a refractive error greater than 6 diopters of myopia or axial length greater than 26mm. All patients underwent best-corrected visual acuity in logMAR, MPOD measurement, multicolor imaging, SD-OCT, autofluorescence and axial length measurement. MPOD was calculated using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Group 1 was defined as eyes without LC and group 2 as eyes with LC., RESULTS: Forty-five eyes of 32 patients with a mean age of 51.3 years were included in group 1, and 15 eyes of 13 patients aged 54.1 in group 2 (P=0.56). Mean spherical equivalent was -10.11 diopters in group 1 and -15.11 in group 2 (P=0.0004). Mean visual acuity was +0.08 logMAR (0.8 in decimal notation) in group 1 and +0.11 logMAR (0.8 in decimal notation) in group 2 (P=0.061). Axial length was 27.8mm in group 1 and 29.2 in group 2 (P=0.0052). Central macular thickness was lower in group 1 (295mum) than in group 2 (305mum) (P<0.0001), and macular choroidal thickness did not differ between the two groups (P=0.094). Mean MPOD in group 2 was 0.52 and 0.63 in group 1 (P=0.042). Differences in axial length were not related to MPOD measurements (P=0.74)., CONCLUSION: A lower rate of MPOD was observed in cases of LC in high myopia. Further studies are needed to investigate if dietary carotenoids could have a protective effect in reducing the risk of LC.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

T1  - An examination of the relation between intraocular pressure, fundal stretching and myopic pathology
A1  - McMonnies C.W. 
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Pathological myopia is one of the leading causes of visual impairment worldwide. Myopic development and progression is biomechanical and dominated by axial elongation. This clinical perspective examines some of the stretch-related fundal changes, which are associated with axial elongation and myopic pathology. The biomechanics of stretching of the fundus appears to depend on genetically and/or visual experience-based scleral changes, which reduce its thickness and elastic modulus so that it becomes more susceptible to the distending forces of intraocular pressure. These changes include reduced collagen synthesis, altered collagen fibres, tissue loss, altered proteoglycans and increased matrix metalloproteinase activity. Such changes are associated with reduced scleral rigidity and related increased potential to stretch in response to intraocular pressure. As axial elongation progresses, the sclera appears likely to continue to reduce in thickness and in its capacity to resist intraocular pressure, especially when pressure becomes elevated. Tessellation, lacquer cracks, myopic crescents, staphylomata, chorioretinal atrophy and retinal detachment are examined within a model for stretching of the fundus. Age, refractive error and axial length, for example, are associated with increased pathological progression. Myopic pathological progression can become dominated by vascular changes and include a greater risk of loss of acuity and blindness. Measures to control myopic pathology, which successfully slow or prevent stretching of the fundus, appear to be key factors in reducing or even avoiding permanent visual loss associated with this condition. For example, limiting axial elongation and related myopic fundus pathology by inhibiting changes which reduce the elastic modulus of scleral tissue is a desirable outcome from interventions to control myopia. Similarly, reducing exposure to the distending stress of elevated intraocular pressure appears to be a desirable form of intervention to control myopia, especially if myopic pathology can be reduced or prevented.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic abilities of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT; Spectralis OCT) and time-domain OCT (TD-OCT; Stratus OCT). Changes in macular parameters in highly myopic eyes of glaucoma patients and highly myopic eyes of glaucoma suspects were evaluated and compared., METHODS: We collected data from 72 highly myopic eyes (spherical equivalent, <=-6.0D). Forty-one eyes had perimetric glaucoma and 31 eyes were suspected to have glaucoma (control group). All eyes underwent SD-OCT and TD-OCT imaging. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and sensitivity were examined on macular volume and thickness parameters at a fixed specificity and compared between groups., RESULTS: The highest TD-OCT AUROC curves were found using outer inferior sector macular thickness (AUROC curve, 0.911) and volume (AUROC curve, 0.909). The highest SD-OCT AUROC curves were found using outer inferior region thickness (AUROC curve, 0.836) and volume (AUROC curve, 0.834). The difference between the two imaging modalities was not statistically significant (thickness, p = 0.141; volume, p = 0.138). The sensitivity of TD-OCT macular outer inferior average thickness was highest and was 88.2%, with a specificity of 80.4%. The sensitivity of TD-OCT average volume measurements in this same region was 76.5%, with a specificity of 91.3%. The SD-OCT average thickness measurements also had the highest sensitivity in this region, which was 78.6%, with a specificity of 82.1%. The SD-OCT volume measurements had a sensitivity of 67.9%, with a specificity of 92.3%., CONCLUSIONS: Both SD-OCT and TD-OCT measurements of outer inferior macular thickness and volume can differentiate between eyes of glaucoma patients and glaucoma suspects with high myopia. These independent predictors all had good sensitivity. Based on our results, SD-OCT and TD-OCT have similar diagnostic abilities. These parameters may provide useful additional data in highly myopic eyes to complement standard glaucoma diagnosis tools.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of ranibizumab for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a clinical setting. Method(s): This was a retrospective, monocentric, noncomparative analysis of 51 eyes of 51 patients with naive juxtafoveal or subfoveal myopic CNV treated with intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) on a pro re nata basis for at least 24 months. The patients' demographic data were recorded, including the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured with an ETDRS chart, location of the CNV, grade of myopic changes, central foveal thickness (CFT), and number of administered IVR. Outcome measures were to determine the changes in BCVA, identify the factors influencing the visual outcome, compare the best visual gain obtained for each treated eye with the final visual gain, and identify the cause of the relative decline in the visual acuity, when present. Result(s): BCVA improved from 58.7 +/- 19.0 letters at baseline to 66.3 +/- 16.2 letters at the final visit (P = 0.001; mean visual gain: +7.6 +/- 15.6 letters). Multivariate analysis did not identify any correlation between the visual gain and age, sex, grade of myopic fundus changes, CNV location, or initial protocol. The mean IVR number was 3.5 +/- 2.8 injections (range 1-12; median 3) for a mean follow-up of 39.3 +/- 11.3 months (range 24-69). Twenty-one eyes experienced a relative decline in BCVA during the follow-up, which was attributable in 16 cases to myopic atrophic changes. Conclusion(s): Intravitreal ranibizumab resulted in long-term efficacy in the treatment of myopic CNV. However, some eyes may present a long-term relative decline in their initial visual gain.Copyright © 2014, Japanese Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of bevacizumab in the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathological myopia. Method(s): In this retrospective single-center non-comparative study the medical records of 29 eyes from 29 patients with naive CNV secondary to high myopia and at least 42 months of follow up were reviewed. All eyes received a loading dose of one intravitreal injection per month for two consecutive months and were retreated on an as-needed basis during the course of follow up. The main outcome measures were post-treatment ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and visual stabilization over time. Stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors for visual acuity gain and final visual acuity outcome at 42 months. Result(s): At 42 months of follow-up bevacizumab was associated with the maintenance of significant benefits in visual acuity compared to baseline. No adverse ocular or systemic effects from treatment were encountered. No statistically significant correlations were found between BCVA change and any of the quantitative variables. However, when final BCVA was taken as a dependent variable and CNV size and pre-treatment VA were included as predictors, a bivariate model was identified by stepwise regression which gave a 75 % of explained variance. Conclusion(s): Bevacizumab treatment was found to be efficacious in the treatment of myopic CNV, resulting in stable gains in visual acuity lasting at least 42 months, without any adverse ocular or general events. Myopic CNV size was identified as a significant prognostic factor.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Purpose To investigate the morphologic changes along the edge of posterior staphyloma in highly myopic eyes with patchy chorioretinal atrophy and to identify the relationship between retinal thinning and the visual field (VF) defects found in these eyes. Design Retrospective, observational case series. Methods Twenty eyes (17 patients) with pathologic myopia (myopic refractive error  8 diopters or an axial length  26.5 mm) and patchy atrophy along the staphyloma edge were analyzed retrospectively. The VFs were obtained by Goldmann kinetic perimetry. Results In the area of patchy atrophy, the inner retinal tissue was very thin or completely absent. Any remnants of the retinal tissue appeared to be adherent to the layer of large choroidal vessels or to the sclera. The mean thickness of the retina at its thinnest point in the area was 51.6 +/- 29.0 mum in 20 eyes. The retina was thinner than 50 mum at its thinnest point in 12 (60.0%) of the 20 eyes, and the mean retinal thickness at its thinnest point in these 12 eyes was 32.1 +/- 16.0 mum (range, 4 to 49 mum). Nineteen eyes (VF of 1 eye was not determined) had very similar VF findings by Goldmann perimetry, that is, a defect of the sector corresponding to the course of retinal nerve fiber over the patchy atrophy. Conclusions The results show that the thickness of not only the outer retina, but also of most of the inner retina, including the nerve fiber layer, is significantly thinner at the staphyloma edge. Such damage to the inner retina along the staphyloma edge causes the VF defects in highly myopic eyes.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All Rights Reserved.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the morphological changes before and after the formation of a full-thickness macular hole (MH) in highly myopic eyes. Patients and Methods: Retrospective observational case series. From 2006 to 2013, clinical records of patients with MH and high myopia who had optical coherence tomography (OCT) before the development of MH were reviewed. All patients had been followed for more than 1 year since MH formation to observe the morphological changes. Result(s): Twenty-six eyes of 24 patients were enrolled. The initial OCT images could be classified into four types: (1) normal foveal depression with abnormal vitreo-retinal relationship (eight cases), (2) macular schisis without detachment (six cases), (3) macular schisis with concomitant/subsequent detachment (nine cases), and (4) macular atrophy with underlying/adjacent scar (three cases). After MH formation, one case in type 1 and one case in type 4 group developed retinal detachment (RD). In type 2 group, four cases developed RD at the same time of MH formation. The preexisting detachment in type 3 group extended in eight cases and improved in one case. Among all the cases, 14 eyes received vitrectomy and 7 eyes received gas injection. MH sealed in nine eyes after vitrectomy and four eyes by gas injection. Conclusion(s): The study revealed four pathways of MH formation in highly myopic eyes. MH from macular schisis tended to be associated with detachment. However, the evolution and the results of surgical intervention were not always predictable.Copyright © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - PurposeTo assess intra/inter-observer agreement, and diagnostic capabilities of a color fundus photograph, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in making a diagnosis of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV).Patients and methodsTwo masked observers evaluated FFA and SD-OCT images to identify the presence of myopic CNV in 80 high-myopic eyes of 57 patients. A third masked observer identified CNV on a color fundus photo. Presence of myopic CNV on a fundus photo was defined as presence of subretinal hemorrhage, thickening of the retina and/or visible membrane at the macula. Presence of myopic CNV on FFA was defined as hyperfluorescence in the early phase with increase in intensity and size in the late phase; presence of a large irregular lesion; and hypofluorsescence due to subretinal hemorrhage. Myopic CNV on SD-OCT was defined as the hyper-reflective lesion with or without intraretinal fluid or subretinal fluid with retinal thickening.ResultsIntraobserver repeatability on FFA and SD-OCT was 0.54 and 0.44, respectively. Agreement (kappa) between FFA and SD-OCT was 0.38 and 0.3, respectively. Among 34 eyes, which had the presence of CNV on a color fundus photo, CNV was diagnosed in 18 (53%) eyes on FFA and in 20 (58.8%) eyes on SD-OCT. Sensitivity and specificity of FFA was 47 and 80.4%, respectively, and that of SD-OCT was 58.8 and 86.9%, respectively.ConclusionRepeatability and reproducibility for diagnosis of myopic CNV was better with FFA compared with SD-OCT; however, agreement is very poor between FFA and SD-OCT. SD-OCT is comparatively a better tool to rule out presence of myopic CNV.Copyright © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - To review the literature on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic imaging, natural history, management, therapeutic approaches, and prognosis of myopic foveoschisis. A systematic Pubmed search was conducted using search terms: myopia, myopic, staphyloma, foveoschisis, and myopic foveoschisis. The evidence base for each section was organised and reviewed. Where possible an authors' interpretation or conclusion is provided for each section. The term myopic foveoschisis was first coined in 1999. It is associated with posterior staphyloma in high myopia, and is often asymptomatic initially but progresses slowly, leading to loss of central vision from foveal detachment or macular hole formation. Optical coherence tomography is used to diagnose the splitting of the neural retina into a thicker inner layer and a thinner outer layer, but compound variants of the splits have been identified. Vitrectomy with an internal limiting membrane peel and gas tamponade is the preferred approach for eyes with vision decline. There has been a surge of new information on myopic foveoschisis. Advances in optical coherence tomography will continually improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of retinal splitting, and the mechanisms that lead to macular damage and visual loss. Currently, there is a good level of consensus that surgical intervention should be considered when there is progressive visual decline from myopic foveoschisis.Copyright © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

N2  - Macular degenerations represent leading causes of central blindness or low vision in developed countries. Most of these severe visual disabilities are due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and pathologic myopia (PM), both of which are frequently complicated by subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V) is still employed for CNV treatment in selected cases or in combined regimen. In Caucasian patients, the common polymorphism G185T of factor XIII-A gene (FXIII-A-G185T; rs5985) has been described as predictor of poor angiographic CNV responsiveness to PDT-V. Nevertheless, the prognostic implications of this pharmacogenetic determinant on long-term visual outcome after a PDT-V regimen have not been evaluated. We retrospectively selected Caucasian patients presenting with treatment-naive CNV and receiving standardized PDT-V protocol for two years. The study population included patients affected by subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD or PM. We assessed the correlations between the polymorphic allele T of FXIII-A-G185T and: (1) total number of photodynamic treatments; and (2) change in visual acuity from baseline to the end of the follow-up period. Considering a total study population of 412 patients with neovascular AMD or PM, the carriers of 185 T-allele of FXIII-A (GT or TT genotype) received a higher number of photodynamic treatments than patients without it (GG wild-type genotype) (p < 0.01; mean number of PDT-V: 5.51 vs. 3.76, respectively). Moreover, patients with 185 T-allele of FXIII-A had a more marked worsening of visual acuity at 24 months than those with the GG-185 wild genotype (p < 0.01; mean difference in logMAR visual acuity: 0.22 vs. 0.08, respectively). The present findings show that the G185T polymorphism of the FXIII-A gene is associated with significant differences in the long-term therapeutic outcomes of patients treated with standardized PDT-V protocol. The comprehensive appraisal of both anti-thrombophilic effects due to FXIII-A G185T variant and photo-thrombotic action of PDT-V toward CNV provides several clues about the rationale of this intriguing pharmacogenetic correlation. Further investigations are warranted to outline the appropriate paradigm for guiding PDT-V utilization in the course of the combined therapeutic protocol for neovascular macular degeneration.Copyright © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recently it was suggested that high myopia macular holes (HMMH) and macular holes accompanied by retinal detachment occur in the advanced stages of myopia traction maculopathy (MTM), while macular retinoschisis, shallow retinal detachment without holes, and lamellar macular holes occur in the early stages of MTM. Complete vitreous cortex removal associated with internal limiting membrane peeling is now widely used to treat HMMH. However, it remains uncertain at what HMMH stage patients would benefit most from surgical intervention. Our study was aimed to evaluate the postoperative anatomical changes and functional outcomes of high myopia macular holes (HMMH)., METHODS: Patients were retrospectively collected between March 2009 and August 2011. Before and 1st, 3rd, and 9th month after 23G pars plana vitrectomy, all patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and MP-1. At each follow-up, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), photoreceptor inner and outer segments (IS/OS) defects, and retinal sensitivity (RS) were investigated. According to different preoperative macular hole morphologies, patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, macular hole with epiretinal membrane (ERM) traction and macular retinoschisis; Group 2, full-thickness macular hole (FTMH); Group 3, FTMH with subretinal fluid., RESULTS: 43 eyes from 43 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60 years. BCVA and RS were significantly improved after vitrectomy; the mean IS/OS defect was significantly reduced. At 9 postoperative months, 11 of 43 (25.6 %) eyes achieved IS/OS junction integrity; 9 of these 11 (81.8 %) eyes belonged to Group 1, 2 (18.2 %) belonged to Group 2., CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana vitrectomy combined with ILM peeling and gas tamponade results in limited functional outcomes in patients with HMMH. The appearance of subretinal fluid indicates a worse prognosis for surgical intervention.

N2  - Purpose To determine the distribution of choroidal thickness (CT) and ocular factors associated with CT in high myopic eyes in comparison with emmetropic eyes of young healthy adults. Methods A case-control study of 648 young, male subjects, including 520 high myopes and 128 emmetropes. Choroidal imaging was performed using enhanced depth imaging spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Images were postprocessed using adaptive compensation for quality enhancement. CT was measured at nine locations, including subfovea and 1.5 and 3 mm nasal, temporal, superior and inferior to fovea. Results The CT at the subfovea was significantly thinner (mean +/- standard error: 225.87 +/- 5.51 mum) for high myopes compared to emmetropes (375.15 +/- 6.58 mum, p < 0.001). Likewise, CT in high myopic group was significantly thinner than emmetropic control group at all locations (p for trend <0.001 for all locations). Distribution of CT showed a markedly different pattern in high myopic eyes (thickest superiorly at 3 mm, 265.97 +/- 5.97 mum) and emmetropic eyes (thickest subfoveally, 375.15 +/- 6.58 mum). Choroid was thinnest at nasal 3 mm location in both the myopic (108.85 +/- 3.97 mum) and emmetropic (238.25 +/- 6.72 mum) groups. Among the ocular factors studied, axial length, posterior staphyloma and chorio-retinal atrophy were the significant predictors of CT. Conclusions Highly myopic eyes have significantly thinner choroid and showed different distribution pattern, compared to emmetropes. Axial length, posterior staphyloma and chorio-retinal atrophy are the strongest determinants of CT.Copyright © 2014 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Purpose To report the incidence and characteristics of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents or corticosteroids and to describe the clinical and bacteriologic characteristics, management, and outcome of these eyes with acute endophthalmitis in France. Design Retrospective, nationwide multicenter case series. Methods From January 2, 2008 to June 30, 2013, a total of 316 576 intravitreal injections from 25 French ophthalmic centers were included. For each center, the number of intravitreal injections was determined using billing codes and the injection protocol was recorded. A registry and hospital records were reviewed to identify patients treated for endophthalmitis after injection during the same time period. The main outcome measures were the incidence of clinical endophthalmitis and visual acuity of endophthalmitis cases. Results During the study period, 65 cases of presumed endophthalmitis were found, giving an overall incidence of 0.021% (2.1 in 10 000 injections) (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.016%-0.026%). The median number of days from injection to presentation was 4 [1-26] days. The most common symptom was vision loss. Bacterial identification was achieved in 43.4%. The most frequent pathogens were gram-positive bacteria (91.3%), including coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in 78.3%. Neither the interval between injection and presentation for endophthalmitis nor the clinical signs differentiated culture-positive from culture-negative cases. In multivariate analysis, the use of a disposable conjunctival mould assist device and the use of prophylaxis with an antibiotic or antiseptic were significantly associated with an increased incidence of endophthalmitis (P =.001). The majority of patients had worse visual acuity after 3 months of follow-up when compared with acuity before endophthalmitis. Conclusions The incidence of presumed endophthalmitis after intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors or corticosteroids was low and the prognosis poor. Prevention and management remain challenging. It remains to be determined whether the findings of this study are relevant for other countries using different techniques for intravitreal injections.Copyright © 2015 BY ELSEVIER INC.

N2  - Background: The purpose of this contribution is to report our functional results on the efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab for submacular choroidal neovessels (CNV) in high myopia, and to compare the roles of optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography and visual acuity changes in the treatment decision prior to each injection. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective study performed in Jules Gonin Eye Hospital. It included all patients with myopic CNV treated with intravitreal ranibizumab injections with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. After an induction dosing from 1 to 3 injections, the follow-up was based on a pro re nata regimen. Ophthalmic evaluation, best corrected visual acuity, and OCT were done at each visit, and fluorescein angiography at baseline and if neovascular activity was suspected. Retreatment criteria included metamorphopsia, visual loss of >=5 ETDRS letters, any fluid on OCT and/or leakage on fluorescein angiography. Result(s): 24 eyes were included in the study. Mean follow-up was 49 months. Mean visual acuity improved significantly from 62.8+/-13.8 letters at baseline to 72.8+/-12.9 letters at last follow-up visit (p=0.001). The mean number of injections was 2.2 in the first year and below 1 for the following years. The sensitivities of fluorescein angiography, SD OCT, and visual acuity loss >=5 letters were 62.6%, 51.4%, and 40%, respectively. The fluorescein angiography showed a significantly higher sensitivity in treatment decision than OCT (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): Our study has shown that ranibizumab injections provide a significant long-term visual benefit in myopic CNV with a small number of injections. Fluorescein angiography has a preponderant role in the treatment decision of active myopic CNV.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the repercussions of peripapillary detachment on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurements in patients with highly myopic eyes. Method(s): A total of 244 highly myopic eyes underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination that included optical coherence tomography (OCT) to analyze the peripapillary retina and RNFL thickness. Based on the OCT findings, patients were grouped as follows: group A: eyes with a peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation (PIC); group B: eyes with a peripapillary neurosensory retinal detachment (PNRD), and group C: eyes without a peripapillary detachment. Result(s): The OCT scans identified a peripapillary detachment in 42 eyes (17.21%). Out of these 42 eyes, 22 showed PIC (52.38%; group A) and 20 had a PNRD (47.62%; group B). The average overall RNFL thickness in groups A, B and C was 74.11 +/- 10.88, 88.26 +/- 25.72 and 72.75 +/- 16.24 mum, respectively (ANOVA test, p = 0.00). Conclusion(s): Eyes with a PNRD had a significantly greater average RFNL thickness than those without peripapillary detachment in pathologic myopia due to a misidentification of the outer profile of the RFNL. This fact makes the interpretation of RNFL thickness in highly myopic eyes more challenging.Copyright © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Design Cross-sectional study. Participants Sixty-six patients at their initial low-vision rehabilitation evaluation. Methods The patients completed all components of a routine low-vision appointment including logMAR acuity, performed the SKread test, and performed a handwriting task. Patients were timed while performing each task and their accuracy was recorded. The handwriting task was performed by having patients write 5 5-letter words into sets of boxes where each letter is separated by a box. The boxes were 15 x 15 mm, and accuracy was scored with 50 points possible from 25 letters: 1 point for each letter within the confines of a box and 1 point if the letter was legible. Correlation analysis was then performed. Results Median age of participants was 84 (range 54-97) years. Fifty-seven patients (86%) had age-related macular degeneration or some other maculopathy, whereas 9 patients (14%) had visual impairment from media opacity or neurologic impairment. Median Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study acuity was 20/133 (range 20/22 to 20/1000), and median logMAR acuity was 0.82 (range 0.04-1.70). SKread errors per block correlated with logMAR acuity (r = 0.6), and SKread time per block correlated with logMAR acuity (r = 0.51). SKread errors per block correlated with handwriting task time/accuracy ratio (r = 0.61). SKread time per block correlated with handwriting task time/accuracy ratio (r = 0.7). LogMAR acuity score correlated with handwriting task time/accuracy ratio (r = 0.42). All p values were < 0.01. Conclusions SKread scores predict handwriting performance in patients with low vision better than logMAR acuity.Copyright © 2015 Canadian Ophthalmological Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE. To investigate subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) changes following intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy and to identify clinical and choroidal parameters associated with visual outcome in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). METHODS. In 60 eyes of 54 patients who were treated with anti-VEGF injections for myopic CNV, SFCT was measured using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography at baseline, at 1, 3, and 6 months after initial anti-VEGF therapy, and at the final visit. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was compared between visits in subgroups separated based on anatomic outcome, recurrence, or resolution. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). RESULTS. At baseline, the mean SFCT was 47.6 6 24.7 lm, significantly lower than that of the contralateral eyes (59.8 +/- 34.4 microm, P = 0.022). The thickness significantly decreased to 45.2 +/- 24.0 microm (P = 0.027) 1 month after the anti-VEGF therapy. In the recurrent cases, the SFCT significantly increased from 46.1 +/- 25.5 microm at month 1 to 52.4 +/- 25.8 lm at the time of recurrence (P = 0.020); however, no significant change in the SFCT was noted in the nonrecurrent cases. In the regression analyses, the baseline BCVA (P < 0.001) and central macular thickness (CMT; P = 0.003) significantly correlated with the final BCVA, whereas SFCT or its change was not significantly associated with final BCVA. CONCLUSIONS. Subfoveal choroidal thicknesss significantly decreased following anti-VEGF therapy in myopic CNV, but showed a subsequent increase in recurrence. Subfoveal choroidal thickness may reflect disease activity and aid decision making regarding retreatment in myopic CNV for recurrent cases.Copyright © 2015 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

N2  - Choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM) associated with pathological myopia (PM) can result in significant vision loss and legal blindness. These membranes usually occur subfoveally and are a major complication of PM, developing in approximately 5-10% of such eyes. PM is the second most common cause of choroidal neovascularization after age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and accounts for nearly 60% of CNVM cases in patients younger than age 50. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A has been implicated as the major angiogenic stimulus responsible for choroidal neovascularization secondary toAMD and several major studies have proved the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment for AMD-related CNVM. Benefits have also been observed in a number of prospective and retrospective studies evaluating PM CNVM. Despite the small differences in molecular properties of ranibizumab and bevacizumab, both drugs showed similar therapeutic effects for CNVM associated with PM. Many studies also highlighted that patient age, previous photodynamic therapy treatment, axial length, and visual acuity prior to treatment may affect treatment prognosis. Although there is a paucity of large randomized controlled trials, this systematic review highlights the large numbers of individual trials that demonstrate a significant improvement in VA. The inferior long-term results of alternative therapies, combined with an excellent safety profile from anti-VEGF treatment, make anti-VEGF the current recommended first-line therapy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose To study the effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy on subretinal hyperreflective exudation detected by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) in myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Design Retrospective consecutive observational cohort study. Methods Thirty-one eyes of 31 consecutive highly myopic patients with CNV and showing a subretinal hyperreflective exudation on SD OCT were included. Morphologic changes were assessed before and after anti-VEGF therapy, based on the subretinal hyperreflective exudation thickness, retinal thickness at the level of the CNV, and central macular thickness. Results After anti-VEGF treatment (mean follow-up of 1.9 +/- 0.8 months, mean number of injections 1.8 +/- 0.6), the subretinal hyperreflective exudation regressed completely in 29 of 31 eyes (93.5%) and partially in 2 of 31 eyes (6.5%). Mean subretinal hyperreflective exudation thickness, mean retinal thickness at the level of the CNV, and mean central macular thickness significantly decreased from 102 +/- 50 mum to 2.6 +/- 10.2 mum (P <.0001), from 419 +/- 99 mum to 312 +/- 64 mum (P <.0001), and from 361 +/- 69 mum to 326 +/- 72 mum (P =.0008), respectively. Conclusion The subretinal hyperreflective exudation was an SD OCT finding that correlated with signs of active myopic CNV (either subretinal fluid/intraretinal cysts on SD OCT or dye leakage on fluorescein angiography) and responded to treatment with anti-VEGF agents. The presence of a subretinal hyperreflective exudation on SD OCT could help in making decisions on the need to perform or not perform fluorescein angiography, and regarding treatment or retreatment.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and the predictive factors associated with the need for retreatment and long-term visual outcome after intravitreal bevacizumab for myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Method(s): Retrospective cohort study of 93 eyes with subfoveal or juxtafoveal myopic CNV treated initially with either 3-monthly or single intravitreal bevacizumab injections followed by pro re nata retreatment. The efficacy was evaluated by the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) during follow-up visits. Backward stepwise multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the potential predictive factors on final BCVA, change in BCVA, and number of injections. Multiple logistic regression was performed to evaluate the potential predictive factors for retreatment. Result(s): The mean follow-up duration was 25.12 +/- 11.18 (SD) months. The mean logMAR BCVA at baseline was 0.72 +/- 0.58 logMAR (20/100 Snellen equivalent) and was maintained at 0.39 +/- 0.46 logMAR (20/50 Snellen equivalent) at the last follow-up (P , 0.001). The mean number of injections was 3.53 +/- 1.70 (range, 3-10), and a total of 25 eyes (26.9%) received retreatment. Patients who received single loading injection had significantly lower mean total number of injections (1.50 +/- 0.73 vs. 3.96 +/- 1.53). Both subfoveal and juxtafoveal myopic CNV eyes had significant improvement in BCVA (0.28 +/- 0.43 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.32 [20/40 vs 20/30 Snellen equivalent], P = 0.506), and juxtafoveal myopic CNV eyes had significantly better BCVA at baseline and at the last follow-up than the subfoveal group. Treatment-naive eyes had significant improvement from baseline BCVA, and the amount of improvement was significantly more than those who received previous photodynamic therapy (0.31 +/- 0.43 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.11 [20/40 vs 20/25 Snellen equivalent], P , 0.001). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that the baseline CNV size (P , 0.05), baseline BCVA (P , 0.001), and duration of symptoms (P , 0.05) were significant predictive factors for final BCVA, and BCVA improvement. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified that CNV size (P = 0.014) and follow-up duration (P = 0.017) were significant predictive factors for retreatment. No significant association was found for number of injections. Conclusion(s): Intravitreal bevacizumab seems to be an effective treatment for both subfoveal and juxtafoveal myopic CNV in the long term. Patients presented with shorter duration of symptoms and smaller CNV size before treatment as significant prognostic factors that predict better visual outcome. Eyes with longer follow-up duration and larger baseline CNV size may have higher risk for retreatment.

N2  - Background: Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is a rare, generalized connective tissue disorder associated with extreme corneal thinning and a high risk of corneal rupture. Recessive mutations in transcription factors ZNF469 and PRDM5 cause BCS. Both transcription factors are suggested to act on a common pathway regulating extracellular matrix genes, particularly fibrillar collagens. We identified bilateral myopic choroidal neovascularization as the presenting feature of BCS in a 26-year-old-woman carrying a novel PRDM5 mutation (p.Glu134*). We performed immunohistochemistry of anterior and posterior segment ocular tissues, as expression of PRDM5 in the eye has not been described, or the effects of PRDM5-associated disease on the retina, particularly the extracellular matrix composition of Bruch's membrane. Method(s): Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against PRDM5, collagens type I, III, and IV was performed on the eyes of two unaffected controls and two patients (both with DELTA9-14 PRDM5). Expression of collagens, integrins, tenascin and fibronectin in skin fibroblasts of a BCS patient with a novel p.Glu134*PRDM5 mutation was assessed using immunofluorescence. Result(s): PRDM5 is expressed in the corneal epithelium and retina. We observe reduced expression of major components of Bruch's membrane in the eyes of two BCS patients with a PRDM5 DELTA9-14 mutation. Immunofluorescence performed on skin fibroblasts from a patient with p.Glu134*confirms the generalized nature of extracellular matrix abnormalities in BCS. Conclusion(s): PDRM5-related disease is known to affect the cornea, skin and joints. Here we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that PRDM5 localizes not only in the human cornea, but is also widely expressed in the retina. Our findings suggest that ECM abnormalities in PRDM5-associated disease are more widespread than previously reported.Copyright © 2015 Porter et al.

N2  - PURPOSE:: To determine the relationships between the levels of intraocular inflammatory cytokines and the clinical characteristics of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in eyes with myopic maculopathy. METHOD(S):: One hundred eyes of 100 cases, including 51 mCNV eyes, 14 highly myopic eyes without choroidal neovascularization, and 35 normal subjects, were studied. The intraocular levels of choroidal neovascularization-related cytokines, like vascular endothelial growth factor, MCP-1, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-23, were determined. RESULT(S):: The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and IL-8 were significantly higher in eyes with mCNV than in high myopia eyes without mCNV with significant odds ratio of 2.00 and 2.25 per quartile, respectively (P < 0.05). When myopic lesions of patients with mCNV were classified into 3 categories based on the severity, IL-8 and MCP-1 were significantly elevated depending on the presence of maculopathy (P < 0.05). Vascular endothelial growth factor was significantly elevated in eyes of Category 2. An advancement of the maculopathy category was significantly associated with the need for multiple treatment of intravitreal bevacizumab (P < 0.05). In 12 eyes that required multiple intravitreal bevacizumab, the MCP-1 level was significantly elevated. CONCLUSION(S):: The significant associations of mCNV in highly myopic eyes with elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor or inflammatory cytokines and maculopathy lesions strongly suggest an involvement of inflammation in the etiology of mCNVs.Copyright © by Ophthamic Communications Society.

N2  - PURPOSE. To describe the topography and predictors of peripapillary choroidal thickness (PPCT) in highly myopic eyes of young, healthy, Asian subjects. METHODS. A total of 870 young male subjects aged 21.63 +/- 1.15 years were recruited from the Singapore military. Choroidal imaging was performed using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Peripapillary choroidal thickness was manually measured at eight locations around the optic disc. RESULTS. We analyzed 448 subjects with high myopia (defined as spherical equivalent [SE] worse than -6.0 diopters [D]) and 116 with emmetropia (SE > -0.5 and < 0.5 D). The mean SE was -8.52 +/- 1.20 D for the high-myopic group, and 0.11 +/- 0.24 D for the emmetropic group. The mean peripapillary choroid was significantly thinner (142.62 6 43.84 microm) in high myopes compared with emmetropes (181.90 6 46.43 lm, P < 0.001). Likewise, PPCT showed further decrease with increase in degree of myopic refractive error. Distribution of PPCT showed a markedly different pattern in high-myopic eyes (thickest superiorly) and emmetropic eyes (thickest temporally). However, peripapillary choroid in both the groups was thinnest at the inferior location. Among the ocular factors studied, axial length, IOP, presence of posterior staphyloma, and chorioretinal atrophy were the factors significantly associated with PPCT. CONCLUSIONS. Highly myopic eyes have significantly thinner peripapillary choroid and showed different distribution of thickness, compared with emmetropes. Axial length, IOP, and presence of posterior staphyloma and chorioretinal atrophy significantly influence PPCT and should be taken into consideration during clinical interpretation of PPCT measurement.Copyright © 2015 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.

N2  - Objective: To study the frequency and causes of visual impairment in relation to refractive error. Design(s): Population-based cohort study. Participant(s): A total of 6597 participants from Rotterdam Study I (baseline and 4 follow-up examinations) and 2579 participants from Rotterdam Study II (baseline and 2 follow-up examinations), all 55 years or older, were included. Method(s): Participants underwent an extensive ophthalmic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity and objective refraction, fundus photography, visual field perimetry, and optical coherence tomography imaging of macula and optic disc. We calculated cumulative risks and odds ratios of visual impairment for various refractive error categories and determined causes by using all screening information as well as medical records. Main Outcome Measure(s): Unilateral and bilateral low vision (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria, VA <0.3 and VA >=0.05; United States (US) criteria, VA <0.5 and VA >=0.1) and blindness (WHO criteria, VA <0.05; US criteria, VA<0.1). Result(s): Cumulative risks of visual impairment ranged from virtually 0 in all refractive error categories at 55 years of age to 9.5% (standard error, 0.01) for emmetropia and 15.3% (standard error, 0.06) for high hyperopia to 33.7% (standard error, 0.08) for high myopia at 85 years of age. The major causes of visual impairment in highly hyperopic persons were age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract, and combined causes (each 25%); in highly myopic persons, the major cause was myopic macular degeneration (38.9%). The major causes of visual impairment for the other refractive error categories were AMD and cataract. Compared with those with emmetropia, those with high myopia had a significantly increased lifetime risk of visual impairment; those with -6 diopters (D) or less and -10 D or more had an odds ratio (OR) risk of 3.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.2) of visual impairment; those with less than -10 D had an OR of 22.0 (95% CI, 9.2-52.6). Conclusion(s): Of all refractive errors, highmyopia has themost severe visual consequences. Irreversible macular pathologic features are the most common cause of visual impairment in this group.Copyright © 2015 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

N2  - Background: This study investigated the association of the 27 SNPs located in RASGRF1. GJD2, and ACTC1 genes with pathological myopia in a Chinese Han population. Method(s): Myopia patients were stratified according to whether they did (n + 274) or did not (n + 131) have myopic macular degeneration (MMD). The SNPbrowser software was used to identify specific SNPs for analysis and minimal allele frequency of >20%, and a pairwise r2 < 0.85 were genotyped using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Result(s): Before controlling for false discovery rate, the frequency of the rs1867315 C/C genotype compared with healthy controls was lower in the myopia group (p + 0.006) and in myopia patients without macular degeneration (p + 0.019). The frequency of the rs670957A/A genotype was also lower in patients without MMD compared with controls (p + 0.045). For rs2070664, the frequency of the A allele was higher in the patients with MMD compared to those without MMD (p + 0.032). After controlling for a false discovery rate of 5%, there was no significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies between these groups. Conclusion(s): In this study, there was no association of the analyzed SNPs located in RASGRF1. GJD2, and ACTC1 with pathological myopia, suggesting that SNPs included in our study have no or a limited role in causing pathologic myopia in this Chinese Han population.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

N2  - There is a major epidemic of myopia in developed countries in East and Southeast Asia, where the prevalence of myopia is now 80-90% in those completing secondary school. More importantly, the prevalence of high myopia is now 15-20%, exposing the future adult population to a much increased risk of pathological myopia and vision loss. In Europe and North America, the prevalence of myopia is also increasing, and now appears to be of the order of 40-60%. Genetic change cannot provide an explanation of these increases, which must involve changes in environmental exposures. The two key factors appear to be increasingly intensive education, with study pressures extending to increased homework loads and extensive use of tutorial colleges after school hours. The other environmental factor at work is the amount of time that children spend outdoors, with increasing amounts of time outdoors protecting from the onset of myopia. The time spent outdoors by children is particularly low in East and Southeast Asia, and two clinical trials have now shown significant delays to the onset of myopia by increasing the amount of time that children spend outside at school. Similar interventions could help to control myopia in other parts of the world.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Myopic traction maculopathy is common in highly myopic patients and characterized by different stages: macular schisis (MS),macular detachment (MD) without macular hole (MH), and MD with MH. MH-related retinal detachment is an uncommon complication associated with posterior staphyloma. Surgical management is based on transvitreal approach and posterior scleral procedure. Since the introduction of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV),retinal detachments with MH in highly myopic eyes were mostly treated with the transvitreal surgery. However,vitrectomy alone does not address the major risk factor of the macular schisis, which is the posterior staphyloma. To give a new shape and support to the posterior scleral wall by means of macular buckling has the advantage of releasing both the traction caused by the posterior staphyloma and the anteroposterior traction caused by the vitreous cortex. A more recent T-shaped scleral buckle has been proposed by Devin et al. We performed this macular buckling combined or not with PPV as a primary surgery or with a previous failed surgical approach in patients affected by MH with MD and MH with or without MS. In our opinion a combined surgical approach could be the most effective way to treat this disease.

N2  - Purpose High myopia is often associated with elongation and distortion of the globe, and at greater risk of developing pathologic changes. Lack of topographic and morphologic assessments hinders the understanding towards the natural history and mechanism in its development. We evaluated the fundus changes in high myopia by analyzing the eye shapes using threedimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a case series study. Methods A total of 95 patients with high myopia (spherical power <= -6.00D) in both eyes underwent a series of ophthalmic examinations. Eye shapes were categorized into spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, nasal-distorted, temporal-distorted and barrel-shaped according to the inferior view from T2-weighted 3D MRI images (Achieva 3.0T, Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands); posterior staphyloma was also identified. Fundus lesions were determined using two 45degree photos centered at macula and optic nerve by dilated fundus photography (Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The distributions of various fundus characteristics in difierent eye shape categories were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon tests. Results The participants consisted 48.4% females, had a mean age of 32.0+/-14.0 years old, spherical equivalence of -11.00+/-7.44D and axial length (AL) of 28.18+/-1.73mm. The same ocular shapes between the two eyes were observed in 72.6% of the patients. The most predominant shape in the right eye was spherical (54.3%), followed by nasal-distorted (16.0%) and cylindrical (14.9%). Barrel-shaped eyes had the longest AL and most outstanding fundus changes. Difiuse chorioretinal atrophy and larger peripapillary atrophy (PPA) were more frequently observed in barrel-shaped (100.0%, 4.7+/-2.7 disc area, DA) and nasally distorted (73.3%, 2.5+/-2.5 DA) eyes; While difiuse (77.3%) and patchy (22.7%) chorioretinal atrophy, as well as fundus staphyloma (72.7%) were more common in eyes with posterior staphyloma (n=22) determined by 3D MRI. Conclusions Barrel-shaped eyes present most significant vision-threatening conditions, while eyes with posterior staphyloma display more severe chorioretinal atrophy. Our findings suggest difierent topographic and morphologic patterns may be involved in the development of high myopia.

N2  - Purpose High myopia is often characterized by a series of pathologic fundus changes. Identifying the lesions and their location is crucial in observing the progression and predicting the severity of visual impairment. We hypothesize that the closer the lesion is to the fovea, the worse the visual acuity becomes. Thus we proposed and validated a grading scheme based on potentials of macular damage Methods One hundred high myopic right eyes were randomly selected from our high myopia database, with 50 having best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) <= 20/40(visual impairment) and another 50 having BCVA > 20/40. Two 45degree images centered at fovea and optic disc of each eye were analyzed by two ophthalmologists independently. Pathologic changes in this grading scheme included myopic maculopathy, posterior staphyloma and changes of optic disc. Aided by a self-developed software, an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grid was used to determine the location of each type of maculopathy. The maculopathy lesions and staphyloma were classified as absent, present without affecting fovea and affecting fovea area. The parameters of the optic disc were calculated by the software automatically. The inter-observer agreement of different lesions was calculated. The relationship between BCVA and the location of fundus lesions was also analyzed Results The mean age of the sample was 34.5+/-12.7 years. The mean spherical equivalence and axial length was -13.14+/-5.01D and 28.54 +/-1.90mm, respectively. The weighted kappa values for inter-grader agreement were: 0.55 for tessellated fundus, 0.91 for diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, 0.80 for patchy chorioretinal atrophy and staphyloma, 0.57 for tilted disc, 0.61 for disc rotation, 0.78 for parapapillary atrophy and 0.68 for peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation. Macular haemorrhage and macular atrophy were identified only in one case, respectively. The lesions of lacquer crack, Fuch's spot were absent in this grading. In this analysis, visual impairment was related to the location of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy and staphyloma (all P<0.05) Conclusions This grading scheme proves to be a reliable assessment tool for analyzing high myopia that achieves high inter-grader agreement and gives detailed information of the lesion location, which is related to visual acuity damage.

N2  - Purpose: Reduced macular carotenoid pigment density (lutein and zeaxanthin) is a significant risk factor of macular degeneration. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and lacquer cracks(LC) in high myopia. Method(s): Prospective monocentric double arms observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02205632) including high myopic patients with or without LC. All patients underwent logMAR visual acuity, fundus examination, SDOCT centered on the macular area, autofluorescence and multicolor imaging (Spectralis Heidelberg) or color photographs (Topcon TRC) and axial length measurment. Patients with other retinal diseases (diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, macular hole, epiretinal membrane, macular hemorrhage, central chorioretinal atrophy) were excluded. MPOD was calculated with the MPSII screening device (Macular Pigment Screener II, Horus company) using the Heterochromatic Flicker Photometry. Group 1 was defined as eyes without LC and group 2 was defined as eyes with LC. MPOD was ranged from 1 (highest level) to 0 (lowest). Result(s): Forty four patients (F/M=30/14) with a mean age of 50.3 years-old (range 23 to 69) were included in group 1 and 16 patients (F/M=14/2) aged 50.6 on average (range 34 to 74) were included in group 2 (p=0.9).
The mean spherical equivalent refraction of the patients was -10.71 diopters (between -6 and -21) in group 1 and -15.5 (between -7.5 and -24.75) in group 2 (p=0.0004).
Mean best corrected visual acuity in group 1 was 0 logMAR (range +0.9 to -0.8) and +0.1 logMAR in group 2 (range +0.7 to -0.1) (p=0.5).
The mean central macular thickness measured by SD-OCT did not differ between group 1 (294 mu) and group 2 (305mu) (p=0.1). The mean choroidal macular thickness was lower in group 2 (92mu) than in group 1 (154mu) (p=0.004). Mean axial length was 27.7 mm in group 1 and 29.1 in group 2 (p=0.01).
The mean MPOD in group 2 was 0.52 and of 0.63 in group 1 (p=0.03). Conclusion(s): A low rate of macular pigment density was observed in case of lacquer cracks in high myopic patients. If confirmed by other studies, dietary supplementation with carotenoids or nutritional recommendations could make sense to reduce the risk of lacquer cracks in high myopic patients.

N2  - Purpose: To describe morphologic features of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) on fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT), as well as to correlate them with treatment response. Method(s): Sixty-eight eyes of 65 patients with mCNV were included in a retrospective, interventional case series. The images of FA and OCT, and various clinical parameters were examined. mCNV was classified on the basis of FA and OCT findings. The clinical parameters were compared between the types, and correlated with visual acuity. Result(s): mCNV was classified into two categories: I, with leakage throughout all phases on FA and definite subretinal thickening on OCT (42 patients), and II, with leakage only on late phase of FA and mild subretinal thickening on OCT (23 patients). Besides age, other clinical parameters such as axial length showed no significant difference between the two types. With mean follow-up of 24 months, type I received a mean of 5.3+/-3.3 anti-VEGF injections whereas type II received a mean of 6.6+/-4.4 injections (P=0.171). However, visual improvement after anti-VEGF therapy was statistically significant in type I, but not in type II (+0.19 logMAR, P=0.004 vs. +0.10 logMAR, P=0.183). Conclusion(s): mCNV can be classified into two types according to FA and OCT findings. Each type showed different response to anti-VEGF therapy, suggesting that the classification of mCNV may yield important insights into treatment strategy and predicting prognosis.

N2  - Purpose Paucity of published data on pediatric choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM)s make the management of this entity challenging. We performed a retrospective, observational clinical study to describe the clinical and imaging findings and response to treatment at three high volume pediatric retina centers. Methods The charts of all patients of 18 years or less with a diagnosis of CNVM were reviewed. The demographic profile, laterality, presenting complaint, corrected vision, primary pathology, fundus examination, fundus ffuorescein angiogram (FFA) and Optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings were analyzed. The type, frequency, indications of treatment, recurrences and final visual acuity were noted. Results Out of 20 patients (25 eyes) 15 had unilateral and 5 had bilateral CNVM. The age ranged from 10.5 months to 18 (mean: 11.39) years with a male: female ratio of 1:1.5. The presenting vision ranged from finger count to 20/25.The etiology was idiopathic in 6 eyes; Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (4), uveitis (4), chorioretinal coloboma (2) pathological myopia (1), familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (1), traumatic choroidal rupture (1) and unknown macular dystrophy (1) accounted for the rest. Fourteen eyes received intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB), 4 eyes were lasered, one eye required surgery and photodynamic therapy in addition to IVB. Four patients (6 eyes) did not return for treatment. Among the treated eyes, the CNVM regressed in 9 eyes at final examination. There was an overall improvement in vision by 4 lines (1.074 to 0.6382 in log MAR). This was statistically significant (paired t-test, p=0.0361). While the minimum number of injection was 1, the maximum was 6 (avg. 3 per eye). Among those who received injection (15), 2 eyes with single recurrence were managed with repeat IVB while the other underwent submacular surgery and photodynamic therapy. Those lesions that were treated solely on the basis of angiogram even without clinical evidence of haemorrhage or ffuid also showed improvement in visual acuity. No ocular or systemic adverse events were observed in any of our treated patients. Conclusions Next to idiopathic, Best disease appeared to be an important cause of CNVM in our series. Leakage in the angiogram was found to be an important predictor of the activity. There was statistically significant improvement in vision following treatment with bevacizumab.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate current trend and future status of macula diseases focusing on patient number and treatment profile using the health insurance claims in Japan. Method(s): Among 2.07 million Japanese of same or more than 20 years who were registered in the Claims database of Japan Medical Data Center (JMDC) from 2005 to 2013, patients with epiretinal membranes (ERM), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), macular hole (MH), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) were extracted based on diagnosis codes of the International Classification of Diseases version 10. Changing trend of patient number and treatment profile were investigated during the study period. We estimated future status of macular diseases based on an oficial future popular prediction report. Result(s): The prevalence of macular diseases among adult Japanese significantly increased from 0.59% in 2005 to 1.38% in 2013 (P=0.008). The most popular macular disease was ERM of 0.86%, followed by AMD of 0.30%, MH 0.14%, CSCR of 0.069%, and mCNV of 0.025%. AMD and CSCR were more dominant in male, while ERM, MH, and mCNV were more dominant in female. All subtypes except for CSCR showed age-dependent elevation of their prevalence. Major treatment for AMD was changed from photo-dynamic therapy to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, but that for other macular diseases did not show a significant change. The patient number with macular disease was predicted to increase constantly by 2035 and its will reach to 1.6 million. Conclusion(s): The number of patients with macular diseases was increased in the past decade and this trend will be continued in coming 20 years.

N2  - Purpose: To assess baseline and follow-up characteristics of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesions in eyes with myopic CNV with respect to the development of subfoveal subretinal fibrosis Methods: In 51 eyes treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy in a pro re nata regimen for myopic CNV, degree of subfoveal fibrosis at baseline and follow-up examinations was determined using fundus photographs and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. The 2-year incidence of development or progression of subfoveal fibrosis was calculated and the best-corrected visual acuity at the 2-year visit was compared between the eyes with and without subfoveal fibrosis. The risk factor for the development or progression of subfoveal fibrosis was identified using baseline funduscopic and OCT parameters. Result(s): Fifty-one eyes received 2.0 +/- 1.3 injections for 2-year period. The subfoveal fibrosis was present in 13 (25.5%) and 28 (54.9%) eyes at baseline and the 2-year visit, respectively. The new development or progression of subfoveal fibrosis following anti-VEGF therapy was noted in 18 eyes during the 2-year period; the 2- year incidence of subfoveal fibrosis development or progression was 35.3%. Between eyes with and without subfoveal fibrosis, there were significant differences in mean BCVA at baseline (1.15 +/- 0.38 in 13 eyes with fibrosis vs. 0.63 +/- 0.48 in 38 eyes without fibrosis, P = 0.001) and the 2-year visit (0.69 +/- 0.48 In 28 eyes vs. 0.36 +/- 0.30 in 23 eyes, P = 0.010). There was significant association between the grade of subfoveal fibrosis and the 2-year BCVA (r = 0.583, P < 0.001). Although the eyes without development or progression of subfoveal fibrosis showed significant visual improvement following anti-VEGF therapy (0.70 +/- 0.44 to 0.51 +/- 0.44 logMAR, P = 0.002), those with fibrosis development or progression had no significant improvement (0.90 +/- 0.62 to 0.81 +/- 0.58 logMAR, P = 0.421). The discontinuous retinal pigment epithelium line at baseline OCT was associated with the fibrosis (P = 0.010 by logistic regression analysis). Conclusion(s): The development of subfoveal fibrosis in myopic CNV was associated with poor visual outcome. As its development is not uncommon, it can be an important cause of visual impairment in eyes with myopic CNV following anti-VEGF therapy.

N2  - Purpose To determine if optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a reliable method of detecting disease activity and therefore making management decisions in eyes with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) from Myopic Macular Degeneration (MMD). Fluorescein Angiography (FA) is considered the gold standard for detection of CNV from all causes. Long-term, ongoing management of patients with CNV most typically relies on OCT because it is rapid, inexpensive and noninvasive. Evidence of fluid on OCT imaging is considered a proxy for disease activity in eyes with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD), but its reliability is uncertain in MMD. Methods A retrospective study was conducted of 18 patients with CNV related to MMD. Clinical data collected include history, visual acuity, fundus examination, OCT and FA (on initial and some follow-up visits). MMD was defined as eyes that on examination exhibited posterior staphyloma, retinal pigment epithelial attenuation, obliquely inserted optic nerves, RPE atrophy, breaks in Bruch's membrane (lacquer cracks), and choroidal thinning on OCT. CNV was defined as progressive hyperfluorescence on FA. Results Average age at presentation was 60.7 years (range: 36 to 84). All patients had visual symptoms at presentation. In 12 of 18 patients, FA was able to detect CNV without OCT evidence of exudation. All eyes received anti-VEGF therapy (average 2.3 doses). Subsequent follow-up included 38 FA studies (in 15 patients) performed when symptoms recurred. Of those 38, 26 (68.4%) exhibited angiographic leakage, while only 12 (31.6%) had evidence of fluid on OCT. Conclusions Patients with myopic degeneration suspected of having active CNV (initially or on follow-up visits) should undergo FA if symptoms suggest recurrent disease. Management based on OCT evidence of disease activity may result in delay in diagnosis and/or treatment. OCT appears to have a lower sensitivity in detecting disease activity in eyes with MMD than in eyes with ARMD.

N2  - Background: Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) is a common complication of pathologic myopia (PM) and important cause of impaired vision. Objective(s): To evaluate the feasibility of an epidemiological study of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) using the THIN database. Method(s): Source population. The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database contains computerized information entered by primary care physicians (PCPs) in the UK. The Read classification is used to code specific diagnoses, and a drug dictionary based on the Gemscript classification is used to code drugs. Study cohort. Individuals aged 20-89 years from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011 who have been enrolled with their PCP for at least 2 years and have a computerized prescription history of at least 1 year. Case ascertainment. No specific Read code is available for mCNV, and in order to identify these cases, we used two different approaches. Method 1 composed of initial computer search of 89 related Read codes followed by manual review of medical profile with free text comments. Method 2 consisted of text string search (using two different sets of strings) and manual review of comments containing these strings. Result(s): The study cohort included 2,277,640 individuals. Method 1 identified 635 subjects as potential mCNV cases. The review of their medical profiles, revealed 16 mCNV cases (2.5%) and 18 PM without evidence of neovascularization (2.8%). For method 2, the 635 individuals identified by method 1 were excluded from the study cohort. The first search based on 11 strings to capture CNV-related comments, identified 1464 patients. After a manual review of the comments for a random sample of 100 of these patients, four mCNV cases (4%) and one individual with PM without CNV (1%) were identified. The second strategy used two strings to capture specifically mCNV and identified 29 patients, out of whom 24 were classified as mCNV patients (82.8%) and five with PM without confirmed CNV (17.2%). Conclusion(s): Recording of treatments or diagnoses of mCNV is limited in THIN. In order to capture as many mCNV cases as possible, a combination of code-based and string-based strategies seems necessary.

N2  - Objectives: To analyze the impact of indication expansion and market competition on anti-VEGF drug prices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, with a view to understanding implications for lifecycle management. Method(s): Secondary research was conducted to identify approved indications and official list prices from the British National Formulary, the French Assurance Maladie database and the German Rote List for ranibizumab (Lucentis, Roche) and aflibercept (Eylea, Bayer) from launch to 2015. Indications were reviewed based on the EMA and individual countries' official journals. Annualized treatment costs were calculated based on the official list prices and compared across countries and over time. Result(s): Ranibizumab was approved in 2007 for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In 2010, 2011 and 2013, the list of indications expanded to include diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion and pathologic myopia, respectively. Aflibercept, another anti-VEGF treatment, gained EMA license in 2012 for wet AMD and for DME in 2014. Among countries, France has seen the biggest ranibizumab list price discount, with about 44% reduction between 2007 and 2015. In Germany, price of ranibizumab dropped by 15% in 2009 before aflibercept and dexamethasone (Ozurdex, Allergan) entered the market, and has since remained stable. Price of ranibizumab in the UK has remained stable since launch. Aflibercept launched at a 36% to 42% lower annual cost compared to ranibizumab across countries. So far prices remain stable. Conclusion(s): Due to different market characteristics, the impact of indication expansion on price varies across the markets in scope. Maintaining a high list price is complicated in price regulated countries. List prices are not affected by subsequent indications in free pricing markets, where contracting and confidential discounts are usually key for access. To maintain high list prices and avoid impact of international price referencing, patient access schemes may be potential options, but acceptability varies across countries.

N2  - Objectives: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the most common visionthreatening complication associated with pathologic myopia (PM), a progressive condition characterized by axial elongation and degenerative changes in the posterior segment of the eye. This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of ranibizumab compared with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT) in patients with visual impairment due to myopic CNV in the Portuguese setting. Method(s): A Markov model was developed with health states defined by best-corrected visual acuity and a 3-month cycle length. The study has taken under National Health Service perspective and included societal perspective in an alternative scenario, considering a lifetime time horizon. The study was based on 2013 prices considering future costs and health outcomes to be discounted at 5.0% per annum. The baseline characteristics considered were retrieved from the phase III RADIANCE study (Ranibizumab and vPDT Evaluation in Myopic CNV), and VIP study (Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy). Extensive sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the model. Result(s): From NHS perspective, the lifetime cost of treating myopic CNV with ranibizumab was  8,241.73 whereas vPDT was associated with a total cost of  10,732.81. In the alternative scenario, from societal perspective those costs amount to  8,815.22 and  11.333,83, for ranibizumab and vPDT, respectively. Ranibizumab treatment produced higher cumulative qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs; 8.95) than vPDT (8.70). Ranibizumab treatment was therefore dominant in both scenarios, with greater health gains and lower overall costs than vPDT. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ranibizumab had a 100% probability of being cost effective compared with vPDT, at an informal willingnessto- pay threshold of  30.000/QALY. Conclusion(s): This cost effectiveness study indicates that the therapy with ranibizumab is dominant over vPDT for the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV secondary to pathologic myopia from both NHS and society perspectives.

N2  - Purpose: To analyse myopic retinopathy prevalence data for evidence of a discontinuity between low (physiological) and high (pathological) myopia. Method(s): Data from the three international population based studies that have examined the prevalence of myopic retinopathy at different refractive errors were analysed (Vongphanit et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2010; Asakuma et al., 2012). A wide range was evident in the prevalence data making inferences difficult; however, calculation of the log of the odds ratios of myopic retinopathy yielded more promising results. To allow comparison of the data, multiple assumptions were required including the following: openended refractive error bins at the tails of the distribution were assigned refractive error values of consistent increment to the rest of the data; study S2 did not provide a denominator for myopic retinopathy with low refractive error in odds-ratio estimates; a dummy estimate allowed the analysis to proceed without influencing the result. Result(s): Plots of the odds ratios of myopic retinopathy versus refractive error were remarkably linear in nature (S1; rsquared = 0.99, slope of 0.61: S2; r-squared = 1.00, slope of: HS; r-squared = 0.97, slope of 0.61). Averaging of the slopes yields a predicted increase in the risk of developing myopic retinopathy of 88% for each 1D increase in myopia, regardless of the amount of myopia (high or low). Conclusion(s): While some studies have identified individual genes responsible for high myopia and the current analysis finds an exponential increase in myopic retinopathy with increasing amounts of myopia, this study finds no evidence of a threshold between low and high myopia. Indeed, the highly linear nature of the log-linear plots corroborate the view that most high myopia is simply part of a continuum. Therefore, treatment methods for slowing the progression of myopia should be effective in reducing the rate of high myopia and potentially the accompanying rate of myopic retinopathy.

N2  - Introduction: Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, inhibits angiogenesis by binding to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It is administered basically intravenously for malignant neoplasms. Its off-label indication in retinal vascular disorders requiring intraocular injection can also concern women of chilbearing age. Therefore, we have only little experience about its use during pregnancy. Material(s) and Method(s): We report a case of a pregnant woman with a past history of myopic choroidal neovascularization treated with bevacizumab for 3 years (four injections a year). During pregnancy, she was administered a total of four intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, respectively at 1, 14, 20 and 26 weeks of gestation. Result(s): The patient did not have any drug-related adverse event and delivered a healthy full-term child. Discussion/Conclusion: Although human IgG are known to cross the placental barrier, findings suggest that intravitreal injection of bevacizumab during pregnancy may result in low maternal systemic concentrations. Due to potential fetal exposure, bevacizumab is contraindicated during pregnancy. There are no human studies evaluating effects of bevacizumab in pregnant women. Two cases of early miscarriage 7 and 10 days after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab have been reported to women who were respectively in 5 and 4 weeks of pregnancy at the time of treatment [1]. Considering the incidence of early-term spontaneous abortion, it is difficult to confirm if these events were directly related to intravitreal bevacizumab. Six infants without congenital anomalies have been reported whereas their mothers received intravitreal injections of bevacizumab during the first trimester for three of them [2-4]. Additional studies with more patients and longer follow-up duration are required to identify any risks associated with treatment during pregnancy. Ophthalmologists may discuss pregnancy with women of childbearing age undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. Benefits and risks should be seriously explained to pregnant women.

T1  - Clinical prediction of the need for interventions for the control of myopia
A1  - McMonnies C.W. 
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - The prevalence of myopia is increasing in Western populations but in East Asian countries, it is increasing to epidemic levels, where there are also markedly increased rates of progression to pathological myopia. Measures to more effectively control the development and progression of myopia are urgently needed. Notwithstanding a large volume of research, especially regarding the different mechanisms for the development of myopia and the efficacy of particular methods of intervention, there is still a great need and scope for improvements in clinical efforts to prevent and/or control myopic progression. Too often clinical efforts may involve only one method of intervention; however, the heterogenous nature of myopia suggests that clinical intervention may be more successful when interventions are employed in combination. The decision to prescribe interventions for the control of myopia in children, especially prior to onset, may be better framed by a comprehensive estimation of the degree of risk for the development and/or progression of myopia. For example, rather than ascribing equal weight to any degree of parental myopia, more accurate estimates may be obtained, if risk is judged to increase with the degree of parental myopia and the extent of any associated degenerative pathology. Risk estimates may be limited to broad mild, moderate and severe classifications due to lack of accurate weighting of risk factors. Nevertheless, comprehensive assessment of risk factors appears likely to better inform a prognosis and discussions with parents. Consideration of numerous environmental influences, for example, such as continuity and intensity of near work and time spent outdoors, may contribute to better risk estimation. Family-based practice appears to be ideally suited for risk estimation and the clinical application of approaches to control myopia. A proactive approach to estimating risk of developing myopia prior to its onset may be beneficial. Earlier implementation of interventions to control myopia could significantly reduce the chance of progression to pathological myopia. Copyright © 2014 Optometry Australia.

N2  - In this paper, we present a multiple ocular diseases detection scheme based on joint sparse multi-task learning. Glaucoma, Pathological Myopia (PM), and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) are three major causes of vision impairment and blindness worldwide. The proposed joint sparse multitask learning framework aims to reconstruct a test fundus image with multiple features from as few training subjects as possible. The linear version of this problem could be casted into a multi-task joint covariate selection model, which can be very efficiently optimized via kernelizable accelerated proximal gradient method. Extensive experiments are conducted in order to validate the proposed framework on the SiMES dataset. From the Area Under Curve (AUC) results in multiple ocular diseases classification, our method is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Retinal detachment (RD) secondary to macular hole (MH) is a common complication in highly myopic eyes, usually leading to a poor visual prognosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcome of silicone oil (SO) tamponade and internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in the treatment of RD caused by MH (MHRD) in highly myopic eyes with chorioretinal atrophy, and to identify clinical factors associated with the anatomical outcomes., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 21 eyes of 21 highly myopic patients affected by RD secondary to MH and chorioretinal atrophy. All eyes were treated with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with ILM peeling and SO tamponade. Anatomical success was defined as reattachment of the retina with the closure of the MH, as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), after SO removal. Logistic regression was performed to determine the clinical factors influencing anatomical success., RESULTS: The mean patient age was 59.95 years [standard deviation (SD), 10.39; range, 34-77 years] and the mean axial length was 30.58 mm (SD, 1.52; range, 27.99-34.51 mm). After the first surgical procedure, the anatomical success rate was 61.9% (13 eyes in 21 eyes), with initial retinal attachment of 16 eyes (76.2%). A second surgical approach was performed for the five eyes with persistent or recurrent RD, and the final retinal reattachment rate was 100% (21/21). Logistic regression analysis showed that no specific factors were significantly associated with anatomical success., CONCLUSIONS: Primary silicone oil tamponade and ILM peeling can be a practical treatment for repairing MHRD in highly myopic eyes with chorioretinal atrophy.

T1  - A review of environmental risk factors for myopia during early life, childhood and adolescence

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - Myopia is a significant public health problem worldwide, particularly in East Asian countries. The increasing prevalence of myopia poses a huge socio-economic burden and progressive high myopia can lead to sight-threatening ocular complications. Hence, the prevention of early-onset myopia progressing to pathological high myopia is important. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that increased outdoor time is an important modifiable environmental factor that protects young children from myopia. This protective effect may be due to high light intensity outdoors, the chromaticity of daylight or increased vitamin D levels. This review summarises the possible underlying biological mechanisms for the protective association between time outdoors and myopia, including the potential role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in refractive error development. Recent evidence for the role of other environmental risk factors such as near work, birth seasons, parental smoking and birth order are also summarised. Copyright © 2015 Optometry Australia.

N2  - PURPOSE: Excessive axial elongation of the eye in high myopia can cause biomechanical stretching leading to various ocular complications. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on various pathologic changes, especially in the chorio-retina and sclera that have been reported recently using advanced ophthalmic bio-imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and fundus photography., RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence rates of pathologic myopia (myopic retinopathy and maculopathy) mirror the prevalence rates of high myopia as the risks of pathologic myopia increase with high myopia. Peripapillary and sub-foveal choroidal thinning, scleral thinning, and deformed/irregular eye shapes were found to be strongly associated with various pathologic myopic lesions, especially with posterior staphyloma and chorio-retinal atrophy. Considering the increasing prevalence rate of myopia and pathologic myopia, these degenerative changes are likely to increase dramatically over the next few decades due to the rapid growth in the number of individuals with high myopia and the ageing population., SUMMARY: The current prevalence rates of pathologic myopia in older adults might have significantly underestimated the future prevalence rates and warrants age of onset of myopia being considered a major risk factor for pathologic myopia. Using advanced technology, identification of novel quantifiable chorio-retinal and scleral parameters in pathologic myopia would help to identify people at risk of developing pathologic myopia and potentially may revolutionise the management of myopia especially in risk prognostication and monitoring of disease progression.Copyright © 2015 The Authors Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics © 2015 The College of Optometrists.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Introduction: The aim of the study was to study the eye corneoscleral shell and connective tissue (CT) system in children with acquired and congenital progressive myopia, and to identify the informative diagnostic criteria of weakened supporting function of the sclera., MATERIAL AND METHODS: 155 children aged 9-17 were examined: 18 had emmetropia or hyperopia, 20--low, 32--moderate and 85--high myopia. 32 children had complicated myopia (CM) due to peripheral retinal degeneration (PRD). Corneal hysteresis (CH), scleral acoustic density (SAD), X-ray vertebral topography, plantography, joint hypermobility, serum cortisol (SC), and autonomic balance were measured., RESULTS: Corneal hysteresis, mmHg and SAD, rel. units (mean +/- SE) were lower if myopia was higher: in low myopia, CH was 13.0 +/- 0.3, in moderate myopia, 11.9 +/- 0.3#, in high myopia, 10.7 +/- 0.3#; SAD was resp. 215.9 +/- 5.2, 204.9 +/- 3.7# and 192.8 +/- 5.8# (#: p < 0.05 with regard to low myopia). The lowest CH (10.3 +/- 0.4) and SAD (186.5 +/- 7.3) were found in acquired CM. Congenital myopia with PRD showed CH and SAD greater than in acquired CM (p < 0.05). Serum cortisol (nmol/L) in hyperopia was 335.8 +/- 40.9 and dropped with higher myopia: in low myopia--290.7 +/- 58.6, in moderate--250.9 +/- 26.4, in high--243.9 +/- 20.5. The lowest SC was found in acquired CM, consistent with CH and SAD. Connective tissue dysplasia progressed with higher myopia: it was found in 76.9% of children with low, 82.4% with moderate, 89.2% with high acquired myopia, and 91.7% with congenital myopia. Biomechanical defects of CT and hormonal imbalance were combined with vegetative nervous system (VNS) imbalance: in high myopia only 20.5% of children were eutonic, 61.5%--sympathicotonic and 17.5% parasympathicotonic., CONCLUSIONS: School age children with progressive myopia showed biomechanical abnormalities of the corneosclera, along with CT dysplasia, decreased SC and imbalanced VNS, more pronounced in acquired complicated myopia. Our findings contribute to the understanding of myopia pathogenesis and to the diagnostic/prognostic evaluation of myopic children, in particular when deciding whether sclera-strengthening intervention is needed.

N2  - Choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM) associated with pathological myopia (PM) can result in significant vision loss and legal blindness. These membranes usually occur subfoveally and are a major complication of PM, developing in approximately 5-10% of such eyes. PM is the second most common cause of choroidal neovascularization after age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and accounts for nearly 60% of CNVM cases in patients younger than age 50. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A has been implicated as the major angiogenic stimulus responsible for choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD and several major studies have proved the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment for AMD-related CNVM. Benefits have also been observed in a number of prospective and retrospective studies evaluating PM CNVM. Despite the small differences in molecular properties of ranibizumab and bevacizumab, both drugs showed similar therapeutic effects for CNVM associated with PM. Many studies also highlighted that patient age, previous photodynamic therapy treatment, axial length, and visual acuity prior to treatment may affect treatment prognosis. Although there is a paucity of large randomized controlled trials, this systematic review highlights the large numbers of individual trials that demonstrate a significant improvement in VA. The inferior long-term results of alternative therapies, combined with an excellent safety profile from anti-VEGF treatment, make anti-VEGF the current recommended first-line therapy.
