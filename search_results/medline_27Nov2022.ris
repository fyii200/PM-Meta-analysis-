N2  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe the course of disease in patients with idiopathic multifocal choroiditis (MFC) and punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) and to identify risk factors associated with an increased relapse rate of disease activity., METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, demographical and clinical data were collected concerning the relapses rate of disease activity, the conclusions of the multimodal imaging results, treatment, complications, and self-reported quality of life. Disease activity was defined as new inflammatory lesions or active inflammation in preexisting chorioretinal lesions either with or without active choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Linear regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with an increased relapse rate., RESULTS: In total, 122 eyes of 82 patients (93% females) were included with a median age (IQR) of 45 (37-54) years. A history of secondary CNV was present in 66% of the eyes. During follow-up, the best-corrected visual acuity remained stable despite a median relapse rate (IQR) of 1.0 (0.25-3). Cycles of oral corticosteroids were given in 59% of the patients, 72% were treated at baseline or started treatment during follow-up with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), and 35% with a biological agent in addition to the DMARD. Both a history of secondary CNV (B = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.7-1.7, p = 3.6 x 10-5) and high myopia (<-6 diopters) (B = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.1-1.1, p = 0.02) independently increased the relapse rate of disease activity., DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: A history of secondary CNV and high myopia were associated with an increased relapse rate of disease activity. Moreover, the results of this study emphasize the challenging character of treating patients with MFC/PIC. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - The aim of this study was to develop an eyewall curvature- and axial length (AxL)-based algorithm to automate detection (clinician-free) of staphyloma ridge and apex locations using ultrasound (US). Forty-six individuals (with emmetropia, high myopia or pathologic myopia) were enrolled in this study (AxL range: 22.3-39.3 mm), yielding 130 images in total. An intensity-based segmentation algorithm automatically tracked the posterior eyewall, calculating the posterior eyewall local curvature (K) and distance (L) to the transducer and the location of the staphyloma apex. By use of the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve to evaluate the diagnostic ability of eight local statistics derived from K, L and AxL, the algorithm successfully quantified non-uniformity of eye shape with an AUROC > 0.70 for most K-based parameters. The performance of binary classification (staphyloma absence vs. presence) was assessed with the best classifier (the combination of AxL, standard deviation of K and standard deviation of L) yielding a diagnostic validation performance of 0.897, which was comparable to the diagnostic performance of junior clinicians. The staphyloma apex was localized with an average error of 1.35 +/- 1.34 mm. Combined with the real-time data acquisition capabilities of US, this method can be employed as a screening tool for clinician-free in vivo staphyloma detection.

N2  - AIM: To determine whether there is a correlation between the presence of macular dilated choroidal vein (DCV) and the recurrence of myopic macular neovascularisation (MNV) after antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment., METHODS: Medical records of 168 eyes of 163 patients with myopic MNV were reviewed for the presence of macular DCV and episodes of recurrences. A macular DCV was defined as a choroidal vein whose diameter was 2x larger than the adjacent veins coursing in the macular area of 5.5 mm diameter., RESULTS: Macular DCV existed in 47 (28%) of the eyes with myopic MNV. 70 eyes (41.7%) had recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 52.5+/-23.0 months. Recurrence was found in 28 of the 47 eyes (59.6%) with DCV, which was significantly more frequent than the 42 of the 121 eyes (34.7%) without DCV (p=0.003). Cox model analysis showed that macular DCV was an independent risk factor (HR: 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.5) for recurrence. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in eyes with DCV within the first 2 years after the onset than in eyes without DCV., CONCLUSIONS: Macular DCVs may be indicators of a more aggressive phenotype of eyes with myopic MNV. These eyes need careful monitoring after anti-VEGF therapies. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the 2-year outcome to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy for myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the eyes with or without dome-shaped macula (DSM)., METHODS: Data from treatment-naive myopic CNV with a 2-year follow-up were retrospectively collected and divided into two groups according to the presence of DSM. The best-corrected visual acuity was acquired at baseline, 3, 12, and 24 months. The association between visual outcomes and CNV type and area, presence of scleral-derived feeder vessel, macular atrophy, and lacquer cracks at baseline was also evaluated., RESULTS: Fifty-four eyes of 54 patients were included; 18 eyes (33.4%) had DSM. Choroidal neovascularization was foveal in 10 DSM eyes (55.6%) and in 30 non-DSM eyes (83.9%), P = 0.033. At baseline, the mean best-corrected visual acuity was significantly higher in the DSM group (68.33 +/- 12.04 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, 20/40 Snellen) compared with the non-DSM group (57.75 +/- 13.46 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters, 20/72 Snellen; P = 0.007). This difference disappeared after 3 months and did not reoccur afterward. All other parameters were not significantly associated with visual outcomes., CONCLUSION: Overall, DSM does not represent a negative prognostic factor in response to antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy in myopic CNVs after 2 years. However, in DSM eyes, CNVs tend to be extrafoveal, thus ensuring a good visual prognosis from the earliest stage of the disease.

N2  - Purpose: To apply deep learning (DL) techniques to develop an automatic intelligent classification system identifying the specific types of myopic maculopathy (MM) based on macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using transfer learning (TL)., Method: In this retrospective study, a total of 3,945 macular OCT images from 2,866 myopic patients were recruited from the ophthalmic outpatients of three hospitals. After culling out 545 images with poor quality, a dataset containing 3,400 macular OCT images was manually classified according to the ATN system, containing four types of MM with high OCT diagnostic values. Two DL classification algorithms were trained to identify the targeted lesion categories: Algorithm A was trained from scratch, and algorithm B using the TL approach initiated from the classification algorithm developed in our previous study. After comparing the training process, the algorithm with better performance was tested and validated. The performance of the classification algorithm in the test and validation sets was evaluated using metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, quadratic-weighted kappa score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Moreover, the human-machine comparison was conducted. To better evaluate the algorithm and clarify the optimization direction, the dimensionality reduction analysis and heat map analysis were also used to visually analyze the algorithm., Results: Algorithm B showed better performance in the training process. In the test set, the algorithm B achieved relatively robust performance with macro AUC, accuracy, and quadratic-weighted kappa of 0.986, 96.04% (95% CI: 0.951, 0.969), and 0.940 (95% CI: 0.909-0.971), respectively. In the external validation set, the performance of algorithm B was slightly inferior to that in the test set. In human-machine comparison test, the algorithm indicators were inferior to the retinal specialists but were the same as the ordinary ophthalmologists. In addition, dimensionality reduction visualization and heatmap visualization analysis showed excellent performance of the algorithm., Conclusion: Our macular OCT image classification algorithm developed using the TL approach exhibited excellent performance. The automatic diagnosis system for macular OCT images of MM based on DL showed potential application prospects. Copyright © 2022 He, Ren, Lu, Tang, Wang, Yang and Han.

N2  - Myopic traction maculopathy (MTM), one of the complications of pathologic myopia, is a spectrum of pathological conditions that are attributed to tractional changes in the eye characterized by retinoschisis, lamellar or full thickness macular hole, and foveal retinal detachment. Considering the global public health burden of MTM and pathologic myopia, it is important to understand these sight-threatening complications and their associations. We conducted an evidence-based review of the prevalence and natural history of MTM and associated risk factors. The prevalence of MTM in the general population is low, but is increased among high myopes. MTM is associated with preretinal tractional structures, myopic refractive error and axial elongation, posterior staphyloma, dome-shaped macula, chorioretinal atrophy, and myopic macular degeneration. The clinical course of MTM tends to be stable; however, MTM may progress, resulting in visual acuity deterioration, although spontaneous improvement also occurs. The associations of MTM progression include vitreous traction, location, and extent of MTM, and lamellar macular hole-specific factors. More high-quality population-based studies that assess MTM prevalence and natural history are needed. Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Purpose: Myopia is the most common type of refractive error and the leading cause of functional visual loss. Increased risk of myopic maculopathy, retinal detachment, glaucoma and cataract has been seen with a myopia of as low as -1D. This study was done to determine the effect of atropine 0.01% eye drops on the progression of myopia in children >5 years., Methods: This was a single-blind, prospective, randomized case-control study which included children of 5-15 years with myopia of >2D and were divided into treatment group (group 1) and placebo group (group 2). Children under treatment group were treated with application of 0.01% atropine at night. Children with history of any ocular surgery, chronic ophthalmic illness, squint and amblyopia were excluded from the study. The follow-up for myopia progression was done for two years., Results: This study showed a significant difference in increase of spherical equivalent and axial length among treatment and placebo groups after a duration of two years. Total duration of follow up was twenty-four months. Mean increase in axial length of group 1 and 2 was 0.115 mm and 0.32 mm, respectively. Mean increase in refraction of groups 1 and 2 was -0.30 D and -0.88 D, respectively, showing significant change in axial length and refraction (P < 0.0001)., Conclusion: This study supports the use of atropine 0.01% eye drops in reducing the progression of myopia.

N2  - Pathological myopia (PM) and its associated complications can lead to permanent vision loss. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying PM development remain unclear. To identify the metabolic alterations that may contribute to the pathophysiology of PM, we performed non-targeted metabolomics analysis using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry in age- and sex-matched patients with PM (n = 30) and individuals without myopia as controls (n = 30). Targeted metabolomics and insulin microarray were used to validate the results. We identified 508 metabolites in the aqueous humour (AH) and 601 in the vitreous humour (VH). Statistical evaluation revealed that 104 metabolites in AH and 114 metabolites in VH were significantly different between the two groups (variable important for the projection >1, fold change >1.5, or < 0.667, and P < 0.05). The four metabolic pathways enriched in both AH and VH identified to be associated with PM were: bile secretion, insulin secretion, thyroid hormone synthesis, and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. The concentration of 10 amino acids was significantly higher in the PM than in the controls. Insulin microarray analysis showed that insulin, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), IGF-2R, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-6 levels were significantly higher in PM patients compared to that in the controls. Thus, this study identified potential metabolite biomarkers for PM and provided novel insights into the mechanisms underlying this disorder. Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

N2  - PURPOSE: The study aimed to evaluate risk factors for macular atrophy (MA) associated with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) during long-term follow-up after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in highly myopic eyes., METHODS: The medical records of patients who received intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents as mCNV treatment and were followed-up for more than 36 months were retrospectively reviewed. The risk factors for the development of mCNV-MA, which is the fovea-involving patchy atrophy lesion adjacent to mCNV, were investigated using the Cox proportional hazard model., RESULTS: A total of 82 eyes (74 patients) were included in the study. The mean age at anti-VEGF treatment was 56.3 +/- 12.5 years (range, 26-77), and the mean follow-up period was 76.3 +/- 33.5 months (range, 36-154). During follow-up, mCNV-MA developed in 27 eyes (32.9%), and its occurrence was estimated to be 24.5% at 3 years and 37.3% at 5 years after the first anti-VEGF treatment. Old age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.054, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.018-1.091; P = 0.003) and greater CNV size at baseline (HR = 2.396, CI: 1.043-5.504; P = 0.040) were significant factors for mCNV-MA development. Eyes with a thinner subfoveal choroid were more likely to show faster enlargement of the mCNV-MA during follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: In mCNV eyes treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents, older age and greater mCNV size at baseline were risk factors for the development of MA during long-term follow-up, which was associated with a poor visual prognosis.

N2  - Nearsightedness (myopia) is a global health problem of staggering proportions that has driven the hunt for environmental and genetic risk factors in hopes of gaining insight into the underlying mechanism and providing new avenues of intervention. Myopia is the dominant risk factor for leading causes of blindness, including myopic maculopathy and retinal detachment. The fundamental defect in myopia-an excessively elongated eyeball-causes blurry distance vision that is correctable with lenses or surgery, but the risk of blindness remains. Haplotypes of the long-wavelength and middle-wavelength cone opsin genes (OPN1LW and OPN1MW, respectively) that exhibit profound exon-3 skipping during pre-messenger RNA splicing are associated with high myopia. Cone photoreceptors expressing these haplotypes are nearly devoid of photopigment. Conversely, cones in the same retina that express non-skipping haplotypes are relatively full of photopigment. We hypothesized that abnormal contrast signals arising from adjacent cones differing in photopigment content stimulate axial elongation, and spectacles that reduce contrast may significantly slow myopia progression. We tested for an association between spherical equivalent refraction and OPN1LW haplotype in males of European ancestry as determined by long-distance PCR and Sanger sequencing and identified OPN1LW exon 3 haplotypes that increase the risk of common myopia. We also evaluated the effects of contrast-reducing spectacles lenses on myopia progression in children. The work presented here provides new insight into the cause and prevention of myopia progression.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk factors for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) through inter-eye comparisons of asymmetric ocular features in patients with unilateral MTM., MATERIALS AND METHOD: Highly myopic patients with unilateral MTM were enrolled in the study. The results of comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations, color fundus images, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were reviewed. MTM and myopic atrophic maculopathy was evaluated according to the ATN classification system. The status of the posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), posterior precortical vitreous pocket, vitreoretinal interface abnormalities, posterior staphyloma height (PSH), and the location of the protrusion of the sclera were assessed through OCT., RESULTS: Among the 54 eyes of 27 patients 48.89 +/- 12.78 years of age, the affected eyes had worse best-corrected visual acuity, a longer axial length (AXL), greater PSH, and higher rates of posterior staphylomas, vitreovascular traction and epiretinal membranes (ERMs) than the fellow eyes (P < .001; P < .001; P < .001; P = .010; P = .002; P < .001). Thirteen cases present obvious anisometropia with an inter-eye AXL difference of more than 1 mm. In the 14 cases without obvious anisometropia, the eyes with MTM still had longer AXL, greater PSH and a higher ERMs rate than the fellow eyes (P = .039; P = .017; P = .001). Besides, in the 7 cases with an inter-eye AXL difference of less than 1 mm and asymmetrical stages of PVD, 5 cases with greater PVD in the affected eyes. Multiple risk factors coexisted in 96% of cases., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with unilateral MTM, a longer AXL, greater PSH, posterior staphyloma, vitreovascular traction, and ERMs were the main factors contributing to the occurrence of MTM. The process of PVD might involve in MTM development.

N2  - PURPOSE: We have been performing posterior scleral reinforcement in our ophthalmological department since 1992 on progressive highly myopic eyes. Here, we report on our results with this technique in the foregoing 7 years in a retrospective comparative design., METHODS: Thirty-eight eyes of 32 patients, operated according to Snyder-Thompson's method, were enrolled in this study, and a control group of 9 age- and myopia-matched children's 14 eyes was built for comparison. Pre- and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity, subjective refractive error (spherical equivalent of spectacle dioptres), and axial length were recorded. Changes within groups were calculated, as well as baseline parameters and their changes during follow-up, and compared between the groups. Correlation analysis was performed to identify factors that could influence myopia progression., RESULTS: Myopic progression was significantly lower in the operated than in the nonoperated group, both in terms of mean annual axial length as well as refractive error changes (0.21 +/- 0.08 mm versus 0.49 +/- 0.19 mm and 0.18 +/- 0.29 D versus 0.6 +/- 0.33 D, respectively). Mean overall visual improvement was more explicit in operated eyes as compared to those left untreated (0.15 +/- 0.09 versus 0.01 +/- 0.1). No association of any factor with myopia progression could be identified. We encountered no serious or lasting complications., CONCLUSION: In our clinical practice, posterior scleral reinforcement according to Snyder-Thompson proved to be a safely applicable and effective surgical method to stop or significantly retard pathological increases in axial length and dioptres, and thus can help prevent the onset of myopic degenerative lesions, and irreversible visual impairment in the long run.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate anatomical and visual results of eyes with naive myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in patients treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective, non-randomized, comperative, intervetional study. One hundred fourteen eyes of 114 patients with mCNV who underwent intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB), intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) or intravitreal aflibercept (IVA) monotherapy injections were enrolled into the study. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT) and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) were compared among the groups during the follow-up periods at the beginning, months 1, 3, 6, 12, and the final visit., RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 47.76 +/- 10.57 years (range, 33-72 years) and the mean follow-up period was 23.34 +/- 6.81 months (range, 13-38 months). The mean BCVA denoted a significantly improve at each group (p < 0.05). In terms of an inter-group analysis of all 3 groups, at months 1, 6, and 12 and final visit, the BCVA were statistically significantly better in the IVA group when compared to both IVB and IVR groups (p = 0.021, p = 0.032, p = 0.024, p = 0.012). There was a significant decrease in CMT following IVB (236.49 +/- 40.91 mum-190.74 +/- 50.12 mum), IVA (232.91 +/- 46.29 mum-193.73 +/- 46.81 mum) and IVR (234.78 +/- 45.37 mum-192.21 +/- 37.27 mum) between baseline and final visit (p = 0.018, p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively). There was a statistically significant decrease in SFCT values between baseline and final examination only in the IVA group (p < 0.001). The mean number of injections were 9.18 +/- 3.18 (range; 3 to 13) in IVB, 6.46 +/- 2.93 (range; 3-11) in IVR and 4.45 +/- 1.42 (range; 2-7) in IVA (p = 0.028)., CONCLUSION: All three anti-VEGFs were found to be effective in terms of visual results in patients with mCNV. However, we demonstrated that IVA reduces the need for anti-VEGF when compared to patients who received both IVB and IVR. Furthermore, IVA induced a prominent reduction in SFCT, whereas IVR and IVB did not have a significant action on SFCT. Copyright © 2022.

N2  - PURPOSE: To grade myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) patients according to the new myopic maculopathy classification (A: atrophy, T: traction, N: neovascularization-ATN) and analyze the correlation in between atrophy, traction and neovascularization., METHODS: Fifty-one eyes of 41 patients with the diagnosis of pathologic myopia and myopic CNV were included in this clinical practice study. Patients were graded according to the recently described ATN classification. Color fundus photographs were used to grade the atrophy and spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans were used to grade traction and neovascularization. Active myopic CNVs were treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. Chi-square test was used to test the categorical variants and univariate logistic regression analysis was used to predict the independent risk factors of myopic CNV scar formation., RESULTS: Active myopic CNV was observed most frequently in the group with patchy chorioretinal atrophy. Grade of the atrophy and female gender were significantly associated with myopic CNV scar in the univariate logistic regression tests. Multivariate logistic regression showed that atrophy grading is the independent predictor of myopic CNV scar., CONCLUSION: ATN classification is a practical and comprehensive system to grade myopic CNV. Atrophy is an independent predictor for myopic CNV scar and patchy chorioretinal atrophy requires a more careful examination and close follow-up for the risk of CNV development. Copyright © 2022.

N2  - PURPOSE: To identify baseline morphological predictors of lesion shrinkage in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor., METHODS: This retrospective study included 46 eyes (41 consecutive patients) with active mCNV receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. Optical coherence tomography angiography was performed at baseline and 1 year after treatment. Quantitative features were obtained from optical coherence tomography angiography images using AngioTool software. Eyes were classified as "high shrinkage" or "low shrinkage" according to the median relative change in lesion area. Baseline quantitative morphological features associated with mCNV shrinkage were identified in univariate and multivariate analyses., RESULTS: The mCNV area was significantly smaller after 1 year ( P = 0.013), with a median relative change of -16.5%. The relative change in mCNV area was -48.3% in high-shrinkage eyes (n = 23) and -5.2% in low-shrinkage eyes (n = 23). High-shrinkage eyes had a smaller mCNV area ( P = 0.013), shorter total vessel length ( P = 0.023), and higher end point density ( P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed significant associations of high shrinkage with end point density (beta = -0.037, P = 0.043) and previous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment (beta = 0.216, P = 0.029)., CONCLUSION: Morphological features of neovascularization detected by optical coherence tomography angiography can predict lesion shrinkage in eyes with mCNV receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy. Higher end point density contributed to shrinkage, particularly of treatment-naive lesions.

N2  - PURPOSE: To propose an algorithm of the major and minor diagnostic criteria for macular myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV)., METHODS: This single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study was based in Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy. Two authors evaluated the clinical and imaging parameters of eyes with high myopia (spherical equivalent of -6D or less) and suspected to have naive, recurrent, or inactive mCNV. Recordings of the eyes that met the inclusion criteria were then independently evaluated by two other senior retinal specialists. Fluorescein angiography (FA), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and OCT angiography were used for multimodal imaging., RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty-two eyes (n = 107; 39 men, 68 women) were included in the study. The mean patient age was 66 years (range, 22-89 years). There were 83 and 39 eyes in the active mCNV and control groups, respectively. The best diagnostic algorithm had positive- and negative-predictive values of 89% and 85%, respectively, and was based on four criteria: leakage/staining on FA, retinal thickening, fuzzy area on SD-OCT, and recent metamorphopsia. When excluding FA-derived findings, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) features played a diagnostic role in 33 eyes (27%). Twenty-seven eyes with active mCNV (32%) did not have the fuzzy area. Taken singularly, no clinical or imaging parameter had both sensitivity and specificity greater than 78%. Matching of 2 or 3 biomarkers did not yield a sensitivity or specificity greater than 79%. Sensitivities and specificities >= 90% were found in ten criteria combinations that included four to five biomarkers. The most frequent were metamorphopsia, fuzzy area, retinal thickening, and leakage. Less frequently, they included hemorrhage, staining, and RPE features such as elevation, flattening, and focal interruption. For all the parameters, the agreement between the investigators was good (Cohen k >= 0.66), being the lowest when detecting the ELM interruption within the lesion., CONCLUSIONS: A combination of at least four clinical and biological markers yielded the highest positive- and negative-predictive values. More ("major") and less ("minor") frequent diagnostic criteria are proposed. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the predictive factors for postoperative visual acuity improvement (PVAI) in subjects who underwent phakic intraocular lens implantation with a central hole (ICL-V4c) for ultrahigh myopia above - 10 D., METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Eyes with ultrahigh myopia above - 10 D undergoing ICL-V4c implantation were studied. Univariable linear regression models were used to assess the association between PVAI and preoperative parameters. Myopic maculopathy was classified into 5 categories by fundus photography. After the 1-month follow-up, the PVAI was compared within different age and preoperative spherical degree groups., RESULTS: This study included 726 eyes from 419 patients (111 men and 308 women), and the mean age, spherical refraction, and axial length were 28.67 +/- 7.93 years, - 13.61 +/- 3.44 D, and 28.59 +/- 1.50 mm, respectively. At baseline, myopic maculopathy was classified (grades C0-C4) as follows: C0 was observed in 200 eyes (27.5%), C1 in 297 eyes (40.9%), C2 in 147 eyes (20.2%), C3 in 22 eyes (3.0%), and C4 in 60 eyes (8.3%). The PVAI was significantly negatively associated with age and positively associated with SD-pre(-Sph), but no significant association between myopic maculopathy classification and axial length was found. After 1 month, 417 eyes (57.4%) gained more than 1 line at BCVA, 250 eyes (34.4%) remained the same, and 59 eyes (8.13%) lost 1 line. The postoperative visual acuity of 52 eyes was improved by more than 3 lines, and 42.3% were grade C4., CONCLUSIONS: The ICL performed well for the correction of ultrahigh myopia above - 10 D. Younger patients and those with a higher preoperative spherical degree had greater postoperative satisfaction., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000036335).

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe a case of high myopia in a pediatric patient with a mutation in the OTX2 gene and further characterize the diverse ocular phenotypes of heterozygous OTX2 mutations., PATIENT AND METHODS: We describe a three-year-old girl who presented at two months old with abnormal eye movements and suspected retinal dystrophy. Clinical exam and electroretinography (ERG) were conducted, and molecular next generation sequencing (NGS) with the Inherited Retinal Dystrophies panel was completed in our patient and offered to the family., RESULTS: Further examination revealed progressive high myopia in our patient and her mother, alongside diffuse retinal thinning and normal ERG. NGS identified a likely pathogenic variant in the OTX2 gene (c.235 G > A) that was maternal in origin. There were no extra-ocular concerns in our patient, and brain MRI was normal., CONCLUSIONS: While OTX2 mutations are known to cause retinopathy, this case presents a unique phenotype through a heterozygous missense variant (c.235 G > A) underlying high myopia in a three-generation family. This case further supports the role of OTX2 in ocular development and demonstrates the variable expressivity of OTX2 mutations. Genetic testing in families with high myopia may be useful in future surveillance and preparation for ocular and extra-ocular complications associated with OTX2-syndrome presentations.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the shape of posterior staphylomas using ultra-widefield optical coherence tomographic (UWF-OCT) images and to identify the factors contributing to the shape and grade of the staphylomas in eyes with pathologic myopia., Methods: This was an observational case series study. Highly myopic patients who were >=40 years old with wide or narrow type of macular staphylomas were studied. High myopia was defined as a myopic refractive error (spherical equivalent) greater than -8.0 diopters (D) or an axial length (AL) > 26.5 mm. The maximum diameter and depth of the staphylomas were measured in the 12 radial scans of UWF-OCT images by ImageJ software and were compared between the two types of staphylomas., Results: We studied 197 eyes of 138 patients with a mean age of 64.7 +/- 10.4 years and mean AL of 30.0 +/- 1.9 mm. The AL was significantly longer in the eyes with the narrow type than the wide type of staphyloma (P = 0.036). Multiple regression analyses showed that age was significantly correlated with the maximum depth/maximum diameter ratio (wide type, P < 0.001; narrow type, P = 0.003) of both types of staphylomas. The AL was significantly correlated with the depth/diameter ratio of only the narrow type of staphylomas (P = 0.005)., Conclusions: The significant correlations of age and AL with the wide and narrow types of posterior staphylomas indicate that the factors for their formations may be distinctly different. Quantitative analyses of UWF-OCT images are helpful in determining the shape of the staphylomas.

N2  - The objective of this prospective study was to investigate the morphological changes of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) after treatment with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor and to identify potential features predictive of the final BCVA. OCT and OCTA features were evaluated at baseline and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Parameters investigated were the maturity pattern, presence of mCNV OCT activity signs, subretinal fibrosis and mCNV area. Forty patients (41 eyes) were included in the study. At the final visit, after a mean of 3.1 +/- 1.4 injections, BCVA had improved significantly (p = 0.009) and subretinal hyperreflective exudation, subretinal fluid and intraretinal cysts nearly disappeared at 12 months. At baseline, 20 eyes had an immature CNV that were smaller, required less injections (2.5 +/- 1.2 vs 3.8 +/- 1.4, p = 0.002), they completely regressed in seven eyes and achieved a better BCVA (0.14 +/- 0.15 vs 0.40 +/- 0.26 logMAR, p < 0.001) when compared to mature CNV. Subretinal fibrosis developed in 19 eyes (46.3%) with lower final BCVA than eyes without fibrosis (0.19 +/- 0.24 vs 0.38 +/- 0.22 logMAR, p = 0.012). Baseline immature pattern (p = 0.005) and baseline BCVA (p < 0.001) were predictive of final BCVA. Multimodal imaging is useful to define mCNV changes during treatment. OCTA provides prognostic information which cannot achieved by other imaging techniques. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

N2  - Exosomes, nanosized extracellular vesicles with a size of 30-150nm, contain many biological materials, such as messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), proteins, and transcription factors. It has been identified in all biological fluids and recognized as an important part of intercellular communication. While the role of exosomes in cancer has been studied in-depth, our understanding of their relevance for ocular tissues has just begun to evolve. Intraocular fluids, including aqueous humor and vitreous humor, play a role in nourishing eye tissues and in expelling metabolites. In the pathological state, intraocular exosomes can mediate pathological processes such as ECM remodeling, retinal inflammation, and blood-retinal barrier dysfunction. Herein, we reviewed the latest advances of intraocular exosomes in the research of several eye diseases, including glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, myopia, and ocular tumors, and discuss how intraocular exosomes contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of multiple eye diseases.

N2  - Blood vessel dysfunction causes several retinal diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, macular degeneration and choroidal neovascularization in pathological myopia. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-neutralizing proteins provide benefits in most of those diseases, yet unsolved haemorrhage and frequent intraocular injections still bothered patients. Here, we identified endothelial CD146 as a new target for retinal diseases. CD146 expression was activated in two ocular pathological angiogenesis models, a laser-induced choroid neovascularization model and an oxygen-induced retinopathy model. The absence of CD146 impaired hypoxia-induced cell migration and angiogenesis both in cell lines and animal model. Preventive or therapeutic treatment with anti-CD146 antibody AA98 significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced aberrant retinal angiogenesis in two retinal disease models. Mechanistically, under hypoxia condition, CD146 was involved in the activation of NFkappaB, Erk and Akt signalling pathways, which are partially independent of VEGF. Consistently, anti-CD146 therapy combined with anti-VEGF therapy showed enhanced impairment effect of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Given the critical role of abnormal angiogenesis in retinal and choroidal diseases, our results provide novel insights into combinatorial therapy for neovascular fundus diseases. Copyright © 2021.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the features in the posterior pole of highly myopic (HM) eyes using a wide-field high-resolution swept source optical coherence tomography (SS OCT)., METHODS: This observational cross-sectional study involved 262 eyes of 139 patients, who were diagnosed as HM and had consecutively been examined by SS OCT in the Ophthalmology Department of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital between March 2019 and December 2019. The characteristics of OCT images were documented and analyzed., RESULTS: In our study, SS OCT could demonstrate the entire layer of the choroid and detect the sclera in all eyes. The mean subfoveal retinal/choroidal/scleral thickness were 204.84 +/- 119.86 mum, 92.80 +/- 75.78 mum and 394.734 +/- 123.09 mum, respectively. 138 eyes (52.67%) had posterior precortical vitreous pocket. Myopic foveoschisis was detected in 110 eyes (41.98%), and significantly associated with the presence of posterior staphyloma. 36 eyes (13.74%) had DSM in our study, of which 8 eyes (22.22%) showed a round dome, 16 (44.44%) were horizontal oval-shaped, 9 (25%) were vertical oval-shaped and 3 (8.34%) were oblique oval-shaped. Both SFCT and SFST were inversely and significantly associated with age and refractive errors. Macular neovascularization was significantly correlated with intrascleral vessels. Different deformation of the sclera and posterior staphyloma were vividly identified on SS OCT images., CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a relatively comprehensive picture of posterior pole in HM eyes. Such good visualization of ocular fundus provided by wide-field SS OCT could be useful for the therapy option, disease condition monitoring and pathogenesis investigation.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the transancestry portability of current myopia polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to predict high myopia (HM) and myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in an Asian population., DESIGN: Population-based study., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5894 adults (2141 Chinese, 1913 Indian, and 1840 Malay) from the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study were included in the analysis. The mean +/- standard deviation age was 57.05 +/- 9.31 years. A total of 361 adults had a diagnosis of HM (spherical equivalent [SE] < -5.00 diopters [D]) from refraction measurements, 240 individuals had a diagnosis of MMD graded by the International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy criteria from fundus photographs, and 3774 individuals were control participants without myopia (SE > -0.5 D)., METHODS: The PRS, derived from 687 289 HapMap3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the largest genome-wide association study of myopia in Europeans to date (n = 260 974), was assessed on its ability to predict patients with HM and MMD versus control participants., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to predict HM and MMD., RESULTS: The PRS had an AUC of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.75) for HM and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.63-0.70) for MMD versus no myopia. The inclusion of the PRS with other predictors (age, sex, educational attainment [EA], and ancestry; age-by-ancestry, sex-by-ancestry, and EA-by-ancestry interactions; and 20 genotypic principal components) increased the AUC to 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86) for HM and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.82) for MMD. Individuals with a PRS in the top 5% showed up to a 4.66 (95% CI, 3.34-6.42) times higher risk of HM developing and up to a 3.43 (95% CI, 2.27-5.05) times higher risk of MMD developing compared with the remaining 95% of individuals., CONCLUSIONS: The PRS is a good predictor for HM and facilitates the identification of high-risk children to prevent myopia progression to HM. In addition, the PRS also predicts MMD and helps to identify high-risk adults with myopia who require closer monitoring for myopia-related complications.

N2  - AIM: To explore and evaluate an appropriate deep learning system (DLS) for the detection of 12 major fundus diseases using colour fundus photography., METHODS: Diagnostic performance of a DLS was tested on the detection of normal fundus and 12 major fundus diseases including referable diabetic retinopathy, pathologic myopic retinal degeneration, retinal vein occlusion, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment, wet and dry age-related macular degeneration, epiretinal membrane, macula hole, possible glaucomatous optic neuropathy, papilledema and optic nerve atrophy. The DLS was developed with 56 738 images and tested with 8176 images from one internal test set and two external test sets. The comparison with human doctors was also conducted., RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the DLS on the internal test set and the two external test sets were 0.950 (95% CI 0.942 to 0.957) to 0.996 (95% CI 0.994 to 0.998), 0.931 (95% CI 0.923 to 0.939) to 1.000 (95% CI 0.999 to 1.000) and 0.934 (95% CI 0.929 to 0.938) to 1.000 (95% CI 0.999 to 1.000), with sensitivities of 80.4% (95% CI 79.1% to 81.6%) to 97.3% (95% CI 96.7% to 97.8%), 64.6% (95% CI 63.0% to 66.1%) to 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%) and 68.0% (95% CI 67.1% to 68.9%) to 100% (95% CI 100% to 100%), respectively, and specificities of 89.7% (95% CI 88.8% to 90.7%) to 98.1% (95%CI 97.7% to 98.6%), 78.7% (95% CI 77.4% to 80.0%) to 99.6% (95% CI 99.4% to 99.8%) and 88.1% (95% CI 87.4% to 88.7%) to 98.7% (95% CI 98.5% to 99.0%), respectively. When compared with human doctors, the DLS obtained a higher diagnostic sensitivity but lower specificity., CONCLUSION: The proposed DLS is effective in diagnosing normal fundus and 12 major fundus diseases, and thus has much potential for fundus diseases screening in the real world.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the relationship of demographics, clinical characteristics and structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings to disease recurrence in a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed myopic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) METHODS: In this retrospective, longitudinal study, a total of 64 participants (64 eyes) with successfully treated myopic CNV had obtained resolution of exudation after treatment (study baseline) and with 3 years of regular follow-ups. Several baseline OCT qualitative features and quantitative measurements were assessed at baseline and included in the analysis. Main outcome measures included incidence of disease recurrence and HR for demographics, clinical characteristics and OCT risk factors., RESULTS: At month 36, 40 eyes (62.5%) developed disease recurrence (active CNV). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that final visual acuity (dependent variable) was associated with visual acuity at the first visit after complete resolution of exudation (p<0.0001), baseline size of patchy atrophy (p=0.010), baseline subfoveal choroidal thickness (p=0.008), baseline maximum CNV height and width (p=0.011 and p=0.003) and recurrence of CNV exudation (p=0.007). The following factors were associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence: size of patchy atrophy had an HR of 1.14 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.29; p=0.036); maximum CNV width had an HR of 1.02 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.04; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: We identified OCT risk factors for the disease recurrence in eyes with successfully treated myopic CNV. Assuming that disease recurrence is a sight-threatening event, our findings may help in the identification of high-risk patients and eventually ameliorate their outcome.

N2  - We utilized the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database which was stemmed from the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to conduct a retrospective cohort study investigating the risk of becoming dialysis dependent after receiving intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for retinal diseases. Patients newly receiving intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept from 2000 to 2017 for age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, diabetic macular edema, retinal vein occlusions, or myopic choroid neovascularization were included as the study group, and patients with same retinal diseases but did not receive intravitreal anti-VEGFs served as controls extracted by age- and sex-matched (1:4) and further propensity score matching (PSM). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of dialysis. A cohort of 2447 anti-VEGF users and 2447 controls by PSM were evaluated. Higher dialysis risks were observed among patients newly receiving anti-VEGF agents compared to controls (adjusted HR: 1.849; 95% CI: 1.378-2.482) in the PSM cohort. For subgroup analysis, patients newly receiving anti-VEGF treatment for diabetic macular edema had significant risk (adjusted HR: 1.834; 95% CI: 1.448-2.324) of becoming dialysis-dependent, while patients in other subgroups demonstrated similar risks as the controls. In conclusion, intravitreal anti-VEGF agents might increase the risk of becoming dialysis-dependent, especially in patients who are treated for diabetic macular edema.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the percentages and risk factors for visual impairment (VI) across age groups in a highly myopic cohort with a wide range of age (18-93 years)., METHODS: A total of 2099 eyes (1220 participants) were enrolled. All participants underwent detailed ocular examinations. Myopic maculopathy (MM) was assessed as myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) or myopic neovascular maculopathy (MNM) based on the ATN system., RESULTS: Most participants younger than 50 years had normal vision, while the cumulative risk of VI and blindness gradually increased after 50-59 years. The percentage of each type of MM increased nonlinearly with ageing (all p < 0.001), with an accelerated period of increase after 45 years for MAM, and after 50 years for MTM and MNM. Axial length (AL) >=30 mm was the only associated factor for mild VI or worse in participants aged 18-39 years (p < 0.001). Older age, AL >=30 mm and the presence of MAM were predictors for mild VI or worse in the group aged 40-49 years (all p < 0.05). In participants aged >=50 years, older age, female sex, longer AL and increased severity of MM were risk factors for VI and blindness (all p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: The percentages of MM and related VI increased nonlinearly with older age, with a turning point at 45 years for MAM, preceding that of MTM, MNM and VI by 5 years, warranting future longitudinal studies to confirm. Different age groups presented different risk factors for VI. Timely screening should be in place for middle-aged high myopes. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate incidence, predictors, and re-treatment outcome of recurrent myopic choroidal neovascularization (m-CNV)., METHODS: Retrospective consecutive observational series. From year 2014 to 2019, 167 eyes of 167 patients of treatment naive m-CNV were enrolled. 59 and 108 eyes were treated with intra-vitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab mono-therapy, respectively. Recurrence was defined as re-appearance of CNV activity, confirmed on optical coherence tomography (OCT) after at least 3 months of cessation of anti-VEGF therapy. Incidence of recurrence, predictors and re-treatment outcomes were studied., RESULTS: Overall, mean age and spherical equivalence (SE) was 47.95 +/- 14.72 years and -12.19 +/- 4.93 D respectively. Males constituted 50.9%. 44 eyes (26.4%) had a recurrence during a mean follow up of 16.5 +/- 12.86 months. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the risk of recurrence was 8, 26 and, 33.6% at 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively. Age (p = 0.511), gender (p = 0.218), SE (p = 0.092), anti-VEGF (p = 0.629) and baseline BCVA (p = 0.519) did not influence recurrence. Number of injections administered to control the disease in the first episode was the only significant predictor of recurrence (Cox Proportional Hazard Ratio 2.89-3.07, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.28-7.45; p = 0.005). At 12 months, eyes requiring one injection in first episode had a recurrence rate of 12% versus 45% in eyes requiring 3 or more injections in the first episode. A mean number of 1.9 additional injections per eye was needed during re-treatment. Final BCVA in the recurrence group was similar to that of non-recurrence group (0.53 +/- 0.40 versus 0.55 +/- 0.36 LogMAR; p = 0.755). Baseline BCVA (p = 0.0001) was the only predictor of final visual outcome irrespective of anti-VEGF drug (p = 0.38)., CONCLUSION: Eyes requiring greater number of injections for disease control in first episode are "at risk" of early m-CNV recurrence. However, recurrence does not adversely affect visual outcome, if treated adequately.

N2  - Refractive errors are associated with a range of pathological conditions, such as myopic maculopathy and glaucoma, and are highly heritable. Studies of missense and putative loss of function (pLOF) variants identified via whole exome sequencing (WES) offer the prospect of directly implicating potentially causative disease genes. We performed a genome-wide association study for refractive error in 51 624 unrelated adults, of European ancestry, aged 40-69 years from the UK and genotyped using WES. After testing 29 179 pLOF and 495 263 missense variants, 1 pLOF and 18 missense variants in 14 distinct genomic regions were taken forward for fine-mapping analysis. This yielded 19 putative causal variants of which 18 had a posterior inclusion probability >0.5. Of the 19 putative causal variants, 12 were novel discoveries. Specific variants were associated with a more myopic refractive error, while others were associated with a more hyperopic refractive error. Association with age of onset of spectacle wear (AOSW) was examined in an independent validation sample (38 100 early AOSW cases and 74 243 controls). Of 11 novel variants that could be tested, 8 (73%) showed evidence of association with AOSW status. This work identified COL4A4 and ATM as novel candidate genes associated with refractive error. In addition, novel putative causal variants were identified in the genes RASGEF1, ARMS2, BMP4, SIX6, GSDMA, GNGT2, ZNF652 and CRX. Despite these successes, the study also highlighted the limitations of community-based WES studies compared with high myopia case-control WES studies. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - Purpose: To identify the association between the choroidal thickness (ChT) with age and axial length (AL) under different refractive errors (REs) in Chinese adults., Methods: Swept-source optical coherence tomography was used to measure ChT in 2126 right eyes of 2126 participants. The participants were classified as having pathologic myopia (PM), high myopia without PM (HM), low myopia (LM), and nonmyopia (non-M) according to their REs and META-PM (the Meta-Analysis of Pathologic Myopia) classification criteria., Results: The mean age was 52.49 +/- 20.39 years (range, 18-93 years), and the mean RE was -5.27 +/- 5.37 diopters (D; range, -25.5 to +7.75 D). The mean average ChT was 159.25 +/- 80.75 microm and decreased in a linear relationship from non-M to PM (190.04 +/- 72.64 microm to 60.99 +/- 37.58 microm, P < 0.001). A significant decline in ChT was noted between 50 and 70 years (r = -0.302, P < 0.001) and less rapidly after the age of 70 years (r = -0.105, P = 0.024). No correlation was noted between age and ChT under 50 years (P = 0.260). A significantly higher association with AL was noted in the central fovea (betaHM = -23.92, betaLM = -23.88, betaNon-M = -18.80, all P < 0.001) and parafoveal ChT (betaHM = -22.87, betaLM = -22.31, betaNon-M = -18.61, all P < 0.001) when compared with the perifoveal region (betaHM = -19.80, betaLM = -18.29, betaNon-M = -13.95, all P < 0.001). Within each group of PM, HM, LM, and non-M, regression analysis showed that the coefficients of age and AL with different macular regions of ChT varied significantly., Conclusions: ChT was negatively correlated with age after 50 years. The thinning of the choroid was more prominent in the center and parafoveal regions as AL increased. Varied distributions of ChT decrease associated with AL and age were noted among different refractive groups.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of paravascular abnormalities (PVAs) and retinoschisis, and their associations with choroidal thickness (ChT) in young highly myopic (HM) adults., Methods: A total number of 645 eyes were included. Paravascular microfolds (PMs), paravascular cystoid spaces (PCs), paravascular lamellar holes (PLHs), and retinoschisis were detected using swept-source optical coherence tomography. Their associations with macular ChT and risk factors were analyzed., Results: PMs, PCs, and PLHs were detected in 203 (31.5%), 141 (21.9%), and 30 (4.7%) eyes, respectively. Retinoschisis was found in 50 (7.8%) eyes, 43 (86.0%) of which were located around the retinal vessels surrounding the optic disc. A decreasing trend of macular ChT (P < 0.001) was observed in the eyes with PMs only, with both PCs and PMs, and with PLHs, PCs, and PMs. After adjustments for age, sex, and axial length (AL), the presence of PCs, PLHs, or retinoschisis around the optic disc was negatively associated with macular ChT (all P < 0.05). Eyes with longer AL, incomplete posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), and myopic atrophic maculopathy (MAM) were more likely to have PCs (all P < 0.01) and retinoschisis around the optic disc (all P < 0.05)., Conclusions: PVAs were observed in approximately one third of the young HM adults in this study. The presence of PCs, PLHs, or retinoschisis around the optic disc was associated with thinner macular ChT. Eyes with longer AL, incomplete PVD, and MAM may be at risk of developing PVAs and retinoschisis around the optic disc., Translational Relevance: PCs, PLHs, and retinoschisis around the optic disc could serve as early indicators for myopia progression.

N2  - Purpose: To develop deep learning models based on color fundus photographs that can automatically grade myopic maculopathy, diagnose pathologic myopia, and identify and segment myopia-related lesions., Methods: Photographs were graded and annotated by four ophthalmologists and were then divided into a high-consistency subgroup or a low-consistency subgroup according to the consistency between the results of the graders. ResNet-50 network was used to develop the classification model, and DeepLabv3+ network was used to develop the segmentation model for lesion identification. The two models were then combined to develop the classification-and-segmentation-based co-decision model., Results: This study included 1395 color fundus photographs from 895 patients. The grading accuracy of the co-decision model was 0.9370, and the quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient was 0.9651; the co-decision model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9980 in diagnosing pathologic myopia. The photograph-level F1 values of the segmentation model identifying optic disc, peripapillary atrophy, diffuse atrophy, patchy atrophy, and macular atrophy were all >0.95; the pixel-level F1 values for segmenting optic disc and peripapillary atrophy were both >0.9; the pixel-level F1 values for segmenting diffuse atrophy, patchy atrophy, and macular atrophy were all >0.8; and the photograph-level recall/sensitivity for detecting lacquer cracks was 0.9230., Conclusions: The models could accurately and automatically grade myopic maculopathy, diagnose pathologic myopia, and identify and monitor progression of the lesions., Translational Relevance: The models can potentially help with the diagnosis, screening, and follow-up for pathologic myopic in clinical practice.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the behavior of silicone oil (SiO) at a steady equilibrium and during saccades in pseudophakic highly myopic eyes with posterior staphyloma with and without an encircling band and compare it to behavior in emmetropic eyes. The SiO-retina contact area and shear stress were calculated by computational fluid dynamics., Methods: A numerical model of an emmetropic eye and a myopic eye with and without scleral band underwent a saccade of 50degree/0.137 s. The vitreous chamber surface was divided into superior and inferior 180degree sectors: lens, pre-equator, post-equator, and macula. SiO-retina contact was evaluated as a function of fill percentages between 80% and 90% for standing, 45degree upward tilt, and supine patients. Maximum and average shear stress were calculated., Results: Overall, SiO-retina contact ranged between 40% and 83%; fill percentage varied between 80% and 95%. Neither the encircling scleral band nor the staphyloma significantly affected the SiO-retina contact area, although the presence of a scleral band proved disadvantageous when gazing 45degree upward. The inferior retina-SiO contact remained below 40% despite 95% SiO fill. The SS significantly increased at the scleral band indentation and decreased elsewhere. The staphyloma greatly reduced shear stress at the macula., Conclusions: The presence of a myopic staphyloma reduces shear stress at the macula but does not alter SiO-retina contact significantly. The apposition of a 360degree scleral band may reduce SiO-retina contact at least in some postures and increases the SS at the indentation., Translational Relevance: Assessing SiO-retina contact when vitreous chamber geometry changes according to pathologic or iatrogenic modifications allows accurate prediction of real-life tamponade behavior and helps explain surgical outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effect of vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and gas tamponade for myopic foveoschisis (MF), and analysed prognosis with different gas tamponade., METHODS: Retrospective, non-randomized study. The records of patients with MF treated by vitrectomy, were reviewed. Patients were followed up postoperatively mean 16.74 months, to record changes of Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central foveal thickness (CFT)., RESULTS: Sixty-two eyes (59 patients) were analysed in total, with mean age of 55.29 +/- 10.34 years, 49 females (83.1%). Foveoschisis completely resolved in all eyes at least 6 months post vitrectomy, except for two postoperative full-thickness macular holes (FTMH). Final BCVA improved significantly from 0.69 +/- 0.39 to 0.44 +/- 0.42 logMAR, and CFT from 502.47 +/- 164.78 to 132.67 +/- 52.26 mum. Patients were subdivided into three subgroups based on the different endotamponades used (C3F8, C2F6, and air). Baseline BCVA, baseline CFT and foveal detachment (FD) were not significantly different among the three groups. Eyes treated with air tamponade had better visual outcomes than eyes with C3F8 tamponade (P = 0.008). Baseline BCVA and FD were significant risk factors for postoperative BCVA (P < 0.001 and P = 0.013, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy with ILM peeling and gas tamponade results in good functional and anatomic outcomes in the treatment of most MF. Good vision and no-FD pre-surgery are related with good visual prognosis. Air tamponade can provide as good visual recovery as expansive gas, and reduce postoperative complications. Copyright © 2022.

N2  - Purpose: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a major cause of vision loss in patients with diabetic retinopathy; this study is aimed at comparing the expression of aquaporins (AQPs) on the inner limiting membranes (ILMs) of various vitreoretinal diseases and investigating the role of aquaporins expressed on the ILMs in mediating the occurrence of DME., Methods: The whole-mounted ILM specimens surgically excised from patients with various vitreoretinal diseases (idiopathic macular hole, myopic traction maculopathy, and diabetic retinopathy) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The distribution and morphology of AQP4, AQP7, and AQP11 on the ILMs were correlated with immunohistochemical staining characteristics. Moreover, immunofluorescence of AQP4 was performed on the ILM specimens of the patient in four groups: the control group, negative control group, no DME group, and DME group. The immunofluorescence intensity value of AQP4 was measured using ImageJ. The difference between the four groups and the correction between the immunofluorescence value and central foveal thickness (CFT) were analyzed., Results: In IHC sections, the expression of AQP4, AQP7, and AQP11 on ILMs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) with macular edema, respectively, seemed to be more abundant than in the idiopathic macular hole (iMH) and myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). Moreover, markedly higher fluorescence intensity of AQP4 of ILMs was determined in the DME group (51.05 +/- 5.67) versus the other three groups (P < 0.001). A marked positive association was identified between the fluorescence intensity of AQP4 and CFT (r = 0.758; P = 0.011)., Conclusions: AQP4, AQP7, and AQP11 can be expressed on human ILM in vivo. The increased expression of AQPs on the ILMs of DR may be associated with the occurrence of DME. Moreover, the degree of DME may be positively correlated with the expression of AQP4 on the ILMs. Copyright © 2022 Yiqi Chen et al.

N2  - PURPOSE: It is common for physicians to be uncertain when examining some images. Models trained with human uncertainty could be a help for physicians in diagnosing pathologic myopia., DESIGN: This is a hospital-based study that included 9176 images from 1327 patients that were collected between October 2015 and March 2019., METHODS: All collected images were graded by 21 myopia specialists according to the presence of myopic neovascularization (MNV), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM), and dome-shaped macula (DSM). Hard labels were made by the rule of major wins, while soft labels were possibilities calculated by whole grading results from the different graders. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics curve, the area under precision-recall (AUPR) curve, F-score, and least square errors were used to evaluate the performance of the models., RESULTS: The AUC values of models trained by soft labels in MNV, MTM, and DSM models were 0.985, 0.946, and 0.978; and the AUPR values were 0.908, 0.876, and 0.653 respectively. However, 0.56% of MNV "negative" cases were answered as "positive" with high certainty by the hard label model, whereas no case was graded with extreme errors by the soft label model. The same results were found for the MTM (0.95% vs none) and DSM (0.43% vs 0.09%) models., CONCLUSIONS: The predicted possibilities from the models trained by soft labels were close to the results made by myopia specialists. These findings could inspire the novel use of deep learning models in the medical field. Copyright © 2021 Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology.

N2  - Myopia is a worldwide major public concern, aside from the visual disturbance needing optical correction, myopia may be associated with open angle glaucoma, retinal detachment and myopic maculopathy. The higher the myopia the higher the risk for retinal associated comorbidities, and the axial length is the more important measure to estimate risk of visual impairment. Recently a formula to predict axial length using spherical equivalent and keratometry was proposed, with the intention of categorizing the risk of visual impairment with Tideman et al. classification., PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of an axial length prediction formula in a Colombian population 8-17 years old., METHODS: Children from MIOPUR study with optical biometer axial length measure (AL), manifest refraction and keratometry were included in the analysis. Predicted axial length (PAL) was calculated with the prediction formula. A Bland-Altman assessment was conducted, and the concordance correlation coefficient was measured. Proposed classification of AL to establish risk of visual loss was used with measured AL and with PAL. The percentage of eyes misclassified was then established., RESULTS: A total of 2129 eyes were included in the analysis. Mean difference of axial length (actual AL minus PAL) was -0.516mm (-1.559mm-0.528mm). Concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.656 (IC95 0.636-0.675) was found between the real AL and PAL. PAL differed from measured AL by 1mm or more in 16.58 %, and by 2mm or more, in 0.61 % of the eyes. In myopic eyes, PAL was in average 0.426mm longer than the AL actually measured with CCC of 0.714 (IC95 0.666-0.761). PAL differed from measured AL by 1mm or more in 21.92 %, and by 2mm or more, in 0.45 % of the myopic eyes. The study revealed that 15.03 % of all eyes, and 29.81 % of myopic eyes, were misclassified when PAL was used., CONCLUSIONS: The proposed axial length prediction formula was not accurate, and it did not adequately classify risk of visual impairment in myopic eyes in a group of Colombian children. We consider that it is not possible to predict the axial length based only on optometric data, such as the corneal radius of curvature and the spherical equivalent. This is very possibly related to the variability of crystalline lens power within a population. Copyright © 2021 British Contact Lens Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of posterior staphyloma identified using ultra-widefield fundus imaging on the long-term progression of myopic maculopathy in highly myopic patients., METHODS: In this observational cohort study, highly myopic patients who were followed up for at least 5 years using ultra-widefield fundus imaging were analysed for fundus abnormalities and the progression of myopic maculopathy based on the International Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia classification., RESULTS: This study included 390 eyes (210 patients) with the mean follow-up period of 69.2 +/- 7.5 months (range, 60-88). Posterior staphyloma was identified in 198 eyes (50.8%) in the baseline ultra-widefield fundus images. The border of staphyloma was not identified within 50degree view circle corresponding to conventional fundus photography in 42 eyes (21.2%) with staphyloma, most of that were wide macular type. Progression of myopic maculopathy during follow-up was observed in 202 eyes (51.8%), and eyes with staphyloma were more likely to show progression compared to those without (142/198 [71.7%] versus 60/192 [31.3%]; p < 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, the presence of posterior staphyloma was an independent risk factor for the progression of myopic maculopathy (p = 0.005). One or more peripheral retinal lesions were observed in 302 eyes (77.4%) and 321 eyes (82.3%) in the baseline and final ultra-widefield fundus images, respectively., CONCLUSION: Posterior staphyloma was associated with the long-term progression of myopic maculopathy. With a wider field of view, ultra-widefield fundus imaging is useful for identifying the posterior staphyloma and monitoring the progression of myopic maculopathy in highly myopic patients.

N2  - Ranibizumab is an FDA-approved drug used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and myopic choroidal neovascularization. Bevacizumab is another drug often used off-label to treat wet AMD. In order to reduce unwanted angiogenesis, ranibizumab and bevacizumab target circulating VEGF-A in the eye. Concentration levels in human vitreous and aqueous humor can be used to provide valuable efficacy information. However, vitreous and aqueous humor's aqueous environment, and vitreous humor's viscosity, as well as the stickiness of the analytes can provide bioanalytical challenges. In this manuscript, we describe the development, optimization, and fit-for-purpose validation of an LC-HRMS method designed for intact quantitative bioanalysis of ranibizumab and bevacizumab in human vitreous and aqueous humor following intravitreal administration. In order to fully develop this method, evaluations were conducted to optimize the conditions, including the data processing model (extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) vs deconvolution), carryover mitigation, sample preparation scheme optimization for surrogate and primary matrices, use of internal standard/immunocapture/deglycosylation, and optimization of the extraction and dilution procedure, as well as optimization of the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry conditions. Once the method was fully optimized, a fit-for-purpose validation was conducted, including matrix parallelism, with a linear calibration range of 10 to 200 microg/mL. The development of this intact quantitative method using LC-HRMS provides a proof-of-concept template for challenging, but valuable new and exciting bioanalytical techniques. Copyright © 2022.

N2  - AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the inter-observer and intra-observer agreement of the myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) staging system (MSS)., METHODS: The agreement test for MSS was based on the evaluation of 104 optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans from 104 myopic eyes. According to the MSS, six observers were asked to identify, in each image, one among four retinal patterns and one among three foveal patterns of MTM, the presence of an outer lamellar macular hole (OLMH) and an epiretinal membrane (ERM). Each observer repeated the agreement test after a 60 days interval., RESULTS: Inter-observer reliability: the agreement of the test for the retina pattern was substantial (0.724), for the fovea pattern was 0.821, for the OLMH was 0.656, and for the ERM was 0.463. When all the criteria are included in the validation test the agreement was 0.657. Regarding the weighted statistics (Gwet's AC2, 95% CI), the validation test was statistically significant both when the variables were considered one by one, with an excellent agreement, respectively for the retina pattern (0.955) and the fovea pattern (0.963) and when all the variables were included in the tests (0.930). Intra-observer repeatability: all observers rerun the test after 2 months with a statistically significant percentage of confirmation of the previous test., CONCLUSION: The MSS offers in one Table information on diagnosis, natural history, function, prognosis, and management of MTM. The MSS is user-friendly and highly reproducible.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: High myopia incidence and prevalence is increasing worldwide, and the visual burden caused by myopia is expected to rise accordingly. Studies investigating the occurrence of myopic complications in individuals of European ancestry with high myopia are scarce, hampering insights into the frequency of myopic retinal complications in European individuals and their visual burden., OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of myopic macular features in individuals of European ancestry with high myopia., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional analysis of the Dutch Myopia Study (MYST) and individuals with high myopia from the Rotterdam Study (RS) included 626 patients with high myopia (spherical equivalent of refractive error [SER] <=-6 diopters [D] or axial length [AL] >=26 mm) who underwent an extensive ophthalmic examination including multimodal retinal imaging. In addition to this combination of a population-based cohort study and mix-based high myopia study, a systematic literature review was also performed to compare findings with studies of individuals of Asian ancestry., EXPOSURES: High myopia, age, and AL., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency of myopic macular and optic disc features: tessellated fundus, myopic macular degeneration (MMD), staphyloma, peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation, peripapillary atrophy (PPA), and "plus" lesions (choroidal neovascularization, Fuchs spot, and lacquer cracks)., RESULTS: The mean (SD) SER of the combined study population (MYST and RS) was -9.9 (3.2) D; the mean (SD) age was 51.4 (15.1) years, and 387 (61.8%) were women. The prevalence of MMD was 25.9% and increased with older age (P for trend <.001), lower SER (odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65-0.76; P < .001), and higher AL (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 2.13-3.06; P < .001). Choroidal neovascularization or Fuchs spot was present in 2.7% (n = 17), both lesions in 0.3% (n = 2), and lacquer cracks in 1.4% (n = 9). Staphyloma, PPA, and MMD were highly prevalent in visual impaired and blind eyes (frequency was 73.9% [20 of 27], 90.5% [19 of 21], and 63.0% [17 of 27] of unilateral blind eyes for MMD, staphyloma, and PPA, respectively). Seven previous studies in Asian populations reported a variable MMD frequency ranging from 8.3% to 64%, but frequencies were similar for comparable risk profiles based on age and SER., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of a highly myopic Dutch population of European ancestry, myopic retinal features were frequent; were associated with age, SER, and AL; and occurred in all visually severely impaired eyes. The absence of treatment options for most of these retinal complications emphasizes the need for effective strategies to prevent high myopia.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Anti-angiogenesis therapy with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents is now the standard-of-care treatment for myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)., AREAS COVERED: We provide a critical review of the safety of all the anti-VEGF agents currently used for treating myopic CNV including ranibizumab, aflibercept, conbercept, bevacizumab, and ziv-aflibercept., EXPERT OPINION: Anti-VEGF therapy for myopic CNV with the currently available anti-VEGF drugs generally have favorable safety outcomes in the short-term. Nonetheless, ocular adverse events following anti-VEGF therapy for myopic CNV may develop and these include worsening or new development of myopic traction maculopathy, increased risk of retinal detachment, and progression of chorioretinal atrophy. Clinicians should be aware of these potential complications and evaluate them before and after anti-VEGF therapy.

N2  - Background: Myopia is one of the most common causes of vision impairment in children and adults and has become a public health priority with its growing prevalence worldwide. This study aims to identify and evaluate the global trends in myopia research of the past century and visualize the frontiers using bibliometric analysis., Methods: The literature search was conducted on the Web of Science for myopia studies published between 1900 and 2020. Retrieved publications were analyzed in-depth by the annual publication number, prolific countries and institutions, core author and journal, and the number of citations through descriptive statistics. Collaboration networks and keywords burst were visualized by VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Myopia citation network was visualized using CitNetExplorer., Results: In total, 11,172 publications on myopia were retrieved from 1900 to 2020, with most published by the United States. Saw SM, from the National University of Singapore, contributed the most publications and citations. Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science was the journal with highest number of citations. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery with the maximum number of publications. The top 10 cited papers mainly focused on the epidemiology of myopia. Previous research emphasized myopia-associated experimental animal models, while recent keywords include "SMILE" and "myopia control" with the stronger burst, indicating a shift of concern from etiology to therapy and coincided with the global increment of incidence. Document citation network was clustered into six groups: "prevalence and risk factors of myopia," "surgical control of myopia," "pathogenesis of myopia," "optical interventions of myopia," "myopia and glaucoma," and "pathological myopia.", Conclusions: Bibliometrics analysis in this study could help scholars comprehend global trends of myopia research frontiers better. Hundred years of myopia research were clustered into six groups, among which "prevalence and risk factors of myopia" and "surgical control of myopia" were the largest groups. With the increasing prevalence of myopia, interventions of myopia control are a potential research hotspot and pressing public health issue. Copyright © 2022 Shan, Dong, Chen, Su and Wan.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Pathologic myopia due to an excessive increase of axial length is associated with severe visual impairments. Systematic analyses to determine the rate of and the risk factors associated with the axial elongation in adults with high myopia based on long-term follow-up of a large population are needed., OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors associated with axial elongation in adults with high myopia., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used the medical records of 43 201 patient visits in a single-hospital database that were collected from January 3, 2011, to December 28, 2018. A total of 15 745 medical records with the patients' sex, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), axial length, type of myopic maculopathy, and the presence or absence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) were reviewed. Data were analyzed from April 3, 2019, to August 5, 2020., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in the axial length at each examination were calculated. The significance of the associations between the annual increase of the axial length and age, sex, baseline axial length, types of myopic maculopathy, and a history of CNV was determined. Generalized linear mixed models were used to evaluate the strength of the risk factors associated with an increase of the axial length in high myopia., RESULTS: Among 1877 patients with 9161 visits included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 62.10 (12.92) years, and 1357 (72.30%) were women. The mean (SD) axial length was 29.66 (2.20) mm with a mean (SD) growth rate of 0.05 (0.24) mm/y. Among the 9161 visits, 7096 eyes (77.46%) had myopic maculopathy and 2477 eyes (27.04%) had CNV. The odds ratio for inducing a severe elongation of the axial length was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.38-1.55) for female sex, 0.44 (95% CI, 0.35-0.56) to 0.63 (95% CI, 13 0.50-0.78) for older than 40 years, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.15-1.54) for BCVA of less than 20/400, 1.67 (95% CI, 1.54-1.81) to 2.67 (95% CI, 2.46-2.88) for baseline axial length of 28.15 mm or greater, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.96-1.17) to 1.39 (95% CI, 1.24-1.55) for the presence of maculopathy, and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.29-1.47) for prior CNV., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found continuing axial elongation in adults with high myopia. The risk factors for elongation do not appear to be modifiable, so prevention of myopia may be the best approach to reduce the incidence of pathologic myopia and its complications in the future.

N2  - PURPOSE: To report the 24-month outcomes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in predominantly Caucasian eyes in routine clinical practice., METHODS: Retrospective analysis of treatment-naive eyes starting intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors of either bevacizumab (1.25 mg) or ranibizumab (0.5 mg) for mCNV from 1 January 2006 to 31 May 2018 that were tracked in the Fight Retinal Blindness! registry., RESULTS: We identified 203 eyes (bevacizumab-85 and ranibizumab-118) of 189 patients. The estimated mean (95% CI) change in VA over 24 months for all eyes using longitudinal models was +8 (5, 11) letters with a median (Q1, Q3) of 3 (2, 5) injections given mostly during the first year. The estimated mean change in VA at 24 months was similar between bevacizumab and ranibizumab [+9 (5, 13) letters for bevacizumab versus +9 (6, 13) letters for ranibizumab; p = 0.37]. Both agents were also similar in the mCNV activity outcomes, treatment frequency and visit frequency., CONCLUSIONS: The 24-month treatment outcomes of VEGF inhibitors for mCNV were favourable in this largest series yet reported of predominantly Caucasian eyes in routine clinical practice, with approximately two lines of visual gain and a median of three injections given mostly during the first year. These outcomes are similar to those reported for predominantly Asian eyes. Bevacizumab appeared to be as safe and effective as ranibizumab. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - To investigate optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) biomarkers for good visual outcomes in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) following anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. Patients diagnosed with mCNV via multimodal imaging were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographic data and biomarkers were collected. Anti-VEGF treatment based on a pro re nata (PRN) regimen was conducted on all eyes. The visual gains of >= 15 ETDRS letters or < 15 letters at 12-month were classified into two groups. Regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with significant best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement. Among 34 patients, 17 eyes and 17 eyes were classified into the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in qualitative OCTA biomarkers between the two groups. The >= 15 letters group had significantly thicker subfoveal choroid thickness (SFCT) (79.97 +/- 33.15 vs. 50.66 +/- 18.31, P = 0.003), more ellipsoid zone integrity (58.8% vs. 23.5%, P = 0.037) and lower levels of fractal dimension (1.45 +/- 0.101 vs. 1.53 +/- 0.082, P = 0.031) than the < 15 letters group. SFCT and the ellipsoid zone integrity were correlated with 15 letters or more VA improvement in both univariable and multivariable analyses (P = 0.023 and P = 0.044, respectively). Thicker SFCT and integrity of the ellipsoid zone at baseline were associated with greater visual gains at 12 months. OCTA biomarkers seem to play a less important role in predicting the visual outcome of mCNV. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

N2  - Cone photoreceptor dysfunction represents a clinically heterogenous group of disorders characterized by nystagmus, photophobia, reduced central or color vision, and macular dystrophy. Here, we described the molecular findings and clinical manifestations of achromatopsia, a partial or total absence of color vision, co-segregating with three known missense variants of CNGA3 in three large consanguineous Pakistani families. Fundus examination and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging revealed myopia, thin retina, retinal pigment epithelial cells loss at fovea/perifovea, and macular atrophy. Combination of Sanger and whole exome sequencing revealed three known homozygous missense variants (c.827A>G, p.(Asn276Ser); c.847C>T, p.(Arg283Trp); c.1279C>T, p.(Arg427Cys)) in CNGA3, the alpha-subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel in cone photoreceptor cells. All three variants are predicted to replace evolutionary conserved amino acids, and to be pathogenic by specific in silico programs, consistent with the observed altered membrane targeting of CNGA3 in heterologous cells. Insights from our study will facilitate counseling regarding the molecular and phenotypic landscape of CNGA3-related cone dystrophies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the long-term surgical outcomes and prognostic factors of foveal detachment (FD) in pathological myopia., METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 59 patients with FD (61 eyes) who underwent pars plana vitrectomy at Shanghai General Hospital between June 2017 and July 2018 with follow-up for at least 24 months. Comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and swept-source optical coherence tomography, were assessed. Preoperative myopic maculopathy was evaluated according to the ATN classification., RESULTS: FD completely resolved in 59 of 61 eyes (96.7%). Mean duration of retinal reattachment was 12.10 +/- 8.10 months. Mean logMAR BCVA improved from 1.34 +/- 0.52 to 0.83 +/- 0.43 at 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.001). Secondary macular hole occurred in 8 eyes (13.1%) with a mean period of 3.4 +/- 4.1 weeks after primary surgery. In regression analyses, baseline myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM) (B = 0.213, P = 0.005) and vitreomacular traction (VMT) (B = 0.292, P = 0.007) were adverse prognostic factors for postoperative BCVA. A more severe MAM revealed a delay in retinal reattachment (B = 5.670, P = 0.002). FD eyes with VMT (OR = 1.309, P = 0.003) or outer lamellar macular hole (O-LMH) (OR = 1.369, P < 0.001) were risk factors for postoperative secondary macular hole., CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy was effective in the long-term for treating FD. Careful consideration is needed for those with VMT or O-LMH due to the high risk of secondary macular hole after vitrectomy. FD eyes with more severe MAM tended to have poorer postoperative BCVA and extended periods of retinal reattachment. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to establish and validate optical coherence tomography (OCT) based diagnostic criteria of high myopia., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study including 100 eyes of high myopia with axial length larger than 26.5 mm and 100 control eyes, which were examined by spectral-domain OCT. Vertical and horizontal OCT of 9 mm scanning across fovea were analyzed. OCT characteristics including mirror artifact, scleral sink due to steep inclination of posterior sclera, scleral visibility, abnormality of outer retinal layer, foveoschisis, and dome-shaped macula were assessed in each group., RESULTS: The mean axial length was 28.65 +/- 2.07 mm (range, 26.51-34.59 mm) in high myopia group and 23.79 +/- 0.99 mm (range, 21.26-25.94 mm) in control group. Among the OCT characteristics noted at high frequency in the eyes with high myopia, three criteria achieving high sensitivity and specificity were determined: scleral sink over 500 mum, scleral visibility over 100 mum, and dome-shaped macula. Under conditions of presence of any of three criteria in either horizontal or vertical OCT scanning, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for high myopia were found to be 95.0%, 98.0%, 98.0%, and 95.1%, respectively. In a new set of OCT images from 50 eyes with high myopia and 50 eyes of nonhigh myopia cases, the OCT-based criteria also proved similar level of diagnostic validity., CONCLUSIONS: The OCT-based criteria, which directly addressed posterior scleral contour changes, may lead to an intuitive and accurate diagnosis of high myopia. Also, the criteria may contribute to early detection and monitoring of eyes that cannot be defined as high myopia but can progress. OCT may be useful for monitoring high myopia patients as OCT can detect myopia-associated retinal pathologies as well as scleral contour changes.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To apply deep learning technology to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can identify vision-threatening conditions in high myopia patients based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) macular images., METHODS: In this cross-sectional, prospective study, a total of 5505 qualified OCT macular images obtained from 1048 high myopia patients admitted to Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre (ZOC) from 2012 to 2017 were selected for the development of the AI system. The independent test dataset included 412 images obtained from 91 high myopia patients recruited at ZOC from January 2019 to May 2019. We adopted the InceptionResnetV2 architecture to train four independent convolutional neural network (CNN) models to identify the following four vision-threatening conditions in high myopia: retinoschisis, macular hole, retinal detachment and pathological myopic choroidal neovascularisation. Focal Loss was used to address class imbalance, and optimal operating thresholds were determined according to the Youden Index., RESULTS: In the independent test dataset, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were high for all conditions (0.961 to 0.999). Our AI system achieved sensitivities equal to or even better than those of retina specialists as well as high specificities (greater than 90%). Moreover, our AI system provided a transparent and interpretable diagnosis with heatmaps., CONCLUSIONS: We used OCT macular images for the development of CNN models to identify vision-threatening conditions in high myopia patients. Our models achieved reliable sensitivities and high specificities, comparable to those of retina specialists and may be applied for large-scale high myopia screening and patient follow-up.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The objective is to examine the clinical characteristics of three patients with macular hole that occurred in inferior posterior staphyloma associated with tilted disc syndrome., CASE PRESENTATIONS: This study involved three eyes of three Japanese female patients (mean age 76.0 years, range 73-84 years) with macular hole occurring in inferior posterior staphyloma associated with tilted disc syndrome. One of the three eyes was slightly myopic, while the other two eyes were highly myopic. In all three eyes, the macular hole was found to be located in or near the margin of the inferior posterior staphyloma. In one eye, the extent of retinoschisis was rather broad in the margin of the macular hole, and another eye had a history of treatment for choroidal neovascularization. As surgical treatment, the internal limiting membrane in areas surrounding the macular hole was detached after producing artificial posterior vitreous detachment, and a gas tamponade was performed. It was found during surgery that the extensibility of the retina in the margin of the MH was decreased in the three eyes as compared with a usual macular hole. Although the macular hole was successfully closed in all three cases post surgery, the layer structure of the central retina was poorly repaired in all three cases and choroidal neovascularization remained in one case. In all three cases, corrected visual acuity remained at 0.3-0.5 post surgery., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed poor improvement of visual acuity in all three cases post surgery, even if closure of the macular hole is achieved, thus suggesting that in cases of macular hole associated with tilted disc syndrome and inferior posterior staphyloma, the presence of macular dysfunction existing prior to the onset of macular hole affects visual prognosis.

N2  - Background: Myopic macular degeneration (MMD) is a primary cause of blindness and visual impairment in many parts of the world. A review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for intervention selection are required with the increasing demand for MMD management in clinical practice as well as in national health services. Therefore, we aim to systematically review CPGs for MMD and assist the recommendations development of the Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI) program of the World Health Organization., Methods: A systematic review of CPGs published on MMD between 2010 and April 2020 was conducted. Guidelines were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. Cochrane systematic reviews were also included when the evidence from included CPGs were inadequate or contradict., Results: After applying exclusion criteria and conducting the quality appraisal, two CPGs were finally included. The average of the AGREE II ratings for the identified Guidelines were 56 and 63 respectively (7 for each item). To provide further information on interventions for MMD, one Cochrane review on MMD was additionally identified and included in the study. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs were recommended for patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) as first-line therapy to improve vision and reduce central macular thickness, and ranibizumab showed significant effectiveness compared to photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT was recommended to be performed in those resistant to the treatment by one CPG but lacked of adequate description and support. Data extracted from the Cochrane systematic reviews indicated that anti-VEGF therapy for mCNV had significant effectiveness in improving visual acuity and reducing CMT compared to PDT with moderate to low certainty of evidence. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab were considered as equally effective with moderate certainty., Conclusions: The outcomes of this review suggest that high quality clinical practice guidelines for MMD management are limited. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents was recommended as an effective intervention to treat myopic CNV as the first-line treatment, while there was inadequate guidance for the application of PDT in myopic CNV management. The use of other interventions for MMD were not recommended at this time and additional evidence is called for. Copyright © 2022 by the Journal of Global Health. All rights reserved.

T1  - What colour are your eyes? Teaching the genetics of eye colour & colour vision. Edridge Green Lecture RCOphth Annual Congress Glasgow May 2019.

N2  - Eye colour and colour perception are excellent examples to use when teaching genetics as they encompass not simply the basic Mendelian genetics of dominant, recessive and X-linked disorders, but also many of the new concepts such as non-allelic diseases, polygenic disease, phenocopies, genome-wide association study (GWAS), founder effects, gene-environment interaction, evolutionary drivers for variations, copy number variation, insertions deletions, methylation and gene inactivation. Beyond genetics, colour perception touches on concepts involving optics, physics, physiology and psychology and can capture the imagination of the population, as we saw with social media trend of "#the dress". Television shows such as Game of Thrones focused attention on the eye colour of characters, as well as their Dire-wolves and Dragons. These themes in popular culture can be leveraged as tools to teach and engage everyone in genetics, which is now a key component in all eye diseases. As the explosion of data from genomics, big data and artificial intelligence transforms medicine, ophthalmologists need to be genetically literate. Genetics is relevant, not just for Inherited Retinal Diseases and congenital abnormalities but also for the leading causes of blindness: age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, myopia, diabetic retinopathy and cataract. Genetics should be part of the armamentarium of every practicing ophthalmologist. We need to ask every patient about their family history. In the near future, patients will attend eye clinics with genetic results showing they are at high risk of certain eye diseases and ophthalmologists will need to know how to screen, follow and treat these patients.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the 5-year cumulative incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy in the general population in Germany and to analyze potential risk factors., DESIGN: The Gutenberg Health Study (GHS) is a population-based cohort study including 15 010 participants aged 35 to 74 years at baseline., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 494 eyes of 323 participants (mean age, 50.2 +/- 9.2 years; median, -7.25 diopters [D] myopic refractive error) without myopic maculopathy at baseline and 34 eyes of 27 subjects (mean age, 56.7 +/- 9.1 years; median, -8.75 D myopic refractive error) with myopic maculopathy met the inclusion conditions, phakic eyes with spherical equivalent <=-6 D (baseline), and had gradable fundus photographs at baseline and 5-year follow-up., METHODS: Myopic maculopathy incidence and progression were assessed by grading of fundus photographs according to a recent international photographic classification system (META-PM). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for progression of myopic maculopathy., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimates for incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy., RESULTS: The 5-year cumulative incidence of myopic maculopathy was 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-1.99; n = 1). Progression occurred in 17 of 34 eyes (50%) with prior myopic maculopathy over 5 years with 4 changes in category. The most common types of progression were enlargement of diffuse and patchy chorioretinal atrophy; a new pathology was present in 8 eyes. Higher intraocular pressure (IOP) (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.51-1.59; P = 0.035) was associated with progression of myopic maculopathy. Female gender (OR, 5.54; 95% CI, 0.93-32.92; P = 0.060) and higher myopic refractive error (OR, 1.62 per diopter; 95% CI, 0.99-1.49; P = 0.063) showed a tendency toward progression., CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of myopic maculopathy is rare in highly myopic eyes in the general population aged 35 to 74 years in Germany. Progression of myopic maculopathy in the German population occurred in 50% of highly myopic eyes. We presented population-based 5-year follow-up data on incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy in Europe. Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the application of a modified Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) surgical implantation technique in vitrectomized eyes, in order to minimize the risk of early postoperative hypotony, which leads to hemorrhagic complications., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of patients implanted with AGV using the surgical technique described were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criterion: glaucomatous eyes with previous history of pars plana vitrectomy. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement and ophthalmic examination were performed preoperatively and postoperatively weekly for 1 month for the detection of early hypotony, choroidal effusion/detachment, intraocular hemorrhage. The surgical technique consisted in creating a 5 mm long scleral tunnel with a 23 G needle reaching the anterior chamber at the iridocorneal angle, in which the Ahmed glaucoma valve tube was inserted., RESULTS: Ten eyes of 10 patients were included. Median preoperative IOP was 30.5 mmHg [interquartile range (IQR) 28.3-33.0]; median postoperative IOP was 12.0 mmHg (IQR 9.3-13.0) at 1 week, and 12.5 mmHg (IQR 11.0-15.0) at 1 month. In no cases postoperative IOP was <8 mmHg. On the first postoperative day, five (50%) eyes showed few blood clots in the anterior chamber. On the second-week appointment, moderate choroidal effusion was observed in two eyes (20%). No hemorrhagic complications were observed., CONCLUSIONS: The creation of a long intrascleral tunnel with a 23 G needle for AGV implantation in vitrectomized eyes could be effective in decreasing leakage through the space between the valve tube and the sclerocorneal tissue. This technique is safe, easy to perform, feasible and fast. Due to its advantages and good postoperative results, it could also be adopted in non-vitrectomized eyes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To analyse the feasibility and efficacy of a novel autologous plasma rich in growth factor (PRGF) preparation as adjuvant to pars plana vitrectomy and internal limiting membrane peel in high myopic full-thickness macular hole (FTMH)., METHODS: Single-centre, single-surgeon retrospective chart review of consecutive patients with high myopic FTMH who underwent surgery with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Patients were divided in group 1 (naive) and group 2 (persistent). Quantitative and qualitative variables were analysed, compared among groups and correlated with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)., RESULTS: Postoperatively, FTMH resolved in 28/31 eyes in group 1 (90%) and in 10/11 eyes in group 2 (91%), without significant differences (p = 0.954). None of the preoperative anatomical variables analysed showed significant association with preoperative BCVA. Intraoperatively, no significant complications were registered. Postoperatively, BCVA improved significantly in the studied population (p < 0.001). Preoperative factors associated with better postoperative BCVA were the presence of intraretinal cystoid spaces (p = 0.028) and elevated FTMH borders (p = 0.005). Preoperative dome-shaped macula was associated with significantly worse postoperative BCVA (p = 0.049)., CONCLUSION: The use of PRGF as adjuvant to vitrectomy showed to be reproducible, straightforward and efficient, with primary anatomical success rate comparable to other surgical approaches and lower risk of complications.

N2  - PURPOSE: Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is a major diagnostic modality but the clinical implications of specific staining patterns in active myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) are unclear. We examined the associations of ICGA cyanofluorescence patterns with disease characteristics and response to an as-needed intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) treatment regimen among active mCNV patients., METHODS: Twenty-four subjects with active mCNV treated by IVR were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Information from medical records were reviewed, including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiography (FA) findings, ICGA cyanofluorescence patterns, and spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) results. The CNV lesion size, CNV thickness, and central retinal thickness (CRT) were measured from these images., RESULTS: Two staining patterns were identified on late-phase ICGA images, hypercyanescence (9/24, 37.5%) and non-hypercyanescence (15/24, 62.5%). There were no differences in baseline BCVA, CNV thickness, and CRT between ICGA pattern groups; however, the hypercyanescence group demonstrated a larger CNV lesion size (p = 0.035) and required more IVR injections than the non-hypercyanescence group (2.67 +/- 1.58 vs 1.07 +/- 0.27, p = 0.016), while the non-hypercyanescence group demonstrated better final BCVA improvement (p = 0.041). Hypercyanescence could be divided into two types, a uniform type and rim type. A pseudopodia-like protrusion of CNV enlargement with a rim-enhanced type hypercyanescence at the protrusion rim was predictive of required retreatment., CONCLUSIONS: Hypercyanescence on late-phase ICGA may assist in identifying more active mCNV requiring intensive treatment.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of multifocal choroiditis/punctate inner choroidopathy (MFC/PIC) in eyes with patchy atrophy because of pathologic myopia., METHODS: Five hundred eyes of 253 patients with patchy atrophy were examined between 2014 and 2020 at the Advanced Clinical Center for Myopia. The main outcome measures included the prevalence and characteristics of active MFC/PIC lesions diagnosed by optical coherence tomography., RESULTS: Fifty-five of the 500 eyes (11%) diagnosed with patchy atrophy had optical coherence tomography features of active MFC/PIC lesions, such as focal elevations of the retinal pigment epithelium filled with medium hyperreflectivity material, curvilinear scars (Schlaegel lines), and/or areas of outer retinal atrophy. At the time when the MFC/PIC was diagnosed, the mean age was 57.3 +/- 12.0 years, and the mean axial length was 29.2 +/- 1.8 mm. Macular neovascularization was found in 45 of eyes (81.8%) with MFC/PIC versus 151 eyes without such findings (33.9%; P < 0.001). In 25 of the 55 eyes (45.5%), active MFC/PIC lesions were found before the development of the patchy atrophy. The Bruch membrane defects were colocated with these lesions., CONCLUSION: Active MFC/PIC lesions were identified in a minority of eyes with pathologic myopia, and a subset of these lesions were observed to progress to findings indistinguishable from myopic patchy atrophy. Evidence of MFC/PIC in eyes with pathologic myopia appeared to be a risk factor for the development of macular neovascularization.

N2  - AIM: To prospectively determine the impact of choroidal thickness (CT) on the myopic maculopathy progression., METHODS: This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational study. In total, 434 participants aged 7-70 years with bilateral high myopia (<=-6 D spherical error, range, -6 to -27.0 D) completed follow-up visits for 2 years. The baseline CT centred on the fovea was measured using a swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT). Myopic maculopathy progression was determined by fundus photography. Logistic model was used to examine the impact of CT at baseline on the myopic maculopathy progression. Likelihood ratio test was adopted for model comparison., RESULTS: The mean baseline age, spherical equivalence and subfoveal CT (SFCT) of the participants were 23.2+/-12.5 years, -10.50+/-3.18 D and 153.20+/-72.76 mum, respectively. Over 2-year's follow-up, 74 of 434 eyes (17.1%) had myopic maculopathy progression. Baseline SFCT was thinner in eyes with myopic maculopathy progression than those without (67.26+/-37.67 mum vs 170.95+/-65.45 mum; mean difference, 99.31 mum; 95% CI 83.61 to 115.01 mum; p<0.001). The same patterns of differences were observed in 7-18 years, 19-39 years and 40-70 years. In multivariate logistic regression model, SFCT was a significant risk factor (adjusted OR=0.97, p<0.005) when age, gender, axial length and baseline myopic maculopathy category were adjusted for. The addition of SFCT significantly improved the predictive discrimination of myopic maculopathy progression in comparison with that included established risk factors alone (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.899 vs 0.942, p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: CT is an independent predictor for myopic maculopathy progression.

N2  - Therapeutic inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) action has emerged as a potential approach for managing several diseases, including myopia. Herein, we analyzed the role of HIF-1alpha in the progression of pathologic myopia by regulating the miR-150-5p/LAMA4/p38 MAPK axis. Microarray-based gene expression profiling of pathologic myopia was employed to identify differentially expressed genes. Human scleral fibroblasts (HSFs) were cultured under the hypoxic conditions. Interaction among HIF-1alpha, miR-150-5p, and LAMA4 was identified. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed in hypoxia-exposed HSFs to evaluate the effect of the HIF-1alpha/miR-150-5p/LAMA4/p38 MAPK axis on the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation of HSFs and the subsequent pathologic myopia progression. Increased LAMA4 but decreased miR-150-5p was found in serum sample of pathologic myopia patients. HIF-1alpha and LAMA4 were abundantly expressed, and p38 MAPK was activated while miR-150-5p was weakly expressed in hypoxia-exposed HSFs. HIF-1alpha was enriched in the promoter region of miR-150-5p and downregulated its expression, thus repressing the ECM degradation of HSFs as shown by increased COL1A1 and TIMP-2 and reduced MMP2. In addition, LAMA4 was a downstream target of miR-150-5p and under the negative regulation by miR-150-5p. Overexpression of miR-150-5p promoted the ECM degradation of HSFs by inhibiting LAMA4 expression and p38 MAPK signaling pathway. However, upregulation of LAMA4 reversed the promoting effect of miR-150-5p on ECM degradation of HSFs. Overall, our findings suggest that HIF-1alpha can decline miR-150-5p expression and facilitate LAMA4-mediated p38 MAPK signaling pathway activation, thus arresting ECM degradation of HSFs and eventually inducing pathologic myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine whether eyes with pathologic myopia can be identified and whether each type of myopic maculopathy lesion on fundus photographs can be diagnosed by deep learning (DL) algorithms., DESIGN: A DL algorithm was developed to recognize myopic maculopathy features and to categorize the myopic maculopathy automatically., PARTICIPANTS: We examined 7020 fundus images from 4432 highly myopic eyes obtained from the Advanced Clinical Center for Myopia., METHODS: Deep learning (DL) algorithms were developed to recognize the key features of myopic maculopathy with 5176 fundus images. These algorithms were also used to develop a Meta-analysis for Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) study categorizing system (CS) by adding a specific processing layer. Models and the system were evaluated by 1844 fundus image. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were used to determine the performance of each DL algorithm. The rate of correct predictions was used to determine the performance of the META-PM study CS., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Four trained DL models were able to recognize the lesions of myopic maculopathy accurately with high sensitivity and specificity. The META-PM study CS also showed a high accuracy and was qualified to be used in a semiautomated way during screening for myopic maculopathy in highly myopic eyes., RESULTS: The sensitivity of the DL models was 84.44% for diffuse atrophy, 87.22% for patchy atrophy, 85.10% for macular atrophy, and 37.07% for choroidal neovascularization, and the AUC values were 0.970, 0.978, 0.982, and 0.881, respectively. The rate of total correct predictions from the META-PM study CS was 87.53%, with rates of 90.18%, 95.28%, 97.50%, and 91.14%, respectively, for each type of lesion. The META-PM study CS showed an overall rate of 92.08% in detecting pathologic myopia correctly, which was defined as having myopic maculopathy equal to or more serious than diffuse atrophy., CONCLUSIONS: The novel DL models and system can achieve high sensitivity and specificity in identifying the different types of lesions of myopic maculopathy. These results will assist in the screening for pathologic myopia and subsequent protection of patients against low vision and blindness caused by myopic maculopathy.

N2  - The involvement of the choroid in ocular growth regulation has been postulated in studies showing that refractive errors correlate with alterations in choroidal thickness (ChT). The advent of optical coherence tomography imaging has enabled qualitative and quantitative assessment of the choroid. In children, ChT changes correlate with a number of ocular pathologies, including myopia, retinopathy of prematurity, and amblyopia. We synthesize mechanisms and evidence regarding choroidal thickness variation during childhood. Subfoveal ChT is influenced by a number of factors including age, ethnicity, gender, axial length, and intraocular pressure. Myopic eyes have thinner choroids compared to emmetropic and hyperopic eyes. ChT may in fact serve as a marker of myopic progression, as ChT thinning occurs early during myopic development, but this association has not been established quantitatively. In addition, subfoveal ChT appears thicker in amblyopic eyes, while prematurity and retinopathy of prematurity may be associated with thinner ChT. Overall, both animal models and clinical research indicate that ChT induces or reflects physiological changes in the eye pertaining to ocular growth or maturation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To develop a deep learning system for automated glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) detection using ultra-widefield fundus (UWF) images., METHODS: We trained, validated and externally evaluated a deep learning system for GON detection based on 22 972 UWF images from 10 590 subjects that were collected at 4 different institutions in China and Japan. The InceptionResNetV2 neural network architecture was used to develop the system. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity were used to assess the performance of detecting GON by the system. The data set from the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) was selected to compare the performance of the system to that of ophthalmologists who mainly conducted UWF image analysis in clinics., RESULTS: The system for GON detection achieved AUCs of 0.983-0.999 with sensitivities of 97.5-98.2% and specificities of 94.3-98.4% in four independent data sets. The most common reasons for false-negative results were confounding optic disc characteristics caused by high myopia or pathological myopia (n=39 (53%)). The leading cause for false-positive results was having other fundus lesions (n=401 (96%)). The performance of the system in the ZOC data set was comparable to that of an experienced ophthalmologist (p>0.05)., CONCLUSION: Our deep learning system can accurately detect GON from UWF images in an automated fashion. It may be used as a screening tool to improve the accessibility of screening and promote the early diagnosis and management of glaucoma. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the relationship between an oval optic disc and the occurrence of myopic foveoschisis (MF) using swept-source optic coherence tomography (SS-OCT)., METHODS: Fifty eyes of 25 patients with unilateral MF were included in this retrospective observational study. The biometric features of the optic disc and peripapillary structures were evaluated using SS-OCT., RESULTS: The ovality index (OI) of the optic disc was significantly smaller (P = 0.003) and the optic disc tilt angle was greater (P = 0.023) in the eyes with MF than in the contralateral eyes. The optic disc tilt angle was significantly correlated with the OI (P = 0.000). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model (linear regression) demonstrated that spherical equivalent refraction (P = 0.001), narrow macular staphyloma (P = 0.001) and the occurrence of MF (P = 0.026) were the independent factors associated with the OI. Narrow macular staphyloma was more frequent (P = 0.020) and the staphyloma was deeper (P = 0.006) in eyes with MF. GEE model (logistic regression) revealed that narrow macular staphyloma was the only independent factor related to the occurrence of MF (P = 0.013)., CONCLUSIONS: An oval optic disc in eyes with MF resulted from the increased tilt around the vertical disc axis. The optic disc tilt was related to narrow macular staphyloma, which was the only independent factor associated with the occurrence of MF. The clinical relevance needs further exploration through longitudinal analysis. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE: This study had three aims: (1) correlate axial length (AL), age and best-corrected visual acuity in high myopic patients scored on the ATN grading system; (2) determine AL cut-off values to distinguish between pathologic myopia (PM) and severe PM; and (3) identify clinical differences between PM and severe PM., METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, non-interventional study. All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examination, ATN grading and multimodal imaging (colour fundus photography, swept-source OCT, fundus autofluorescence, OCT angiography and fluorescein angiography)., RESULTS: Six hundred forty-four eyes from 345 high myopic patients were included. The eyes were graded on the ATN system and classified as PM (>= A2) or severe PM (>= A3, >= T3 and/or N2). Significant between-group (PM vs. severe PM) differences (p < 0.05) were observed on the individual ATN components (atrophic [A], tractional [T] and neovascular [N]), age, BCVA and AL. AL was also linearly correlated with the A, T and N components (r = 0.53, p < 0.01; r = 0.24, p < 0.01; r = 0.20, p < 0.01; respectively). ROC curve analysis showed the optimal AL cut-off value to distinguish between PM at 28 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.813, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 75%) and severe PM at 29.50 mm (AUC ROC curve: 0.760, specificity: 75%, sensitivity: 70%)., CONCLUSION: AL is the main variable associated with myopic maculopathy. Due to the clinical differences found between PM and severe PM, there is need to create an objective cut-off point to distinguish these two different entities being the optimal cut-off points for AL 28 mm and 29.5 mm, respectively. These objective AL cut-off values should be taken into account for determining a correct follow-up, ophthalmic management and treatment. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Myopia is the most prevalent ocular disorder in the world, and corneal parameters have been regarded as key ocular biometric parameters determining the refractive status. Here, we aimed to determine the association of genome-wide association study-identified corneal curvature (CC)-related gene variants with different severity of myopia and ocular biometric parameters in Chinese population., METHODS: Total 2,101 unrelated Han Chinese subjects were recruited, including 1,649 myopia and 452 control subjects. Five previously reported CC-associated gene variants (PDGFRA, MTOR, WNT7B, CMPK1 and RBP3) were genotyped by TaqMan assay, and their association with different myopia severity and ocular biometric parameters were evaluated., RESULTS: Joint additive effect analysis showed that MTOR rs74225573 paired with PDGFRA rs2114039 (P = .009, odds ratio (OR) = 4.91) or CMPK1 rs17103186 (P = .002, OR = 13.03) were significantly associated with higher risk in mild myopia. Critically, mild myopia subjects had significantly higher frequency in MTOR rs74225573 C allele than high myopia subjects (P = .003), especially in male subjects (P = .001, OR = 0.49). High myopia subjects carrying MTOR rs74225573 C allele have significant flatter CC (P = .035) and longer corneal radius (P = .044) than those carrying TT genotype., CONCLUSION: This study revealed that male high myopia subjects are more prone to carry CC-related MTOR rs74225573 T allele, whereas mild myopia subjects are prone to carry the C allele. MTOR rs7422573 variant could be a genetic marker to differentiate mild from high myopia in risk assessment., ABBREVIATIONS: ACD: anterior chamber depth; AL: axial length; AL/CR: axial length/corneal radius ratio; ANOVA: analysis of variance; CC: corneal curvature; CCT: central corneal thickness; C.I.: confidence interval; CMPK1: cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 1; CR: corneal radius; D: diopter; GWAS: genome-wide association studies; HWE: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; LT: lens thickness; MIPEP: mitochondrial intermediate peptidase; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; OR: odds ratio; PDGFRA: platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha; RBP3: retinol-binding protein 3; SD: standard deviation; SE: spherical equivalence; SNTB1: syntrophin beta 1; VCD: vitreous chamber depth; VIPR2: vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2; WNT7B: wingless/integrated family member 7B.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to engineer deep learning (DL) models that can identify myopic maculopathy in patients with high myopia based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images., Methods: An artificial intelligence (AI) system was developed using 2342 qualified OCT macular images from 1041 patients with pathologic myopia admitted to the Affiliated Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (WMU). We adopted an ResNeSt101 architecture to train five independent models to identify the following five myopic maculopathies: macular choroidal thinning, macular Bruch membrane (BM) defects, subretinal hyper-reflective material (SHRM), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM), and dome-shaped macula (DSM). We tested the models with an independent test dataset that included 450 images obtained from 297 patients with high myopia. Focal loss was used to address class imbalance, and optimal operating thresholds were determined according to the Youden Index. The performance was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and confusion matrix., Results: For the identification of myopic maculopathy, the AUCs of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.927 to 0.974 for 5 myopic maculopathies. Our AI system achieved sensitivities equal to or even better than those of junior retinal specialists (56.16-99.73%). The diagnosis of it is also interpretable that we provide visual explanations clearly via heatmaps., Conclusions: We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL AI system for detection and classification of myopic maculopathy in patients with high myopia using OCT macular images. Our AI system achieved sensitivities equal to or even better than those of junior retinal specialists., Translational Relevance: This AI system can be widely applied in sophisticated situations in large-scale high myopia screening.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate morphologic features along posterior staphyloma edges in eyes with pathologic myopia using ultra-widefield optical coherence tomography imaging., METHODS: Highly myopic patients (refractive error < -8 diopters or axial length >=26.5 mm) were consecutively examined by prototype ultra-widefield optical coherence tomography with a scan width of 23 mm and depth of 5 mm. Staphyloma edges were assessed for scleral, choroidal, and retinal status, as well as measurements of angle size. Findings were correlated with pigmentary changes observed on Optos fundus photography, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed., RESULTS: In 164 eyes diagnosed with posterior staphyloma by ultra-widefield optical coherence tomography, choroidal thinning and scleral protrusion were hallmark features of staphyloma edges, observed simultaneously in more than 95% of staphylomatous eyes. Outer neural retinal thinning was observed in 80 eyes (48.8%), whereas 15 eyes (9.1%) showed retinal pigment epithelium damage. The mean angle at the staphyloma edge was 23degree +/- 12.4degree (range 8degree to 77degree). Larger angles were significant predictors of retinal thinning (adjusted odds ratio: 1.17, confidence interval: 1.09-1.25), and the staphyloma was detected by Optos pseudocolor fundus photography (adjusted odds ratio: 1.08, confidence interval: 1.02-1.15)., CONCLUSION: These morphologic findings may provide a basis for exploring the natural evolution of posterior staphyloma as part of the development of pathologic myopia.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the annual incidences and rates of progression of myopia and high myopia in Chinese schoolchildren from grade 1 to grade 6 and explore the possible cause-specific risk factors for myopia., Methods: From 11 randomly selected primary schools in Anyang city, central China, 2835 grade 1 students were examined with annual follow ups for 5 years. Students were invited to undergo a comprehensive examination, including cycloplegic autorefraction, ocular biometry, and standardized questionnaires., Results: The mean spherical equivalent refraction decreased substantially from +0.94 +/- 1.03 diopter (D) in grade 1 to -1.37 +/- 2.08 D in grade 6, with rapid annual myopic shifts, especially for students in grades 3 through 6 (-0.51 to -0.59 D). The prevalence of myopia increased substantially, with the yearly incidence of myopia increasing from 7.8% in grade 1 and 2 to 25.3% in grades 5 and 6, and the incidence of high myopia increased from 0.1% to 1.0%. The 5-year incidence of myopia was lowest among children who has a baseline spherical equivalent refraction of greater than +2.00 D (4.4%), and increased to nearly 92.0% among children whose baseline spherical equivalent refraction was 0.00 to -0.50 D. The incidence of myopia was higher in children who had less hyperopic baseline refraction, two myopic parents, longer axial length, deeper anterior chamber, higher axial length-corneal radius of curvature ratio, and thinner lenses., Conclusions: Both the annual incidence and progression rates of myopia and high myopia were high in Chinese schoolchildren, especially after grade 3. Hyperopic refraction of children should be monitored before primary school as hyperopia reserve to prevent the onset of myopia and high myopia.

N2  - Importance: Visual performance is important for quality of life. However, vision impairment among adults 85 years and older has not been intensively examined., Objective: To assess the prevalence of mild vision impairment (VI), moderate to severe vision impairment, and blindness and the factors associated with these conditions among a population 85 years and older., Design, Setting, and Participants: The Ural Very Old Study was a population-based cohort study conducted in rural and urban areas in Bashkortostan, Russia from 2017 to 2020. Among 1882 eligible individuals 85 years and older, 1526 participants (81.1%) were enrolled., Exposures: Ophthalmologic, physical, and mental examinations., Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of vision impairment and blindness based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA; measured using modified Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts) in the better eye or both eyes. Mild vision impairment was defined as BCVA worse than 6/12 to 6/18, and moderate to severe VI was defined as BCVA worse than 6/18 but equal to or better than 3/60. Blindness was defined as BCVA worse than 3/60., Results: Among 1526 participants, 1149 individuals (75.3%; 846 women [73.6%]; mean [SD] age, 88.2 [2.8 years]) had available BCVA measurements and were included in the present analysis. Mild vision impairment was present in 114 individuals (9.9%; 95% CI, 8.2%-11.7%), moderate to severe VI in 562 individuals (48.9%; 95% CI, 46.0%-51.8%), and blindness in 68 individuals (5.9%; 95% CI, 4.6%-7.3%). Factors associated with moderate to severe VI were cataracts (324 individuals [57.7% of those with moderate to severe VI and 28.2% of total population; 95% CI, 25.6%-30.8%]), secondary cataracts (4 individuals [0.7% of those with moderate to severe VI and 0.3% of total population; 95% CI, 0%-0.7%]), age-related macular degeneration (78 individuals [13.9% of those with moderate to severe VI and 6.8% of total population; 95% CI, 5.3%-8.3%]), glaucoma (45 individuals [8.0% of those with moderate to severe VI and 3.9% of total population; 95% CI, 2.8%-5.0%]), corneal opacifications (26 individuals [4.6% of those with moderate to severe VI and 2.3% of total population; 95% CI, 1.4%-3.1%]), myopic maculopathy (13 individuals [2.3% of those with moderate to severe VI and 1.1% of total population; 95% CI, 0.5%-1.7%]), and nonglaucomatous optic nerve damage (4 individuals [0.7% of those with moderate to severe VI and 0.3% of total population; 95% CI, 0%-0.7%]). Factors associated with blindness were cataracts (33 individuals [48.5% of those with blindness and 2.9% of total population; 95% CI, 1.9%-3.8%]), age-related macular degeneration (15 individuals [22.1% of those with blindness and 1.3% of total population; 95% CI, 0.7%-2.0%]), glaucoma (7 individuals [10.3% of those with blindness and 0.6% of total population; 95% CI, 0.2%-1.1%]), myopic maculopathy (3 individuals [4.4% of those with blindness and 0.3% of total population; 95% CI, 0%-0.6%]), and corneal opacifications (2 individuals [2.9% of those with blindness and 0.2% of total population; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%]). Higher moderate to severe VI prevalence was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.28; P < .001), higher blood pressure (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .03), lower hand grip force (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95; P < .001), lower score on the Mini-Mental State Examination (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.98; P < .001), lower prothrombin index (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.97; P < .001), lower refractive error (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.97; P = .006), and lower prevalence of previous cataract surgery (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.68; P < .001)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of individuals 85 years and older, the prevalence of moderate to severe VI and blindness was relatively high. Cataracts were the main reversible condition associated with vision loss, and age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and myopic maculopathy were the main irreversible conditions. Because a higher prevalence of moderate to severe VI was associated with lower cognitive function and physical strength, improvement of vision through increases in cataract surgery and measures to prevent and treat irreversible conditions may help to improve cognitive function and physical strength.

N2  - Purpose: This retrospective study investigated the patterns and risk factors of progression of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) of fellow eyes after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) of primary eyes., Methods: The study population comprised 153 patients with MTM in both myopic eyes who sequentially underwent PPV (2006-2021). Observation periods were from PPV of the primary eye (baseline) to PPV of the fellow (end). MTM was graded based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and the ATN (atrophy [A], traction [T], and neovascularization [N]) system. An increase in T grade was considered MTM progression., Results: MTM progressed in 43.8% of fellow eyes during 34.57 +/- 34.08 months. The progression of fellow eyes correlated with T grade of primary eyes (P < 0.001). Risk factors for the progression of MTM in fellow eyes were primary eyes in T4-T5, age at baseline <60 years, and fellow eyes with partial posterior vitreous detachment (PVD; P < 0.001, P = 0.042, and P = 0.002, respectively). Fellow eyes in T1/T2 at baseline progressed faster compared with those in T0 (P < 0.001); the annual rate of progression to T3-T5 of the T0 (T1-T2) groups was 9.98% (24.59%)., Conclusions: Risk factors for the progression of MTM in fellow eyes included PPV when relatively young, primary eye at high T grade, and partial PVD of the fellow eye. Personalized follow-up for fellow eyes should be based on the severity of MTM of both eyes.

N2  - Purpose: To characterize a genetic mutation causing Stickler syndrome in a previously undiagnosed family. Methods: Five generations of a single family suspected of having Stickler syndrome were evaluated clinically and genetically. Results: The demographic and clinical data yielded specific clinical phenotypes of Stickler syndrome in 13 family members; 7 had more than one clinical feature. Four family members underwent genetic analysis: the proband (index patient) and his mother, maternal grandfather, and healthy father. No relevant mutation was detected in the proband on whole exome analysis, but subsequent extension of the analysis to intronic areas yielded a deep intronic mutation, NM_001844.5:c.1527 + 135 G > A. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the results in the family members. Conclusions: Stickler syndrome has several subtypes with variable clinical features. Therefore, predicting the genetic locus of the disease based on clinical characteristics is challenging. We present a rarely described intronic mutation in COL2A1. Genetic testing may aid in the early diagnosis of Stickler syndrome, which is important for genetic counselling, proper clinical management, and improved prognosis.

N2  - Purposes: To investigate the patterns of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) in patients with different grades of myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM). Methods: Patients with MAM who visited Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center from January 2018 to December 2019 were screened. All patients received comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations as well as FAF imaging. The atrophic severity of each eye was identified based on the META-PM classification system, including no myopic retinal lesions (C0), tessellated fundus only (C1), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (C2), patchy chorioretinal atrophy (C3), and macular atrophy (C4). Results: Eighty-nine consecutive patients with 137 affected eyes were included. Four different autofluorescence (AF) patterns were detected: unremarkable AF (48 eyes in C1 and 18 eyes in C2, 48.2%), compound AF (2 eyes in C1 and 12 eyes in C2, 10.2%), patchy AF defect (5 eyes in C2 and 34 eyes in C3, 28.5%), and macular AF defect (18 eyes in C4, 13.1%). Moreover, AF patterns were significantly correlated with age (r = 0.419, P < .001), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (r = 0.592, P < .001), axial length (AL) (r = 0.529, P < .001), and subfovial choroidal thickness (SFCT) (r = -0.728, P < .001). In addition, with the help of FAF, 14.3% (5/35) of eyes initially categorized as C2 merely based on color fundus photographs (CFP) should be categorized as C3. Conclusions: The severity of FAF in eyes with MAM was significantly correlated with myopic characteristics. FAF might be beneficial for detecting unremarkable patchy chorioretinal atrophy on CFP of MAM.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of multispectral imaging (MSI), a noninvasive imaging technique composed of a series of monochromatic scanning light, for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)., METHODS: This was a prospective observational study. Polypoidal lesions on MSI are defined by oval or lobular hyperreflective oval lesion with dark hyporeflective center. Branching vascular networks on MSI is featured by hyperreflective interlacing signal. Detection sensitivity and specificity of polypoidal lesions was compared with indocyanine green angiography, whereas sensitivity and specificity of branching vascular networks, subretinal fluid, and pigment epithelium detachment were compared with optical coherence tomography., RESULTS: Among 67 eyes, 38 eyes (56.7%) were diagnosed with PCV, 7 eyes (10.4%) with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, 13 eyes (19.4%) with central serous chorioretinopathy, 6 eyes (9.0%) with pathological myopia, and 3 eyes (4.5%) with idiopathic choroidal neovascularization. Compared with indocyanine green angiography, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing PCV by MSI alone was 84.21% and 93.10%, respectively, and the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value for PCV by MSI was 94.12% and 81.82%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting polypoidal lesions were 84.21% and 93.10% compared with indocyanine green angiography. Compared with optical coherence tomography, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting branching vascular networks were 95.83% and 88.37%, for the subretinal fluid were 76.92% and 86.67%, and for the pigment epithelium detachment were 91.11% and 90.91%, respectively., CONCLUSION: Multispectral imaging allowed noninvasive visualization of polypoidal lesions and branching vascular networks and may serve as a new diagnostic option for PCV.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe and evaluate the application of a new 3-D printing-assisted personalized macular buckle for patients with myopic foveoschisis (MFS)., METHODS: Twelve eyes of 12 patients with MFS were included in this study. Preoperative MRI images were subsequently measured after marker implantation and imported into the MIMICS software for the 3-D reconstruction of a virtual model of an eyeball and a marker. The virtual eyeball model was designed according to the degree of retinoschisis, which was measured using optical coherence tomography preoperatively. A macular buckle was designed using a titanium stent, assisted by 3-D printing; furthermore, it was surgically placed in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. Visual acuity, axial length and anatomic outcomes were analysed pre- and postoperatively., RESULTS: Macular schisis in all patients was completely resolved after the surgery without any postoperative complications. The mean postoperative best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) improved significantly from 1.21 to 0.92 during the 6-month follow-up period (p < 0.001) and reached 0.9 (p < 0.001) after 2 years. The axial length was significantly shortened during the 2 years postoperatively follow-up period (p < 0.01). The average axial lengths in all patients decreased from 30.62 mm preoperatively to 29.81 mm 1 month postoperatively and remained around 30.16 mm from 1 year after the surgery., CONCLUSION: The 3-D printing technique is useful to predict the indentation height and position of the macular buckle. The 3D-printing-assisted macular buckle, in combination with vitrectomy, is an effective, safe and accurate treatment modality for MFS. Copyright © 2020 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - Purpose: Genetic association between the fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) gene rs339501 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and high myopia remains inconsistent in different studies. This study aimed to investigate the association between FGF10 rs339501 and high myopia in a Han Chinese population. Methods: A total of 675 patients with high myopia (HM), including 246 extreme myopia (EM) patients, and 800 healthy subjects with normal vision from the Chinese Han population were selected as the study subjects. The SNP of FGF10 rs399501 was genotyped by TaqMan allele discrimination assay on the 7300 real-time polymorphism chain reaction system, and the relationship between genotype and allele frequency of FGF10 rs399501 and high myopia was analyzed. Results: In our study, there are statistically significant differences between high myopia patients and controls in the allele frequencies (OR = 1.268, 95%CI = 1.030 ~ 1.560, P = .025), but not in genotype distributions (chi2 = 5.673, P = .059) of rs399501 SNP in the FGF10 gene. In addition, a weak association was found in recessive model (GG vs. AG+AA: OR = 1.929, 95%CI = 1.004 ~ 3.708, P = .045), but not in dominant model (AG+GG vs. AA: OR = 1.239, 95%CI = 0.981 ~ 1.566, P = .072). Moreover, significant associations were also found between FGF10 rs339501 polymorphism and the risk of extreme myopia in all genetic models. Conclusion: Our results do support that the genetic variant of FGF10 rs339501 is associated with susceptibility of high myopia, especially extreme myopia in a Chinese Han population, and further exploration is needed for myopia in other populations.

N2  - The automatic diagnosis of various retinal diseases based on fundus images is important in supporting clinical decision-making. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results in such tasks. However, their high expression ability possibly leads to overfitting. Therefore, data augmentation (DA) techniques have been proposed to prevent overfitting while enriching datasets. Recent CNN architectures with more parameters render traditional DA techniques insufficient. In this study, we proposed a new DA strategy based on multimodal fusion (DAMF) which could integrate the standard DA method, data disrupting method, data mixing method, and autoadjustment method to enhance the image data in the training dataset to create new training images. In addition, we fused the results of the classifier by voting on the basis of DAMF, which further improved the generalization ability of the model. The experimental results showed that the optimal DA mode could be matched to the image dataset through our DA strategy. We evaluated DAMF on the iChallenge-PM dataset. At last, we compared training results between 12 DAMF processed datasets and the original training dataset. Compared with the original dataset, the optimal DAMF achieved an accuracy increase of 2.85% on iChallenge-PM. Copyright © 2021 Jianfeng Cui et al.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the associations between medical check-up items (MCI) for fundus and intraocular pressure abnormality (FIPA) diseases in the Department of Health Management Centre, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (DHMC-FHS)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Individuals who visited DHMC-FHS and underwent MCI between June 2017 to May 2019 were included, 3237 subjects. A total of 356 participants were diagnosed as FIPA and enrolled. The general clinical characteristics were collected. Diseases for FIPA diagnosed included five cohort, high intraocular pressure, diabetic retinopathy, hypertension fundus arteriosclerosis, large eye cup, and high myopia fundus changes. Possible impact factors of MCI included blood routine, B-ultrasound, heart rate, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, standard vision, cerebral arteriosclerosis, body mass, arterial/carotid arteriosclerosis, etc. Further, the Pearson's correlation coefficients and logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between MCI and FIPA., RESULTS: The weighted study population who belonged to FIPA included 356 subjects. There were significant differences in age, IOP, habitual exercise, smoking, sleep duration (P<0.05) between FIPA and without FIPA. And RBC, Hemoglobin, B-ultrasound abnormal event, heart rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, TC, LDL-C, standard vision, cerebral arteriosclerosis, body mass index, carotid arteriosclerosis were positively correlated with high intraocular pressure, hypertension fundus arteriosclerosis and high myopia fundus changes (P < .05). Possible prognosis risk factors, higher IOP, habitual exercise and more frequent smoking affect FIPA prognosis significantly [Odds ratio (OR) = 0.53, P = .01; OR = 0.13, P = .03; OR = 0.83; P = .04, respectively]., CONCLUSION: Of FIPA participants, high intraocular pressure, hypertension fundus arteriosclerosis and high myopia fundus changes were shown a positive relationship with MCI. Control IOP, habitual exercise and less frequent smoking were regarded as positive associations with decreased FIPA. These findings could help us prevent and diagnose FIPA diseases in time via MCI.

N2  - Globally, cases of myopia have reached epidemic levels. High myopia and pathological myopia (PM) are the leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in China, demanding a large volume of myopia screening tasks to control the rapid growing myopic prevalence. It is desirable to develop the automatically intelligent system to facilitate these time- and labor- consuming tasks. In this study, we designed a series of deep learning systems to detect PM and myopic macular lesions according to a recent international photographic classification system (META-PM) classification based on color fundus images. Notably, our systems recorded robust performance both in the test and external validation dataset. The performance was comparable to the general ophthalmologist and retinal specialist. With the extensive adoption of this technology, effective mass screening for myopic population will become feasible on a national scale. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the progression of myopic maculopathy and associated factors in highly myopic Chinese children., METHODS: In this retrospective observational case series, biometric fundus features were morphometrically measured on photographs. Myopic maculopathy was defined as recommended by the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group., RESULTS: The study included 274 children (mean age: 11.7 +/- 2.5 years; mean refractive error: -7.66 +/- 1.87 diopters [D]) with a mean follow-up of 4.9 +/- 1.2 years. Myopic maculopathy progression was detected in 52 eyes (18.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.3-23.7%). In multivariable analysis, myopic maculopathy progression was associated with a decrease in refractive error (odds ratio [OR]: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56-0.92; P < 0.001) (i.e., higher myopization) and enlargement of parapapillary gamma zone (OR: 7.68; 95% CI: 1.63-36.2; P = 0.002). Incident peripapillary diffuse choroidal atrophy, noted in 47 of 236 eyes (20.0%; 95% CI: 14.8-25.2%), was correlated with a decrease in refractive error (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.54-0.92; P = 0.009) (i.e., higher myopization) and greater gamma zone enlargement (OR: 8.28; 95% CI: 1.33-51.7; P = 0.02)., CONCLUSION: Myopia in schoolchildren may have a considerable risk of progressing to myopic maculopathy. Enlargement of parapapillary gamma zone was a main independent risk factor. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE: To characterize peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation (PICC) in highly myopic participants and its associated risk factors., METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional study recruited 890 Chinese participants with bilateral high myopia, defined as <=-6.00 diopters spherical power. Fundus photography and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography were used to determine the presence of PICC, defined as a yellow-orange lesion adjacent to the disc border with a corresponding intrachoroidal hyporeflective space., RESULTS: Among 890 participants, 884 right eyes were included for analysis. The rate of PICC was 3.6% (32 eyes). Peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation was observed in two eyes without myopic retinal lesions, nine eyes with tessellated fundus only, 16 eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, and five eyes with patchy chorioretinal atrophy. The most commonly affected area was inferior disc border (87.5%), followed by multiple (9.4%) and superior (3.1%) disc borders. The multiple linear logistic regression model showed that older age, more myopic spherical equivalent, and longer axial length were associated with the presence of PICC., CONCLUSION: Peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation was present in 3.6% of highly myopic eyes. It was more common in eyes with a higher myopic maculopathy category. Older age, more myopic spherical equivalent, and longer axial length were risk factors for the presence of PICC.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate choroidal arterial watershed zones (CWZ) in highly myopic patients. The relationships between CWZ location and myopic maculopathy location and classification were also examined., METHODS: This retrospective study included 102 consecutive patients who had been diagnosed with myopic maculopathy. Indocyanine green videoangiography was used to evaluate CWZ presence, location, and configuration. Maculopathy signs were used to examine the relationship between CWZ and myopic maculopathy., RESULTS: Various CWZ types were identified in 102 of 158 eyes. The CWZ patterns were classified as vertical optic nerve head (vertical-ONH) in 30 eyes, stellate in 29 eyes, vertical-ONH extending to the macula in 28 eyes, horizontal fovea in eight eyes, and vertical parafovea in seven eyes. Choroidal neovascularization occurred within CWZs in 35 of 42 eyes, and macular atrophy was located within foveal CWZs in 20 of 23 eyes. The CWZ type was significantly correlated with mCNV presence (OR = 5.652, P = 0.014)., CONCLUSIONS: Variations in CWZ topography are associated with myopic maculopathy, particularly in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and macular atrophy, and CWZ is a risk factor for mCNV. This suggests that eyes with macular CWZs are vulnerable to developing myopic maculopathy and are predisposed to mCNV because of ischaemic hypoxia. Copyright © 2021.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to detect the presence of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) based on color fundus photographs using a deep learning model. A total of 1670 color fundus photographs from the Taiwan inherited retinal degeneration project and National Taiwan University Hospital were acquired and preprocessed. The fundus photographs were labeled RP or normal and divided into training and validation datasets (n = 1284) and a test dataset (n = 386). Three transfer learning models based on pre-trained Inception V3, Inception Resnet V2, and Xception deep learning architectures, respectively, were developed to classify the presence of RP on fundus images. The model sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve were compared. The results from the best transfer learning model were compared with the reading results of two general ophthalmologists, one retinal specialist, and one specialist in retina and inherited retinal degenerations. A total of 935 RP and 324 normal images were used to train the models. The test dataset consisted of 193 RP and 193 normal images. Among the three transfer learning models evaluated, the Xception model had the best performance, achieving an AUROC of 96.74%. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping indicated that the contrast between the periphery and the macula on fundus photographs was an important feature in detecting RP. False-positive results were mostly obtained in cases of high myopia with highly tessellated retina, and false-negative results were mostly obtained in cases of unclear media, such as cataract, that led to a decrease in the contrast between the peripheral retina and the macula. Our model demonstrated the highest accuracy of 96.00%, which was comparable with the average results of 81.50%, of the other four ophthalmologists. Moreover, the accuracy was obtained at the same level of sensitivity (95.71%), as compared to an inherited retinal disease specialist. RP is an important disease, but its early and precise diagnosis is challenging. We developed and evaluated a transfer-learning-based model to detect RP from color fundus photographs. The results of this study validate the utility of deep learning in automating the identification of RP from fundus photographs. Copyright © 2021. Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To describe the natural course of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and determine predictive factors for its progression and visual prognosis., METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 113 MTM patients (113 eyes). Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurements and optical coherence tomography findings were recorded., RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 38.2 +/- 11.1 months, 49 of 113 eyes (43.4 %) progressed. The progression rate of outer schisis prominently located in the fovea or posterior staphyloma was significantly higher than that of outer schisis prominently located in paravascular areas (P = 0.0011). MTM with partial posterior vitreous detachment during the follow-up progressed more rapidly than MTM without (P = 0.0447). Patients with older age (> 65 years), without domed-shaped macula and with defects in the ellipsoid zone (EZ) had worse BCVA at the last visit (P = 0.0416, P = 0.0494and P = 0.0130). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that BCVA and defects in the EZ at baseline were significantly associated with the final BCVA (P < 0.0001 and P = < 0.0001, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: MTM has a high possibility for progression. Outer schisis located predominantly in the fovea or posterior staphyloma or with partial posterior vitreous detachment exhibits rapid progression. The integrity of the EZ is related to visual prognosis. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of the claims'-based definition of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in detecting clinically-diagnosed AMD., STUDY DESIGN: A validation study using cross-sectional data., METHODS: Seven hundred clinically-diagnosed AMD patients and seven hundred non-AMD individuals were randomly selected from patients at the Kyoto University Hospital's ophthalmology outpatient clinic between January 2011 and December 2017. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative likelihood ratio of eight different claims'-based definitions of AMD for detecting clinically-diagnosed AMD. These definitions consist of the diagnosis name (AMD) in combination with (1) fluorescent fundus angiography, and/or (2) treatment of AMD, and (3) the exclusion of patients who had a diagnosis of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) or myopic choroidal neovascularization., RESULTS: Defining by the diagnosis name AMD in the claims' data showed the highest accuracy (sensitivity 94.9%, specificity 92.6%, accuracy 93.7%). Combining the diagnosis name AMD with fluorescence fundus angiography and/or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti VEGF) treatment increased the specificity at the expense of sensitivity. Notably, the combination with AMD treatment achieved a specificity of 98.3%., CONCLUSION: The current validation study elucidated the high accuracy of the disease name (AMD) in the claims' data for identifying clinically-diagnosed AMD at a single university hospital. Although drawing wider conclusions may be limited, the results of this study contribute to creating real-world evidence in ophthalmology, based on the National Database of Health Insurance Claims in Japan.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the current prevalence, causes, and factors associated with visual impairment in a Chinese elderly population., METHODS: A random sample of 2164 candidates aged >=70 years was selected. Among them, 1914 participants (response rate: 88.4%) underwent comprehensive eye examinations. The prevalence and causes of visual impairment were estimated, and the associated factors were identified., RESULTS: The standardized prevalence of mild visual impairment (<6/12 to >=6/18), moderate to severe visual impairment (MSVI) (<6/18 to >=3/60), and blindness (<3/60) in the better eye were 20.5%, 25.8%, and 3.4%, respectively. The leading cause of visual impairment was cataract (49.7%), followed by uncorrected refractive error (26.5%), myopic maculopathy (5.8%), and posterior capsular opacification (5.5%). Optical coherence tomography revealed that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities were the third most common cause of monocular mild visual impairment (2.2%) and MSVI (4.4%) in the elderly population. A large number of patients with visual impairment (81.7%) were amenable to undergo the interventions. Visual impairment was associated with advanced age (odds ratio [OR], 1.09 per year; p<0.001), female sex (OR, 1.59; p=0.003), self-reported visual impairment (OR, 1.91; p<0.001), cognitive impairment (OR, 1.40, p=0.005), and high educational level (OR, 0.75; primary, p=0.045; and OR, 0.53, secondary or higher; p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Visual impairment was common in the Chinese elderly population and a severe health and social problem. Practicable policies are urgently needed to popularize eye health knowledge and promote treatments for visual impairment in elderly people in rural China. Copyright © 2021 Shen et al.

She was diagnosed with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) formation and subretinal haemorrhage in her right eye. This is on a background of previous presentations, the first of which was 20 years ago for declining left eye vision. She was subsequently found to be a predicted choroideraemia carrier. However, she also has high myopia, and it is unclear whether the predicted choroideraemia carrier status or high myopia is the main underlying cause of her CNV, although we believe that the former is more likely. The first episode of CNV in her right eye was treated successfully with intravitreal anti-VEGF. However, she experienced four further CNV reactivations in her right eye, all of which were treated successfully with anti-VEGF. At her last follow-up visit to date, Snellen VAs were 6/9 and 3/60 in her right and left eye respectively., CONCLUSION: This is a unique case of CNV formation in a predicted choroideraemia carrier who also has co-existent high myopia. Prompt treatment of CNV activity with anti-VEGF has been efficacious in prevention of subretinal fibrosis and irreversible vision loss and allowed the patient to continue working in her chosen career.

N2  - Purpose: The International Myopia Institute (IMI) Yearly Digest highlights new research considered to be of importance since the publication of the first series of IMI white papers., Methods: A literature search was conducted for articles on myopia between 2019 and mid-2020 to inform definitions and classifications, experimental models, genetics, interventions, clinical trials, and clinical management. Conference abstracts from key meetings in the same period were also considered., Results: One thousand articles on myopia have been published between 2019 and mid-2020. Key advances include the use of the definition of premyopia in studies currently under way to test interventions in myopia, new definitions in the field of pathologic myopia, the role of new pharmacologic treatments in experimental models such as intraocular pressure-lowering latanoprost, a large meta-analysis of refractive error identifying 336 new genetic loci, new clinical interventions such as the defocus incorporated multisegment spectacles and combination therapy with low-dose atropine and orthokeratology (OK), normative standards in refractive error, the ethical dilemma of a placebo control group when myopia control treatments are established, reporting the physical metric of myopia reduction versus a percentage reduction, comparison of the risk of pediatric OK wear with risk of vision impairment in myopia, the justification of preventing myopic and axial length increase versus quality of life, and future vision loss., Conclusions: Large amounts of research in myopia have been published since the IMI 2019 white papers were released. The yearly digest serves to highlight the latest research and advances in myopia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept injections as the primary treatment for subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) by using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was further used for some patients to detect the changes of CNV after treatment., METHODS: In the present study, 21 treatment-naive eyes of 21 patients with subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopic CNV received primary intravitreal aflibercept injections and were under follow-up for a minimum duration of 12 months. Among the 21 patients, 12 underwent OCTA to evaluate the changes in central foveal thickness, selected CNV area, and flow area., RESULTS: The mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) pertaining to all the patients significantly improved from the baseline value of 0.7 to 0.3 logMAR after treatment for 12 months (P = 0.001). However, the improvements in the median BCVA after treatment for three and 12 months were not statistically significant in the younger group (< 50 years), compared to the older group (>= 50 years). One aflibercept injection resolved the CNV in 47.6% (10/21) of the patients. The younger group displayed greater improvement in the median central foveal thickness, compared to the older group. OCTA revealed interlacing or disorganized pattern at the level of the outer retinal layer in 12 subjects with myopic CNV. After 3 months of treatment, both groups displayed a decrease in the size of the selected CNV area and flow area. The interlacing group displayed a trend towards better anatomical improvements., CONCLUSION: Intravitreal aflibercept injection provides long-term improvement in visual acuity in patients with myopic CNV. Eyes with the interlacing pattern on OCTA displayed a greater decrease in size and flow after aflibercept injection., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Before data collection, written informed consent was obtained from each participant, whose identity information was protected by encryption and conversion to a non-identifiable format and removing data links.

N2  - Purpose: To model juvenile-onset myopia progression as a function of race/ethnicity, age, sex, parental history of myopia, and time spent reading or in outdoor/sports activity., Methods: Subjects were 594 children in the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Ethnicity and Refractive Error (CLEERE) Study with at least three study visits: one visit with a spherical equivalent (SPHEQ) less myopic/more hyperopic than -0.75 diopter (D), the first visit with a SPHEQ of -0.75 D or more myopia (onset visit), and another after myopia onset. Myopia progression from the time of onset was modeled using cubic models as a function of age, race/ethnicity, and other covariates., Results: Younger children had faster progression of myopia; for example, the model-estimated 3-year progression in an Asian American child was -1.93 D when onset was at age 7 years compared with -1.43 D when onset was at age 10 years. Annual progression for girls was 0.093 D faster than for boys. Asian American children experienced statistically significantly faster myopia progression compared with Hispanic (estimated 3-year difference of -0.46 D), Black children (-0.88 D), and Native American children (-0.48 D), but with similar progression compared with White children (-0.19 D). Parental history of myopia, time spent reading, and time spent in outdoor/sports activity were not statistically significant factors in multivariate models., Conclusions: Younger age, female sex, and racial/ethnic group were the factors associated with faster myopic progression. This multivariate model can facilitate the planning of clinical trials for myopia control interventions by informing the prediction of myopia progression rates.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to quantitative assess the fundus tessellated density (FTD) and associated factors on the basis of fundus photographs using artificial intelligence., Methods: A detailed examination of 3468 individuals was performed. The proposed method for FTD measurements consists of image preprocessing, sample labeling, deep learning segmentation model, and FTD calculation. Fundus tessellation was extracted as region of interest and then the FTD could be obtained by calculating the average exposed choroid area of per unit area of fundus. Besides, univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis have been conducted for the statistical analysis., Results: The mean FTD was 0.14 +/- 0.08 (median, 0.13; range, 0-0.39). In multivariate analysis, FTD was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with thinner subfoveal choroidal thickness, longer axial length, larger parapapillary atrophy, older age, male sex and lower body mass index. Correlation analysis suggested that the FTD increased by 33.1% (r = 0.33, P < .001) for each decade of life. Besides, correlation analysis indicated the negative correlation between FTD and spherical equivalent (SE) in the myopia participants (r = -0.25, P < 0.001), and no correlations between FTD and SE in the hypermetropia and emmetropic participants., Conclusions: It is feasible and efficient to extract FTD information from fundus images by artificial intelligence-based imaging processing. FTD can be widely used in population screening as a new quantitative biomarker for the thickness of the subfoveal choroid. The association between FTD with pathological myopia and lower visual acuity warrants further investigation., Translational Relevance: Artificial intelligence can extract valuable clinical biomarkers from fundus images and assist in population screening.

N2  - Pathological myopia is a severe case of myopia, i.e., nearsightedness. Pathological myopia is also known as degenerative myopia because it ultimately leads to blindness. In pathological myopia, certain myopia-specific pathologies occur at the eye's posterior i.e., Foster-Fuchs's spot, Cystoid degeneration, Liquefaction, Macular degeneration, Vitreous opacities, Weiss's reflex, Posterior staphyloma, etc. This research is aimed at developing a machine learning (ML) approach for the automatic detection of pathological myopia based on fundus images. A deep learning technique of convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed for this purpose. A CNN model is developed in Spyder. The fundus images are first preprocessed. The preprocessed images are then fed to the designed CNN model. The CNN model automatically extracts the features from the input images and classifies the images i.e., normal image or pathological myopia. The best performing CNN model achieved an AUC score of 0.9845. The best validation loss obtained is 0.1457. The results show that the model can be successfully employed to detect pathological myopia from the fundus images. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

N2  - PURPOSE: Identifying axial length growth rate as an indicator of fast progression before initiating atropine 0.01% for myopia progression in children., METHOD: From baseline, axial length growth over six months was measured prospectively. Subjects were then initiated on atropine 0.01% if axial length growth was greater than 0.1mm per 6 months (fast progressors), axial length and spherical equivalent change measurements recorded every six months. The rate of change was compared to the baseline pre-treatment rate. If axial length change was below the threshold, subjects received monitoring only., RESULTS: 73 subjects were identified as fast progressors and commenced atropine 0.01%, (mean baseline refraction of OD -2.9+/-1.6, OS -2.9+/-1.8 and a mean baseline axial length OD 24.62 +/- 1.00 mm, OS 24.53 +/- 0.99 mm). At six months, the mean paired difference of axial length growth rate was significantly reduced by 50% of baseline (all 73 subjects, p<0.05). 53 subjects followed to 12 months, and 12 to 24 months maintained a reduced growth rate. Change in mean spherical equivalent was significantly reduced compared to pre-treatment refractive error (mean paired difference p<0.05) and at each subsequent visit. 91 children were slow progressors and remained untreated. Their axial length growth rate did not change significantly out to 24 months. Spherical equivalent changed less than -0.5D annually in this group., CONCLUSION: Identifying fast progressors before treatment initiation demonstrated a strong treatment effect with atropine 0.01% reducing their individual rate of myopia progression by 50%. Another large group of myopic children, slow progressors, continued without medical intervention. A baseline axial length growth rate is proposed as a guideline to identify fast progressors who are more likely to benefit from atropine 0.01%.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the tractional elements of pathologic myopia (PM; e.g. myopic traction maculopathy [MTM], posterior staphyloma [PS], and aberrant posterior vitreous detachment [PVD]) are associated with myopic macular degeneration (MMD) independent of age and axial length, among highly myopic (HM) eyes., Methods: One hundred twenty-nine individuals with 239 HM eyes from the Myopic and Pathologic Eyes in Singapore (MyoPES) cohort underwent ocular biometry, fundus photography, swept-source optical coherence tomography, and ocular B-scan ultrasound. Images were analyzed for PVD grade, and presence of MTM, PS, and MMD. The chi2 test was done to determine the difference in prevalence of MMD between eyes with and without PVD, PS, and MTM. Multivariate probit regression analyses were performed to ascertain the relationship between the potential predictors (PVD, PS, and MTM) and outcome variable (MMD), after accounting for possible confounders (e.g. age and axial length). Marginal effects were reported., Results: Controlling for potential confounders, eyes with MTM have a 29.92 percentage point higher likelihood of having MMD (P = 0.003), and eyes with PS have a 25.72 percentage point higher likelihood of having MMD (P = 0.002). The likelihood of MMD increases by 10.61 percentage points per 1 mm increase in axial length (P < 0.001). Subanalysis revealed that eyes with incomplete PVD have a 22.54 percentage point higher likelihood of having MMD than eyes with early PVD (P = 0.04)., Conclusions: Our study demonstrated an association between tractional (MTM, PS, and persistently incomplete PVD) and degenerative elements of PM independent of age and axial length. These data provide further insights into the pathogenesis of MMD.

N2  - Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the most severe form of retinopathy and cone/cone-rod dystrophy (CORD) is a common form of inherited retinopathy. Variants in GUCY2D constitute the most common cause of LCA and autosomal dominant CORD (ADCORD). The purpose of this study was to reveal novel variants and document associated phenotypes of patients with GUCY2D-associated retinopathy. Fifty-two potentially pathogenic variants (PPVs), including 12 novel ones (p.Gly144_Ala164del, p.Trp154Glyfs*12, p.Leu186Pro, p.Ala207Pro, p.Ala229Asp, p.Ala353Glu, p.Trp372*, p.Arg528*, p.Arg660Pro, p.Ile682Thr, p.Trp788Cys, and c.1026 + 171_*486del), were identified in 16 families with ADCORD and 34 families with autosomal recessive LCA (ARLCA). The novel variant c.1026 + 171_*486del is a large-scale (16.3 kb) deletion involving exons 4-20 of GUCY2D, and was identified in an ARLCA family in heterozygous status mimicking a homozygous p.Trp788Cys variant. Among the detected 52 PPVs, 32 (61.5%) were missense, seven (13.5%) were splicing, six (11.5%) were nonsense, four (7.7%) were inframe indel, and three (5.8%) were frameshift deletion. The median age of examination in 27 patients with ADCORD was 21.0 years (ranges 3-54) with a median visual acuity (VA) of 0.10 (ranges 0.02-0.90). There were 48.0% of patients with macular atrophy, 86.4% with severe reduced or extinguished cone responses, 77.3% with normal or mildly reduced rod responses, and 60.9% with high myopia. Visual impairment, macular dystrophy, and cone dysfunction deteriorated with age. The median age of examination in 34 patients with ARLCA was 1.1 years (ranges 0.3-25). There were 55.9% of patients with roving nystagmus, 68.2% with VA of worse than hand motion, 59.4% with almost normal fundus, 90.6% with extinguished rod and cone responses, and 50.0% with high hyperopia. In conclusions, twelve novel PPVs in GUCY2D (including a novel large-scale deletion) were identified. Most (32/52, 61.5%) of causative GUCY2D variants were missense. Progressive development of macular atrophy, cone dysfunction, visual impairment, and myopia are four major characteristics of GUCY2D-associated ADCORD. Normal fundus, roving nystagmus, and hypermetropia in early age are common findings specific to GUCY2D-associated ARLCA. The obtained data in this study will be of value in counselling patients and designing future therapeutic approaches. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: To compare morphological features of staphyloma (type and grade) with structural and functional outcomes in 11 patients with symptomatic myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM) who underwent macular buckle surgery., Methods: A retrospective observational case series, where a chart review was conducted of the type (Curtin classification) and grade of staphyloma (USG B-scan based). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) macula analysis done preoperatively and postoperatively 1 and 6-8 weeks), Visual acuity was recorded in log mar., Results: With an average myopia of -10.35 D (-5 to -14.5 D), there were four patients with types II and IX staphyloma and seven with type I staphyloma. The average axial length was 28.6 +/- 0.98 mm in type II/IX and 26.2 +/- 0.8 mm in type I. Preoperative OCT features were outer retinal layer schisis (11), retinal detachment (foveal: 2, macular: 8), macular hole (lamellar: 3, full thickness: 4), and taut posterior hyaloid (3). Postoperatively, patients with type II/IX staphyloma had significant gain in visual acuity from 1.05 +/- 0.3 to 0.74 +/- 0.2 Log Mar. The structural features also responded better in patients with types II/IX staphyloma, with all patients having more than 90% reduction in schisis and retinal attachment at 6 weeks. Whereas only two patients with type I staphyloma had similar reduction in schisis at 6 weeks and only one had complete retinal attachment., Conclusion: In patients with MTM, the staphyloma characteristics preoperatively can help us prognosticate about structural and functional success after macular buckle surgery. In our small case series, patients with type II/IX staphyloma and larger axial length had better structural and functional outcomes.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of posterior staphyloma (PS) types in pathological myopia (PM) with age, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent (SE), axial length (AL), and myopic retinoschisis (MRS) using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT)., Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 108 eyes of 59 patients with PM from the Henan Eye Institute, China. We classified the PS types based on current international classification criteria and analyzed the risk factors (age, AL, MRS, and BCVA)., Results: Most of the patients with bilateral PM had the same PS type (80.43%) in both eyes. Complex PS was more common in elderly patients than in younger patients (P < 0.05). Eyes with wide macular PS had a longer AL (P = 0.012) and worse BCVA (P = 0.049) than those with other PS types. MRS was always comorbid with PS (93.33%), and macular PS was the most common (82.14%)., Conclusions: Complex PS is associated with patient age. PS is related to MRS, and these changes observed by 3D-MRI and OCT affect the prognosis of visual acuity. The 3D-MRI scans shows changes in the eye shape and PS efficiently., Translational Relevance: In patients with PM, 3D-MRI can guide the planning of posterior scleral reinforcement.

N2  - PURPOSE: The prevalence of myopia is increasing around the world, stimulating interest in methods to slow its progression. The primary justification for slowing myopia progression is to reduce the risk of vision loss through sight-threatening ocular pathologic features in later life. The article analyzes whether the potential benefits of slowing myopia progression by 1 diopter (D) justify the potential risks associated with treatments., METHODS: First, the known risks associated with various methods of myopia control are summarized, with emphasis on contact lens wear. Based on available data, the risk of visual impairment and predicted years of visual impairment are estimated for a range of incidence levels. Next, the increased risk of potentially sight-threatening conditions associated with different levels of myopia are reviewed. Finally, a model of the risk of visual impairment as a function of myopia level is developed, and the years of visual impairment associated with various levels of myopia and the years of visual impairment that could be prevented with achievable levels of myopia control are estimated., RESULTS: Assuming an incidence of microbial keratitis between 1 and 25 per 10 000 patient-years and that 15% of cases result in vision loss leads to the conclusion that between 38 and 945 patients need to be exposed to 5 years of wear to produce 5 years of vision loss. Each additional 1 D of myopia is associated with a 58%, 20%, 21%, and 30% increase in the risk of myopic maculopathy, open-angle glaucoma, posterior subcapsular cataract, and retinal detachment, respectively. The predicted mean years of visual impairment ranges from 4.42 in a person with myopia of -3 D to 9.56 in a person with myopia of -8 D, and a 1-D reduction would lower these by 0.74 and 1.21 years, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The potential benefits of myopia control outweigh the risks: the number needed to treat to prevent 5 years of visual impairment is between 4.1 and 6.8, whereas fewer than 1 in 38 will experience a loss of vision as a result of myopia control.

N2  - BACKGROUND: An estimated 49.8% of the world population will be myopic by 2050. Multifocal contact lenses (MFCLs) and orthokeratology (OK) reduce peripheral retinal hyperopic defocus, which animal studies have shown to positively impact eye growth. MFCLs are expected to slow myopic progression by 20 - 50% and OK by 30 - 60%, making them valuable therapeutic tools. In view of the guidelines for myopia management published by the International Myopia Institute in 2019, the aim of this retrospective data analysis of a tertiary care center was to review past experience with OK and MFCLs for myopia control and gain information to update current practice., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The contact lens (CL) database of the Eye Clinic of the University Hospital of Basel was searched with the label "myopia progression" between January 2012 - 2020. Patients were included if they gave informed consent, were younger than 19 years old at baseline, and had no ocular comorbidities that could potentially compromise vision. Primary outcomes were progression of spherical equivalent refraction for MFCL patients and progression of axial length (AL) for the OK group, comparing with historical data from OK trials. Secondary outcomes were the presence of risk factors for myopia, age, refractive error at baseline, follow-up duration, and adverse effects during therapy., RESULTS: Twenty-one patients could be included, with a mean age of 12.80 +/- 3.32 years (y) at baseline. The majority of patients were older than 12 years and already myopic (- 3.89 +/- 2.30 diopters) when control treatment was started. Overall, follow-up ranged from 0.08 to 6.33 years (2.03 +/- 1.66 y). In the patients treated with MFCLs, myopia control improved significantly when patients changed from spectacles to MFCLs. In the OK group, 14% dropped out during the first year and 2 patients had multiple AL measurements during therapy, which showed a slower growth of AL when compared to other OK trials and controls with spectacles. There were two cases of non-severe keratitis. Environmental risk factors had not been documented and only 48% of clinical records had a documented family risk assessment., CONCLUSION: Patients showed a slower myopia progression under MFCLs or OK, which supports their role as a treatment option in myopia management. In this regard, AL measurement is an important additional parameter to be included in the assessment of myopia progression in clinical practice. Identification of children at risk of developing high/pathologic myopia (family history, environmental risk factors) needs to improve so that the first stages of myopic shift can be recognized and targeted. Changes in lifestyle should be actively encouraged, especially when the impact of decreases in outdoor time secondary to COVID-19 is yet to become clear. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

N2  - The International Myopia Institute's (IMI) mission is to advance research, education, and management of myopia to decrease future vision impairment and blindness associated with increasing myopia. Its approach is to bring together scientists, clinicians, policymakers, government members, and educators into the field of myopia to stimulate collaboration and sharing of knowledge. The latest reports are on pathologic myopia, the impact of myopia, risk factors for myopia, accommodation and binocular vision in myopia development and progression, and the prevention of myopia and its progression. Together with the digest updating the 2019 International Myopia Institute white papers using the research published in the last 18 months, these evidence-based consensus white papers help to clarify the imperative for myopia control and the role of environmental modification initiatives, informing an evidence-based clinical approach. This guidance includes who to treat and when to start or stop treatment, and the advantages and limitations of different management approaches.

N2  - The prevalence of myopia has markedly increased in East and Southeast Asia, and pathologic consequences of myopia, including myopic maculopathy and high myopia-associated optic neuropathy, are now some of the most common causes of irreversible blindness. Hence, strategies are warranted to reduce the prevalence of myopia and the progression to high myopia because this is the main modifiable risk factor for pathologic myopia. On the basis of published population-based and interventional studies, an important strategy to reduce the development of myopia is encouraging schoolchildren to spend more time outdoors. As compared with other measures, spending more time outdoors is the safest strategy and aligns with other existing health initiatives, such as obesity prevention, by promoting a healthier lifestyle for children and adolescents. Useful clinical measures to reduce or slow the progression of myopia include the daily application of low-dose atropine eye drops, in concentrations ranging between 0.01% and 0.05%, despite the side effects of a slightly reduced amplitude of accommodation, slight mydriasis, and risk of an allergic reaction; multifocal spectacle design; contact lenses that have power profiles that produce peripheral myopic defocus; and orthokeratology using corneal gas-permeable contact lenses that are designed to flatten the central cornea, leading to midperipheral steeping and peripheral myopic defocus, during overnight wear to eliminate daytime myopia. The risk-to-benefit ratio needs to be weighed up for the individual on the basis of their age, health, and lifestyle. The measures listed above are not mutually exclusive and are beginning to be examined in combination.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Myopic maculopathy (MM) is the most serious and irreversible complication of pathologic myopia, which is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. Clinic proposed limited number of factors related to MM. To explore additional features strongly related with MM from optic disc region, we employ a machine learning based radiomics analysis method, which could explore and quantify more hidden or imperceptible MM-related features to the naked eyes and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of MM and therefore may assist to distinguish the high-risk population in an early stage., METHODS: A total of 457 eyes (313 patients) were enrolled and were divided into severe MM group and without severe MM group. Radiomics analysis was applied to depict features significantly correlated with severe MM from optic disc region. Receiver Operating Characteristic were used to evaluate these features' performance of classifying severe MM., RESULTS: Eight new MM-related image features were discovered from the optic disc region, which described the shapes, textural patterns and intensity distributions of optic disc region. Compared with clinically reported MM-related features, these newly discovered features exhibited better abilities on severe MM classification. And the mean values of most features were markedly changed between patients with peripapillary diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (PDCA) and macular diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (MDCA)., CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning and radiomics method are useful tools for mining more MM-related features from the optic disc region, by which complex or even hidden MM-related features can be discovered and decoded. In this paper, eight new MM-related image features were found, which would be useful for further quantitative study of MM-progression. As a nontrivial byproduct, marked changes between PDCA and MDCA was discovered by both new image features and clinic features.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Myopic maculopathy (MM) is one of the major causes of visual impairment and irreversible blindness in eyes with pathologic myopia (PM). However, the classification of each type of lesion associated with MM has not been determined. Recently, a new MM classification system, known as the ATN grading and classification system, was proposed; it is based on the fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and includes three variable components: atrophy (A), traction (T), and neovascularization (N). This study aimed to perform an independent evaluation of interobserver and intraobserver agreement for the recently developed ATN grading system for MM., METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Fundus photographs and OCT images of 125 patients (226 eyes) with various MMs were evaluated and classified using the ATN grading of the new MM classification system by four blinded and independent evaluators (2 attending ophthalmologists and 2 ophthalmic residents). All cases were randomly re-evaluated by the same observers after an interval of 6 weeks. The kappa coefficient (kappa) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the interobserver and intraobserver agreement., RESULTS: The interobserver agreement was substantial when considering the maculopathy type (A, T, and N). The weighted Fleiss kappa values for each MM type (A, T, and N) were 0.651 (95% CI: 0.602-0.700), 0.734 (95% CI: 0.689-0.779), and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.649-0.755), respectively. The interobserver agreement when considering the subtypes was good or excellent, except for stages A1, A2, and N1, in which the weighted kappa value was less than 0.6, with moderate agreement. The intraobserver agreement of types and subtypes was excellent, with kappa > 0.8. No significant differences were observed between the attending ophthalmologists and residents for interobserver reliability or intraobserver reproducibility., CONCLUSIONS: The ATN classification allows an adequate agreement among ophthalmologists with different qualifications and by the same observer on separate occasions. Future prospective studies should further evaluate whether this classification can be better implemented in clinical decision-making and disease progression assessments.

N2  - BACKGROUND: By 2050, almost 5 billion people globally are projected to have myopia, of whom 20% are likely to have high myopia with clinically significant risk of sight-threatening complications such as myopic macular degeneration. These are diagnoses that typically require specialist assessment or measurement with multiple unconnected pieces of equipment. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches might be effective for risk stratification and to identify individuals at highest risk of visual loss. However, unresolved challenges for AI medical studies remain, including paucity of transparency, auditability, and traceability., METHODS: In this retrospective multicohort study, we developed and tested retinal photograph-based deep learning algorithms for detection of myopic macular degeneration and high myopia, using a total of 226 686 retinal images. First we trained and internally validated the algorithms on datasets from Singapore, and then externally tested them on datasets from China, Taiwan, India, Russia, and the UK. We also compared the performance of the deep learning algorithms against six human experts in the grading of a randomly selected dataset of 400 images from the external datasets. As proof of concept, we used a blockchain-based AI platform to demonstrate the real-world application of secure data transfer, model transfer, and model testing across three sites in Singapore and China., FINDINGS: The deep learning algorithms showed robust diagnostic performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves [AUC] of 0.969 (95% CI 0.959-0.977) or higher for myopic macular degeneration and 0.913 (0.906-0.920) or higher for high myopia across the external testing datasets with available data. In the randomly selected dataset, the deep learning algorithms outperformed all six expert graders in detection of each condition (AUC of 0.978 [0.957-0.994] for myopic macular degeneration and 0.973 [0.941-0.995] for high myopia). We also successfully used blockchain technology for data transfer, model transfer, and model testing between sites and across two countries., INTERPRETATION: Deep learning algorithms can be effective tools for risk stratification and screening of myopic macular degeneration and high myopia among the large global population with myopia. The blockchain platform developed here could potentially serve as a trusted platform for performance testing of future AI models in medicine., FUNDING: None. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of childhood progression of spherical equivalent (SE) with high myopia (HM) in teenagers in the Singapore Cohort of Risk factors for Myopia (SCORM)., Methods: We included 928 SCORM children followed over a mean follow-up of 6.9 +/- 1.0 years from baseline (6-11 years old) until their teenage years (12-19 years old). Cycloplegic autorefraction and axial length (AL) measurements were performed yearly. The outcomes in teenagers were HM (SE <= -5 diopter [D)], AL >= 25 mm, SE and AL. Three-year SE and AL progression in childhood and baseline SE and AL with outcomes were evaluated using multivariable logistic or linear regression models, with predictive performance of risk factors assessed using the area under the curve (AUC)., Results: At the last visit, 9.8% of teenagers developed HM and 22.7% developed AL >= 25 mm. In multivariate regression analyses, every -0.3 D/year increase in 3-year SE progression and every 0.2 mm/year increase in 3-year AL progression were associated with a -1.14 D greater teenage SE and 0.52 mm greater teenage AL (P values < 0.001). The AUC (95% confidence interval [CI]) of a combination of 3-year SE progression and baseline SE for teenage HM was 0.97 (95% CI = 0.95 - 0.98). The AUC of 3-year AL progression and baseline AL for teenage AL >= 25 mm was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.89 - 0.94)., Conclusions: Three-year myopia progression in childhood combined with baseline SE or AL were good predictors of teenage HM. Clinicians may use this combination of factors to guide timing of interventions, potentially reducing the risk of HM later in life.

N2  - High myopia is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Myopia progression may lead to pathological changes of lens and affect the outcome of lens surgery, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we find an increased lens size in highly myopic eyes associated with up-regulation of beta/gamma-crystallin expressions. Similar findings are replicated in two independent mouse models of high myopia. Mechanistic studies show that the transcription factor MAF plays an essential role in up-regulating beta/gamma-crystallins in high myopia, by direct activation of the crystallin gene promoters and by activation of TGF-beta1-Smad signaling. Our results establish lens morphological and molecular changes as a characteristic feature of high myopia, and point to the dysregulation of the MAF-TGF-beta1-crystallin axis as an underlying mechanism, providing an insight for therapeutic interventions.

N2  - To investigate the influence of age on the function and morphology of patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and to evaluate the effect and prognostic factors of recurrence of Conbercept treatment on mCNV patients over 50 years. A total of 64 patients (64 eyes) with mCNV were enrolled in this retrospective study. The differences in baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and morphological features on imaging between the younger group (< 50 years) and the older group (>= 50 years) were analyzed. Of all, 21 eyes of 21 mCNV patients aged over 50 years who received Conbercept injection were further analyzed. Between the younger and the older group, significant differences were shown in mean BCVA (0.58 +/- 0.28 vs 0.77 +/- 0.31), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) (108.17 +/- 78.32 mum vs 54.68 +/- 39.03 mum) and frequency of vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (VIA) (2 vs 13), respectively (P < 0.05). After treated with Conbercept, the mean BCVA of 21 older mCNV patients increased from 0.83 +/- 0.30 at baseline to 0.49 +/- 0.24 at one year. Baseline BCVA, external limiting membrane damage, CNV area and CNV location correlated with the visual acuity at the 1-year follow-up. There were 7 (33.3%) recurrent cases during the follow-up and the risk of recurrence in patients with baseline central macular thickness (CMT) >= 262.86 mum was 14 times greater than that of patients with CMT < 262.86 mum. The risk of recurrence increased 1.84 times for every 100-mum increment in the CMT. Patients over 50 years with mCNV had a worse BCVA, thinner choroid, and higher risk of VIA than young mCNV patients. The standard Conbercept treatment strategy was safe and effective in mCNV patients over 50 years. As patients over 50 years with a greater CMT have a high risk of recurrence, more attention should be paid on these patients by following them up closely.

N2  - Qualitative analysis of fundus photographs enables straightforward pattern recognition of advanced pathologic myopia. However, it has limitations in defining the classification of the degree or extent of early disease, such that it may be biased by subjective interpretation. In this study, we used the fovea, optic disc, and deepest point of the eye (DPE) as the three major markers (i.e., key indicators) of the posterior globe to quantify the relative tomographic elevation of the posterior sclera (TEPS). Using this quantitative index from eyes of 860 myopic patients, support vector machine based machine learning classifier predicted pathologic myopia an AUROC of 0.828, with 77.5% sensitivity and 88.07% specificity. Axial length and choroidal thickness, the existing quantitative indicator of pathologic myopia only reached an AUROC of 0.758, with 75.0% sensitivity and 76.61% specificity. When all six indices were applied (four TEPS, AxL, and SCT), the discriminative ability of the SVM model was excellent, demonstrating an AUROC of 0.868, with 80.0% sensitivity and 93.58% specificity. Our model provides an accurate modality for identification of patients with pathologic myopia and may help prioritize these patients for further treatment.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence and visual outcomes of macular Bruch membrane (BM) defects in patients treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) for choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathological myopia (mCNV)., METHODS: Single-center retrospective observational case series of 68 eyes from 62 patients with mCNV treated with one anti-VEGF injection followed by a pro re nata (1 + PRN) regimen. A minimum follow-up of 6 months was defined. Chorioretinal atrophy was assessed by fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and SD-OCT., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 28.5 (range 6-89) months with a median number of 5 anti-VEGF injections. At baseline, 27.9% of eyes had macular BM defects increasing to 36.8% during follow-up (p<0.001). Eyes without macular BM defects at the baseline had higher BCVA at the last observation than patients with BM defects (p=0.003). An increase of 5 or more ETDRS letters was more frequent in eyes without BM defects (p=0.001). At the end of follow-up, mCNV-related macular atrophy was present in 44.1%; out of which, 83.3% presented macular BM defects (p<0.001). Eyes with mCNV-related macular atrophy without BM defects had a significant increase of best-corrected visual acuity compared with eyes with mCNV-related macular atrophy and BM defect (p=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: Macular Bruch membrane defects are often seen in mCNV and have a significant impact in visual acuity and prognosis. Eyes with macular BM defects have a poorer response and worse visual outcomes after anti-VEGF therapy. Copyright © 2021.

N2  - The prevalence of myopia is increasing extensively worldwide. The number of people with myopia in 2020 is predicted to be 2.6 billion globally, which is expected to rise up to 4.9 billion by 2050, unless preventive actions and interventions are taken. The number of individuals with high myopia is also increasing substantially and pathological myopia is predicted to become the most common cause of irreversible vision impairment and blindness worldwide and also in Europe. These prevalence estimates indicate the importance of reducing the burden of myopia by means of myopia control interventions to prevent myopia onset and to slow down myopia progression. Due to the urgency of the situation, the European Society of Ophthalmology decided to publish this update of the current information and guidance on management of myopia. The pathogenesis and genetics of myopia are also summarized and epidemiology, risk factors, preventive and treatment options are discussed in details.

N2  - Topic: Ultra-widefield (UWF) imaging of the myopic eye. Clinical Relevance: Myopes, and particularly high and pathologic myopes, present a unique challenge in fundoscopic imaging. Critical pathology is often located in the anteriormost portion of the retina, variations in posterior segment contour are difficult to capture in two-dimensional images, and extremes in axial length make simply focusing imaging devices difficult. Methods: We review the evolution of modalities for ophthalmic imaging (color fundus photography [CFP], optical coherence topography [OCT], angiography, artificial intelligence [AI]) to present day UWF technology and its impact on our understanding of myopia. Results: Advances in UWF technology address many of the challenges in fundoscopic imaging of myopes, providing new insights into the structure and function of the myopic eye. UWF CFP improves our ability to detect and document anterior peripheral pathology prevalent in approximately half of all high myopes. UWF OCT better captures the staphylomatous contour of the myopic eye, providing enhanced visualization of the vitreoretinal interface and progressive development of myopic traction maculopathy. UWF angiography highlights the posterior vortex veins, thin choriocapillaris, far peripheral avascularity, and peripheral retinal capillary microaneurysms more prevalent in the myopic eye. Researchers have demonstrated the ability of AI algorithms to predict refractive error, and great potential remains in the use of AI technology for the screening and prevention of myopic disease. Conclusion: We note significant progress in our ability to capture anterior pathology and improved image quality of the posterior segment of high and pathologic myopes. The next jump forward for UWF imaging will be the ability to capture a high quality ora to ora multimodal fundoscopic image in a single scan that will allow for sensitive AI-assisted screening of myopic disease.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the microvasculature and structural characteristics of the eyes of myopic patients and their association with posterior staphyloma (PS)., METHODS: This was a retrospective, case-control study comprising of 106 eyes from 72 individuals. Using 1:1 matching of axial length (AL) of their eyes, patients were allocated into a PS group or no posterior staphyloma (NPS) group. All patients were examined using ultra-widefield fundus imaging, optical coherence tomography angiography, and ocular biometry to acquire microvasculature and microstructure parameters., RESULTS: The anterior chamber depth (ACD) of the PS group was significantly different from that of the NPS group (3.56 mm vs 3.76 mm, P < 0.001), as was 1ens thickness (3.72 mm vs 3.57 mm, P = 0.005) and spherical equivalent (SE)(-10.11D vs -8.80D, P = 0.014). The PS group had reduced choriocapillaris flow, subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), and a thinner retinal layer compared with the NPS group. No difference in retinal blood flow between the two groups was observed. The PS group exhibited a smaller disc area (15082.89 vs 17,043.32, P = 0.003) and angle alpha between temporal retinal arterial vascular arcades (113.29degreevs 128.39degree, P = 0.003), a larger disc tilt ratio (1.41 vs 1.24, P < 0.001) and parapapillary atrophy (PPA) area (13840.98 vs 8753.86, P = 0.020), compared with the NPS group. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that disc tilt ratio (P = 0.031) and SFCT (P = 0.015) were significant predictors of PS. In addition, PS (P = 0.049), AL (P = 0.003), corneal refractive power (P < 0.001), ACD (P = 0.022), relative lens position (P = 0.045), and disc area (P = 0.011) were significant predictors of SE., CONCLUSIONS: PS was found to be closely linked to a reduction in choriocapillaris perfusion and anatomical abnormalities including posterior and anterior segments. Furthermore, PS exacerbated the progression of myopia. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

N2  - Discovering a relationship between axial length and vitreous volume would be helpful since the axial length is easier to measure than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters. This study aimed to analyze the topography of human eyes with pathological myopia through volume rendering images by high-resolution 3D-MRI and to establish a model to estimate the vitreous volume. This was a retrospective, non-randomized, controlled study of patients evaluated at Tongren Hospital from July 7, 2007 to December 12, 2018. The controls were emmetropic volunteers. All participants underwent ophthalmic examinations. Axial length was measured with an IOL Master. High-resolution 3D MRI and volume rendering was utilized for all the eyes. Logistic regression was used to establish a model to predict the vitreous volume.A total of 280 emmetropic eyes and 290 eyes with pathological myopia were included. Males represented 60.7% and 65.5% of the individuals. The mean axial lengths of those two groups were 23.1 +/- 0.8 mm (95%CI: 22.7-23.4 mm) and 28.3 +/- 2.2 mm (95%CI: 27.5-29.2 mm), respectively (P < .001). The regression model in the pathological myopic group for calculating the vitreous volume according to the axial length was: Vitreous volume = 546.27 x axial length - 6977.12. The regression model in the emmetropic group for calculating the vitreous volume according to the axial length was: Vitreous volume = 458.35 x axial length - 6331.14 (R = 0.360, P = .001). Elongation of the axial length is involved in eyeball enlargement in pathological myopic eyes. Measurement of the axial length could be recommended for the estimation of the vitreous volume during vitrectomy if vitreous cavity filling is needed.

N2  - PRECIS: It is generally assumed that optical coherence tomography (OCT) cannot be used to diagnose glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) in high myopes. However, this study presents evidence that there is sufficient information in OCT scans to allow for accurate diagnosis of GON in most eyes with high myopia., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that glaucomatous damage can be accurately diagnosed in most high myopes via an assessment of the OCT results., PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eyes from 60 glaucoma patients or suspects, referred for OCT scans and evaluation, had corrected spherical refractive errors worse than -6 D and/or axial lengths >=26.5 mm. An OCT specialist judged whether the eye had GON, based upon OCT circle scans of the disc and cube scans centered on the macula. A glaucoma specialist made the same judgement using all available information (eg, family history, repeat visits, intraocular pressure, 10-2 and 24-2 visual fields, OCT). A reference standard was created based upon the glaucoma specialist's classifications. In addition, the glaucoma specialist judged whether the eyes had peripapillary atrophy (PPA), epiretinal membrane (ERM), tilted disc (TD), and/or a paravascular inner retinal defect (PIRD)., RESULTS: The OCT specialist correctly identified 97 of the 100 eyes using the OCT information. In 63% of the cases, the inner circle scan alone was sufficient. For the rest, additional scans were requested. In addition, 81% of the total eyes had: PPA (79%), ERM (18%), PIRD (26%), and/or TD (48%)., CONCLUSIONS: For most eyes with high myopia, there is sufficient information in OCT scans to allow for accurate diagnosis of GON. However, the optimal use of the OCT will depend upon training to read OCT scans, which includes taking into consideration myopia related OCT artifacts and segmentation errors, as well as PPA, ERM, PIRD, and TD.

N2  - RATIONALE: To report a rare case of phacoemulsification cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation that improved visual acuity and capsular stability in a patient with pathologic myopia and axial length >38 mm., PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old Chinese man with high myopia since childhood who had lost sight in his left eye at the age of 25 due to retinal detachment. He was referred for ophthalmological assessment due to decreased vision in the right eye, in which the best-corrected visual acuity at distance was hand motion., DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with cataract, high myopia, subluxated lens, and loose zonules in the right eye. The left eyeball showed atrophy., INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent uneventful phacoemulsification. An intraocular lens (Sensar AR40M) and capsular tension ring were implanted within the capsular bag. After surgery, the patient was given eye drops containing tobramycin and dexamethasone eye drops for 1 month and eye drops containing 0.1% sodium diclofenac for 2 months., OUTCOMES: There were no postoperative complications. During 1-year follow-up, uncorrected visual acuity was 20/80 and the manifest refraction was -2.50DS/-1.00DC*80, with corrected distance visual acuity of 20/60. Cataract surgery maintained adequate vision for daily living., LESSONS: Implantation of specific lens and capsular tension ring as well as prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help prevent capsular contraction and posterior capsule opacification in patients with pathologic myopia and extremely long axial length.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe a comprehensive OCT-based classification of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM)., METHODS: Two hundred eighty-one eyes with MTM (visited from 2006 to 2018), were retrospectively reviewed for age, best-corrected-visual-acuity (BCVA), axial length (AL), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and wide-field color fundus-photographs. The study was divided in two Phases. Phase 1: MTM types were categorized with OCT and correlated with age and BCVA. The type of staphyloma was described. Phase 2: the evolution of MTM was studied evaluating at least three OCT exams of each eye taken at different timings (interval between each exam: 1-10 years)., RESULTS: Phase 1: We identified, four MTM retinal stages (1. Inner/Outer Maculoschisis; 2. Predominantly outer Maculoschisis; 3. Maculoschisis-Macular Detachment; 4. Macular Detachment) and three foveal stages (a. Normal fovea; b. Inner Lamellar-Macular-Hole; c. Full-Thickness-Macular-Hole). Outer-Lamellar-Macular-Holes and epiretinal abnormalities were associated findings. Stages 1 to 2 were younger than stages 3 to 4 (p < 0.05). BCVA in stages 1, 2 was similar, and higher than stages 3, 4 (p < 0.02). About 14% of eyes had no staphyloma, 73% of eyes had staphyloma type 1 or 2. MTM stages were not correlated with AL. Phase 2: The retina could change in time from stage 1 to 4, or the fovea could change from stage a to c. Mean evolution time from stage 1 to 2, stage 2 to 3, and 3 to 4 were 20, 12, 3 months, respectively. BCVA decreased over time as stages increased (p = 0.47)., CONCLUSION: The MSS Table displays a new classification, the natural evolution, and practical insights for the management of MTM.

N2  - PURPOSE: To report a case of a unilateral spontaneous filtering bleb dissecting into the cornea in a patient with high myopia., CLINICAL CASE: A 33-year-old woman with high myopia (-18 D) presented with discomfort in the left eye. Ocular history included pars plana vitrectomy and cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in the left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was 0.65 and intraocular pressure was 20 mmHg. Slit-lamp examination showed a filtering bleb in the upper-temporal quadrant, which extended and dissected the proximal cornea without affecting the visual axis. The morphology and content of the bleb was studied with anterior segment optical coherence tomography, which ruled out a corneal-scleral fistulization into the subconjunctival space. The spontaneous filtering bleb was resected surgically. Due to her high myopia, two strips of fascia lata were used to strengthen the area. In the postoperative period, a complete resection of the bleb was confirmed, without apparent leaking points and with a well-vascularized conjunctiva. No complications were noted. The patient maintained the same best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure than before surgery., CONCLUSION: The formation of a spontaneous filtering bleb is a rare entity in patients with high myopia, whose risk increases due to their thinned sclerae. The risk is even greater if they have undergone ocular surgeries. Resection of the filtering bleb in our case halted the progression of the corneal dissection, therefore respecting the transparency of the visual axis and preserving visual acuity.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of Barrett Universal II and Hill-Radial Basis Function with other four popular formulas for the calculation of intraocular lens power in high myopic eyes., METHODS: A total of 56 eyes with an axial length of more than 26.0 mm were retrospectively reviewed. Six intraocular lens power calculation methods, including Barrett Universal II, Hill-Radial Basis Function, SRK/T, Haigis, Holladay 2 and Holladay 1, were evaluated. The difference between the postoperative actual refraction and the refraction predicted by the six methods was evaluated as the prediction error. The absolute prediction error was also calculated., RESULTS: The mean numerical prediction error +/- standard deviation of the six intraocular lens power calculation methods, in order of lowest to highest, was Barrett Universal II (0.37 +/- 0.54 D), Hill-Radial Basis Function (0.40 +/- 0.56 D), SRK/T (0.44 +/- 0.56 D), Haigis (0.53 +/- 0.54 D), Holladay 2 (0.88 +/- 0.62 D) and Holladay 1 (1.00 +/- 0.60 D). The median absolute errors predicted by the Barrett (0.46 D), Hill-Radial Basis Function (0.47 D), SRK/T (0.53 D) and Haigis (0.58 D) were significantly lower than those of the Holladay 1 (0.90 D) and Holladay 2(1.10 D; all p < 0.001). There was no significant difference among the median absolute errors of Barrett, Hill-Radial Basis Function, SRK/T and Haigis (all p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: The prediction errors differed for each method in the selection of intraocular lens power for the long eyes. In terms of overall accuracy, the Barrett Universal II formula provided the lowest prediction error. The Hill-Radial Basis Function method was comparable to the theoretical formulas, such as SRK/T and Haigis.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the agreement between fluorescein angiography and structural optical coherence tomography in diagnosing and monitoring the activity of myopic choroidal neovascularization and to provide a comparative analysis with optical coherence tomography angiography., METHODS: Thirteen patients with active myopic choroidal neovascularization were prospectively enrolled. At the baseline, 2-month, and 6-month visits, each patient underwent a complete ophthalmological examination, including best-corrected visual acuity assessment, fundus examination, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography with structural and angiographic assessment. Sensitivity and specificity for all optical coherence tomography parameters were evaluated taking fluorescein angiography as the reference examination., RESULTS: At the baseline, fluorescein angiography confirmed myopic choroidal neovascularization leakage in all patients. Structural optical coherence tomography demonstrated intraretinal or subretinal fluid in 61% of cases, fuzzy borders and absence of external limiting membrane visibility in 84% of cases, and subretinal hyperreflective exudation in 53% of cases. Sensitivity to the presence of retinal fluid and subretinal hyperreflective exudation was lower than sensitivity to fuzzy borders and external limiting membrane visibility, which reached 84%. During ranibizumab therapy, external limiting membrane visibility showed a higher sensitivity (100%) compared with fuzzy borders and subretinal hyperreflective exudation (66.6%) while displaying an equal specificity of 100%. At baseline and final visit, sensitivity increased to 100% when all structural optical coherence tomography parameters were pooled. Optical coherence tomography angiography detected myopic choroidal neovascularization at baseline, 2-month, and 6-month visits in 92%, 76%, and 76% of cases, respectively., CONCLUSION: The study confirms that the new indicators of myopic choroidal neovascularization activity are more reliable than the presence or absence of retinal fluid. Optical coherence tomography angiography identified myopic choroidal neovascularization in most patients in the diagnostic phase and during treatment monitoring and could be considered as an alternative to fluorescein angiography in selected patients.

N2  - Purpose: To characterize longitudinal changes in macular microvasculature as quantified from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) metrics in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) eyes with and without high myopia., Methods: In total, 63 and 61 POAG eyes with and without high myopia, respectively, underwent swept-source OCTA imaging in at least four follow-up visits at an ophthalmic center, with a scanning protocol of 3- x 3-mm centered at the fovea. The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, FAZ circularity, and vessel density (VD) in both the superficial (SCP) and deep capillary plexuses (DCP) were measured. The rate of change in macular OCTA metrics over time was estimated using linear mixed-effects models in both groups of POAG eyes., Results: The mean follow-up time and number of visits were 27.72 +/- 8.57 months and 8.5 (8 to 13) times, and 30.95 +/- 10.19 months and 10 (8-13) times in POAG eyes with and without high myopia, respectively. VD in the DCP reduced significantly more quickly in POAG eyes with high myopia than in those without high myopia (-5.14%/year vs. -3.71%/year, P = 0.008). Moreover, lower baseline VD in the DCP was significantly associated with faster VD reduction in POAG with high myopia eyes (P < 0.001). Conversely, the VD reduction rate in the SCP, FAZ area, and FAZ circularity in both the SCP and DCP were similar in both groups (all Ps > 0.05)., Conclusions: VD in DCP reduced significantly more quickly in POAG eyes with high myopia over time. Density in the DCP reduced more quickly when baseline VD was low.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risks that might be associated with recurrent macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) after silicone oil (S.O) removal in myopic patients with open flat macular hole (MH)., METHODS: In this retrospective series, we assessed the different factors that might be associated with recurrent MHRD after S.O removal in 48 eyes with open flat MH that underwent S.O removal after successful MHRD repair. We divided the enrolled eyes into 2 groups: group 1 included 38 eyes with flat open MH and flat retina after S.O removal, and group 2 included 10 eyes with flat open MH and recurrent MHRD after S.O removal., RESULTS: Ten of 48 eyes (20.8%) with open flat MH developed recurrent MHRD after S.O removal. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that MH at the apex of PS, MH minimum diameter, hole form factor (HFF), and MH index (MHI) were significant risk factors for recurrent MHRD after S.O removal in myopic patients with open flat MH., CONCLUSIONS: If there is a "flat open" MH that is large, located at the apex of PS, or with an HHF or MHI <0.9-0.5, there is a high chance of recurrent MHRD after S.O removal.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of age at treatment and other factors on treatment response to atropine in the Low-Concentration Atropine for Myopia Progression (LAMP) Study., DESIGN: Secondary analysis from a randomized trial., PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred fifty children aged 4 to 12 years who originally were assigned to receive 0.05%, 0.025%, or 0.01% atropine or placebo once daily, and who completed 2 years of the LAMP Study, were included. In the second year, the placebo group was switched to the 0.05% atropine group., METHODS: Potential predictive factors for change in spherical equivalent (SE) and axial length (AL) over 2 years were evaluated by generalized estimating equations in each treatment group. Evaluated factors included age at treatment, gender, baseline refraction, parental myopia, time outdoors, diopter hours of near work, and treatment compliance. Estimated mean values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of change in SE and AL over 2 years also were generated., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Factors associated with SE change and AL change over 2 years were the primary outcome measures. Associated factors during the first year were secondary outcome measures., RESULTS: In 0.05%, 0.025%, and 0.01% atropine groups, younger age was the only factor associated with SE progression (coefficient of 0.14, 0.15, and 0.20, respectively) and AL elongation (coefficient of -0.10, -0.11, and -0.12, respectively) over 2 years; the younger the age, the poorer the response. At each year of age from 4 to 12 years across the treatment groups, higher-concentration atropine showed a better treatment response, following a concentration-dependent effect (Ptrend <0.05 for each age group). In addition, the mean SE progression in 6-year-old children receiving 0.05% atropine (-0.90 diopter [D]; 95% CI, -0.99 to -0.82) was similar to that of 8-year-old children receiving 0.025% atropine (-0.89 D; 95% CI, -0.94 to -0.83) and 10-year-old children receiving 0.01% atropine (-0.92 D; 95% CI, -0.99 to -0.85). All concentrations were well tolerated in all age groups., CONCLUSIONS: Younger age is associated with poor treatment response to low-concentration atropine at 0.05%, 0.025%, and 0.01%. Among concentrations studied, younger children required the highest 0.05% concentration to achieve similar reduction in myopic progression as older children receiving lower concentrations.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pathological myopia (PM) is the seventh leading cause of blindness, with a reported global prevalence up to 3%. Early and automated PM detection from fundus images could aid to prevent blindness in a world population that is characterized by a rising myopia prevalence. We aim to assess the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the detection of PM and semantic segmentation of myopia-induced lesions from fundus images on a recently introduced reference data set., METHODS: This investigation reports on the results of CNNs developed for the recently introduced Pathological Myopia (PALM) dataset, which consists of 1200 images. Our CNN bundles lesion segmentation and PM classification, as the two tasks are heavily intertwined. Domain knowledge is also inserted through the introduction of a new Optic Nerve Head (ONH)-based prediction enhancement for the segmentation of atrophy and fovea localization. Finally, we are the first to approach fovea localization using segmentation instead of detection or regression models. Evaluation metrics include area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for PM detection, Euclidean distance for fovea localization, and Dice and F1 metrics for the semantic segmentation tasks (optic disc, retinal atrophy and retinal detachment)., RESULTS: Models trained with 400 available training images achieved an AUC of 0.9867 for PM detection, and a Euclidean distance of 58.27 pixels on the fovea localization task, evaluated on a test set of 400 images. Dice and F1 metrics for semantic segmentation of lesions scored 0.9303 and 0.9869 on optic disc, 0.8001 and 0.9135 on retinal atrophy, and 0.8073 and 0.7059 on retinal detachment, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: We report a successful approach for a simultaneous classification of pathological myopia and segmentation of associated lesions. Our work was acknowledged with an award in the context of the "Pathological Myopia detection from retinal images" challenge held during the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (April 2019). Considering that (pathological) myopia cases are often identified as false positives and negatives in glaucoma deep learning models, we envisage that the current work could aid in future research to discriminate between glaucomatous and highly-myopic eyes, complemented by the localization and segmentation of landmarks such as fovea, optic disc and atrophy.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the methodology and pilot data of the Shanghai Child and Adolescent Large-scale Eye Study (SCALE-HM)., METHODS: This is a population-based, prospective, examiner-masked study with annual follow-up. Patients are 4- to 18-year-olds with high myopia. The participants will fill out questionnaires and then undergo visual acuity, axial length (AL), intraocular pressure, ophthalmologist assessment, microperimetry, cycloplegic refraction, Pentacam, wavefront aberration, fundus, blood and saliva examinations. To describe the pilot data, intergroup differences were assessed with t-tests or analysis of variance and a logistic regression model was used to determine the independent factors associated with peripapillary atrophy (PPA)., RESULTS: Overall, 134 eyes of 79 participants met the pilot study recruitment criteria. The mean AL and spherical equivalent were 26.91 +/- 1.07 mm and -9.40 +/- 1.77 D, respectively. Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) (N = 112) and tessellated fundus (N = 67) were the most common fundus changes. The mean AL was significantly longer in PPA (27.08 +/- 0.93 mm) than in non-PPA eyes (26.06 +/- 1.31 mm; p < 0.001). Axial length (AL) (p = 0.041) was the only independent factor associated with PPA. Axial length (AL) was significantly longer in eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (N = 11; 28.02 +/- 1.31 mm) than without myopic retinal lesions (N = 56; 26.48 +/- 0.91 mm, p < 0.001) or with tessellated fundus (N = 67; 27.09 +/- 0.97 mm, p = 0.012). The myopic degree was higher in eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy than without myopic retinal lesions (-10.51 +/- 2.76 D versus -9.06 +/- 1.58 D, p = 0.039)., CONCLUSION: Peripapillary atrophy and tessellated fundus were common in children and adolescents with high myopia. Results from this prospective study will help to understand the mechanisms, development and prognosis of these changes and can guide early myopia screening. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Complications from pathologic myopia (PM) are a major cause of visual impairment and blindness. However, an efficient clinical therapeutic strategy for PM is still lacking. The aim of this study was to quantitatively compare the proteomic profiles of aqueous humor between PM and non-PM cataract patients. Twenty aqueous humor samples from each group were analyzed with label-free quantitative proteomic analysis to identify the differentially expressed proteins for function enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction network construction. Hub protein was validated with ELISA using an independent cohort consisting of 20 samples from each group and its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted. A total of 583 proteins were identified and 101 proteins were found to be differentially expressed, including 63 up-regulated proteins and 38 down-regulated proteins. The bioinformatics analysis suggested that PM is closely associated with immunity and inflammation interactions, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA1) was enriched as the hub protein of the network with the highest score, degree and centrality. ROC analysis showed that ApoA1 could distinguish PM from controls with an area under the curve of 0.963 (p < 0.001). The findings could provide potential clues for further study on the molecular mechanisms and developing new treatments for PM, especially related to immunity and inflammation interactions. ApoA1 may be a potential key protein and therapeutic target in human PM. SIGNIFICANCE: It is important and urgent to discover the mechanisms of pathologic myopia (PM) to inhibit its progression. This study applied the quantitative proteomic analysis to study aqueous humor from patients with or without PM, aiming to discover dysregulated proteins related to PM. Our results suggested that those dysregulated proteins are closely associated with immunity and inflammation interactions, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. The findings from this study could provide potential clues for further research on the molecular mechanisms and developing new treatments for PM, especially related to immunity and inflammation. ApoA1 may be a potential key protein and therapeutic target in human PM. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - The emerging ultra-wide field of view (UWF) fundus color imaging is a powerful tool for fundus screening. However, manual screening is labor-intensive and subjective. Based on 2644 UWF images, a set of early fundus abnormal screening system named DeepUWF is developed. DeepUWF includes an abnormal fundus screening subsystem and a disease diagnosis subsystem for three kinds of fundus diseases (retinal tear & retinal detachment, diabetic retinopathy and pathological myopia). The components in the system are composed of a set of excellent convolutional neural networks and two custom classifiers. However, the contrast of UWF images used in the research is low, which seriously limits the extraction of fine features of UWF images by depth model. Therefore, the high specificity and low sensitivity of prediction results have always been difficult problems in research. In order to solve this problem, six kinds of image preprocessing techniques are adopted, and their effects on the prediction performance of fundus abnormal and three kinds of fundus diseases models are studied. A variety of experimental indicators are used to evaluate the algorithms for validity and reliability. The experimental results show that these preprocessing methods are helpful to improve the learning ability of the networks and achieve good sensitivity and specificity. Without ophthalmologists, DeepUWF has potential application value, which is helpful for fundus health screening and workflow improvement.

N2  - PRCIS: Postoperative suprachoroidal hemorrhage (PSCH) is an infrequent but devastating complication after nonvalved aqueous drainage implant surgery and demonstrated a bimodal distribution. The final outcomes of either conservative management or surgical drainage of the hemorrhage remained poor., PURPOSE: The aim was to report the incidence and outcomes of eyes developing PSCH after undergoing Aurolab aqueous drainage implant (AADI) surgery for adult and pediatric refractory glaucomas., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective series, case files of all patients who underwent AADI between May 2012 and December 2019 were retrieved from an electronic database. A PSCH was defined as the presence of hemorrhagic choroidal detachment, confirmed by ultrasound B scan, occurring in a closed system in the postoperative period., RESULTS: Of the 986 eyes that underwent AADI during the study period, 7 (0.7%), developed PSCH (95% confidence interval=0.3-1.6%). There were no differences in the preoperative parameters between those with and without PSCH. Of these, 4 were seen in pediatric eyes (4/288, 1.4%) and 3 in adult eyes (3/698, 0.4%) (P<0.01). Four eyes (57%) had PSCH in the immediate postoperative period (ie, between 24 and 48 h of AADI surgery), while the remaining 3 had onset ranging from 6 to 7 weeks after surgery. Anatomic risk factors were present in all eyes including hypotony (n=4), myopia (n=3), microcornea (n=2), microphthalmos (n=1), postvitrectomy (n=1), and staphyloma (n=1). Visual acuity improved in only 1 (14%) eye while 3 (43%) eyes developed phthisis bulbi, all in the pediatric age group., CONCLUSIONS: PSCH is a rare complication following AADI and is seen in <1% eyes. The incidence is higher in the pediatric age group. Visual and anatomic outcomes are dismal following PSCH with globe salvage possible in only about half these eyes.

N2  - PURPOSE: To identify prognostic factors for axial length (AL) elongation and incidence of posterior staphyloma (PS) in adult Japanese patients with high myopia., DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study., METHODS: Six-year follow-up data for 345 patients (620 eyes with AL >= 26.5 mm and spherical equivalent [SE] <=- 8.00 diopters) admitted to the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital from 2007 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Main outcome measures were change in AL from baseline, factors associated with AL, categorization of eyes with high myopia, factors associated with incidence of PS, and impact of PS on myopic maculopathy and visual function., RESULTS: The mean annual increase in AL was 0.03 mm. Presence of optic nerve disc conus (P = .025), steeper corneal curvature, lower SE, and decreased choroidal thickness (CT) (all P < .001) were associated with increased AL in univariate and multivariate analyses. Younger age (P = .003) and no use of intraocular pressure-lowering medications (P = .046) were associated with increased AL. Eyes with high myopia were categorized using factor analysis as associated with glaucoma, severe pathologic myopia, and mild-to-moderate pathologic myopia. Older age, increased AL, glaucoma, and choroidal thinning (all P <= .001) were identified as significant risk factors for the incidence of PS in univariate and/or multivariate analyses. Incidence of PS was a precursor for myopic maculopathy and visual field defects., CONCLUSIONS: Optic nerve disc conus, steeper corneal curvature, lower SE, decreased CT, and no use of intraocular pressure-lowering medications were prognostic factors for increased AL. Older age, increased AL, glaucoma, and decreased CT were prognostic factors for PS. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina (GA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by nyctalopia, myopia, sharply demarcated expanding peripheral chorioretinal atrophic lesions, early cataract, progressive visual loss and hyperornithinemia. Only three cases of GA associated with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD) have been reported. The genotype-phenotype correlation of RRD in GA is limited by lack of genetic information in the previously reported cases. Here we report two young sisters with a characteristic GA phenotype associated with a novel variant in the ornithine aminotransferase gene (OAT), in whom one developed unilateral RRD at the age of 9 years. Materials and Methods: Retrospective report of two cases including genetic analysis and multimodal retinal imaging. Results: A 9-year-old Saudi girl presented with a funnel-shaped RRD, extensive proliferative vitreoretinopathy, peripheral choroidal detachment and neovascular glaucoma in her right eye. Fundus examination of her left eye showed an attached retina with sharply-demarcated peripheral chorioretinal atrophic patches suggestive of GA. Whole exome sequencing confirmed GA by revealing a homozygous c.980 C > G (p. Pro327Arg) variant in exon 8 of OAT. The RRD was inoperable. The chorioretinal lesions in the left eye enlarged slowly over 3 years of follow up. Examination of the proband's older sister revealed a similar but more advanced GA phenotype in both eyes. Conclusions: A characteristic GA phenotype associated with a novel variant in OAT is reported. This variant might be associated with childhood-onset RRD in the proband.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate morphological differences between two types of Bruch's membrane (BM) defects-patchy atrophy (PA) and CNV-related macular atrophy (CNV-MA) METHODS: Eyes presenting with PA or CNV-MA were included. Scleral thickness (ST), choroidal thickness (CT), and scleral morphological characteristics were obtained by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Fundus photographs were performed to measure the size of PA and CNV-MA lesions., RESULTS: Among a total of 167 eyes evaluated, 106 eyes had PA and 61 eyes had CNV-MA. In addition, dome-shaped macula (DSM) was identified in 20 (18.87%) and 10 (16.39%) eyes among PA and CNV-MA, respectively. The eyes of CNV-MA without DSM showed a thicker subfoveal ST (278.61 +/- 56.17 vs 231.58 +/- 66.09 mm, P < 0.001), a thinner subfoveal CT, and a higher rate of scleral perforating vessels (70.6% vs 50.0%, P = 0.021) when compared with those of PA without DSM. The size of PA/CNV-MA lesions was associated with CT in eyes without DSM. However, it was only associated with bulge height in eyes with DSM (r = 0.5, P = 0.013)., CONCLUSIONS: The eyes with CNV-MA had a thicker sclera than those with PA, which add another evidence to indicate the absence of the progressive relationship between two types of BM defects. The enlargement of lesions in BM defects between eyes with and without DSM may be caused by different mechanical forces. SS-OCT, which focuses on scleral and choroid morphology, may be necessary for more accurate classification of pathologic myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether progressive macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning are predictive for detecting visual field (VF) progression in eyes with high myopia., DESIGN: Cohort study., METHODS: A total of 104 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) eyes with high myopia and 104 age- and VF severity-matched POAG eyes without high myopia (mean follow-up, 5.4 years) were included. High myopia was defined as a spherical equivalent <-6.0 diopters or axial length >26.5 mm. Progressive GCIPL, RNFL, and VF deterioration were determined by Guided Progression Analysis (GPA) in optical coherence tomography and standard automated perimetry. The risk of VF progression was evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models., RESULTS: Highly myopic eyes with progressive GCIPL thinning had a significantly higher risk of developing VF progression after adjusting for the baseline intraocular pressure (HR 4.00; P = .001) or peak intraocular pressure (HR 3.11; P = .011) in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model, whereas highly myopic eyes with progressive RNFL thinning were not significantly associated with VF progression. In eyes without high myopia, both progressive GCIPL (HR 4.67 or 3.62; P = .008 or .037, respectively) and RNFL (HR 6.60 or 3.97; P = .001 or .016, respectively) thinning were associated with a significantly higher risk of developing VF progression after adjusting for the baseline or peak intraocular pressure., CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring macular GCIPL thickness was effective for predicting glaucoma progression regardless of the presence of high myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the accuracy of artificial intelligence formulas (Kane formula and Radial Basis Function [RBF] 2.0) and other formulas, including the original and modified Wang-Koch (MWK) adjustment formulas for Holladay 1 (H1-MWK) and SRK/T (SRK/T-WK and SRK/T-MWK), the Barrett Universal II (BUII), the emmetropia-verifying optical (EVO), and the Haigis equation in highly myopic eyes., DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive case-series study., METHODS: A total of 370 eyes with an axial length (AL) >=26.0 mm of 370 patients were enrolled, and subgroup analyses was performed based on ALs. The median absolute error (MedAE), the percentages of eyes with hyperopic outcome and within +/-0.25 diopters (D), +/-0.50 D, and +/-1.00 D of prediction error were determined., RESULTS: Overall, the Kane equation had the lowest MedAE (0.26 D), followed by H1-WK (0.27 D) and H1-MWK (0.28 D). There were no significant differences in MedAE among the Kane equation, the RBF 2.0, the BUII, the H1-MWK, and the H1-WK, whereas the Kane equation had a significantly lower MedAE than EVO (P < .001), SRK/T-MWK (P = .001), SRK/T-WK (P = .006), and Haigis (P < .001). In extremely myopic eyes with an AL >=30.0 mm (n = 115), the Kane equation had a significantly lower MedAE than the RBF 2.0 (P = .001), the EVO (P = .019), the BUII (P = .013), and the Haigis method (P = .005), whereas no significant differences were found among the Kane, H1-MWK, and H1-WK equations., CONCLUSIONS: The Kane equation was comparable to RBF 2.0, BUII, H1-MWK, and H1-WK in highly myopic eyes and was better than RBF 2.0 and BUII in extremely myopic eyes. The Kane, H1-MWK, and H1-WK methods were equally accurate in eyes with high to extreme myopia. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - AIMS: To determine the prevalence and predictors of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in a consortium of Asian studies., METHODS: Individual-level data from 19 885 participants from four population-based studies, and 1379 highly myopic participants (defined as axial length (AL) >26.0 mm) from three clinic-based/school-based studies of the Asian Eye Epidemiology Consortium were pooled. MMD was graded from fundus photographs following the meta-analysis for pathologic myopia classification and defined as the presence of diffuse choroidal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, with or without 'plus' lesion (lacquer crack, choroidal neovascularisation or Fuchs' spot). Area under the curve (AUC) evaluation for predictors was performed for the population-based studies., RESULTS: The prevalence of MMD was 0.4%, 0.5%, 1.5% and 5.2% among Asians in rural India, Beijing, Russia and Singapore, respectively. In the population-based studies, older age (per year; OR=1.13), female (OR=2.0), spherical equivalent (SE; per negative diopter; OR=1.7), longer AL (per mm; OR=3.1) and lower education (OR=1.9) were associated with MMD after multivariable adjustment (all p<0.001). Similarly, in the clinic-based/school-based studies, older age (OR=1.07; p<0.001), female (OR=2.1; p<0.001), longer AL (OR=2.1; p<0.001) and lower education (OR=1.7; p=0.005) were associated with MMD after multivariable adjustment. SE had the highest AUC of 0.92, followed by AL (AUC=0.87). The combination of SE, age, education and gender had a marginally higher AUC (0.94)., CONCLUSION: In this pooled analysis of multiple Asian studies, older age, female, lower education, greater myopia severity and longer AL were risk factors of MMD, and myopic SE was the strongest single predictor of MMD.

N2  - AIMS: To investigate the progression pattern of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (DCA) among Chinese participants with high myopia., METHODS: This is a longitudinal, non-interventional study. Participants with high myopia, defined as <=-6 diopters spherical power, were included and followed up for 4 years, and underwent cycloplegic autorefraction, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and fundus photography examinations. Newly established DCA, enlargement of existing DCA and development of other lesions of myopic maculopathy were regarded as DCA progression., RESULTS: Of the 484 participants with a mean age of 21.5+/-12.7 years (range, 6.8-69.7 years), 68 eyes (14.0%) showed DCA progression, with 88 lesion changes. The first appearance of DCA was identified in 21 eyes (23.9%). Of 88 eyes with DCA at baseline, 47 eyes (53.4%) showed progression, with 67 lesion changes, including 45 eyes (67.2%) with enlargement of DCA, 17 (25.3%) with a first appearance of lacquer cracks, 4 (6.0%) with development of patchy chorioretinal atrophy and 1 (1.5%) with increased numbers of lacquer cracks. Longer axial length (p<0.001), baseline DCA (p=0.005) and baseline DCA closer to the fovea (p=0.013) predicted DCA progression. Eyes had poorer BCVA at the follow-up if DCA was enlarging (p<0.001) or DCA was closer to the fovea at baseline (p=0.028) after adjusting for age,gender and cataract., CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the participants with DCA had progression over a 4-year follow-up. Enlargement and newly developed DCA were common progression patterns. Larger areas of DCA and foveal involvement with DCA could be indicators of a worse BCVA later.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate potential changes in myopia prevalence in Denmark by revising more than 100 years of myopia research., METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. Only studies reporting a myopia prevalence in Denmark were included. Myopia was defined using the definition in individual references. We did not restrict inclusion of studies to specific methods of measuring or evaluating refraction. As refraction changes throughout life, information from available studies was divided in relevant age groups. Chi-squared test was used when analysing the effect of sex and education on myopia prevalence except when the expected values were beneath 5, where Fisher's exact test was used. To further compare the effect of sex, we calculated the odds ratio of being myopic for females compared to males., RESULTS: We identified 29 Danish studies reporting on prevalence of myopia. The studies were performed between year 1882 and 2018. We found no strong evidence of an increase in myopia prevalence in Denmark. Increasing age was associated with an increased myopia prevalence up to the age of 60 years where after the prevalence decreased. Longer education and more intensive educational load were associated with myopia. Fourteen studies compared the prevalence of myopia between males and females and two of these studies found a significant higher prevalence in females., CONCLUSION: We evaluated nearly 140 years of myopia research in Denmark and did not find a convincing change in prevalence of myopia which is in contrast to the high prevalence of myopia reported in some parts of the world and the expected rise in myopia as predicted by WHO.

N2  - PURPOSE: To report the surgical outcome and postoperative hypopigmented change around fovea among patients with high myopia who received human amniotic membrane (hAM) graft transplantation for macular hole (MH)., METHOD: This retrospective, interventional case series included 10 eyes of 10 consecutive patients (5 (50%) male) with high myopia (axial length over 26.5 mm) who received hAM graft to treat persisted or chronic MH with or without retinal detachment in two hospitals. Postoperative parafoveal atrophy was identified with colour fundus picture and structure optical coherent tomography. Baseline characteristics and short-term visual outcome were analysed., RESULTS: The preoperative mean (+/-SD) axial length and MH diameter were 29.9 (+/-1.8) mm and 881.8 (+/-438.5) mum, respectively. After hAM transplantation, seven (70%) eyes had complete MH closure and the mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved from 1.26 (+/-0.48) logarithm of minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) before operation to 1.11 (+/-0.44) logMAR on the last visit (p=0.074). Patchy atrophy-like depigmentation developed around the MH lesion in four (40.0%) eyes as early as in the first month after surgery. None of them had visual worsening. In terms of demographics, axial length, MH size, ocular history, preoperative BCVA and postoperative BCVA, there was no significant difference between those with and without the parafoveal atrophy. No graft rejection and inflammation happened during the follow-up., CONCLUSION: Parafovea atrophy, a rare complication in the conventional MH surgery, was observed in 40% of eyes with highly myopic MH after hAM graft transplantation. The pathogenesis and long-term consequence need further investigations. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine most postequatorial retina in eyes with myopic macular retinoschisis (MRS) by ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and to determine whether paravascular vitreal adhesions play a role in the development of MRS., DESIGN: Retrospective single-center observational case series., PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty highly myopic participants who were older than 50 years with and without an MRS were studied. High myopia was defined as an eye with an axial length of more than 26.5 mm., METHODS: All participants underwent UWF OCT imaging with a scan width of 23 mm and a depth of 5 mm using a prototype swept-source OCT device. The vitreoretinal adhesions to the foveal retina and retinal vessels and paravascular abnormalities, including paravascular retinal cysts, paravascular retinoschisis, and paravascular lamellar holes, were analyzed in the UWF OCT images. The findings in eyes with an MRS were compared with those in eyes without an MRS., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationships between MRS and vitreal adhesions to the retinal vessels or to the fovea were determined., RESULTS: An MRS was found in 49 of the 150 eyes (33%). Vitreal adhesions to the retinal vessels were found more frequently in eyes with an MRS than in eyes without an MRS (63% vs. 44%; P = 0.04). In contrast, the number of eyes with adhesions to the fovea in eyes with an MRS was not significantly different from that in eyes without an MRS (57% vs. 59%). Paravascular lesions, for example, retinal cysts, retinoschisis, and lamellar holes, were more common in eyes with an MRS than in eyes without an MRS (71% vs. 36%, 61% vs. 17 %, and 20% vs. 8% [P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.03], respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of paravascular vitreal adhesions was a significant predictor for MRS development (odds ratio, 2.56; P = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Paravascular vitreal adhesions may be related to the development of the different types of paravascular lesions including retinal cysts and retinoschisis, and play a more important role in the development of an MRS than vitreal adhesions to the fovea.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of posterior staphyloma using wide-field optical coherence tomography (WF-OCT) in adults with high myopia in Singapore., DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study., METHODS: Adults with spherical equivalent (SE) <= -5D in either eye at the first visit of Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study and Singapore Prospective Study Program study were recruited. Posterior staphyloma was diagnosed using WF-OCT (PLEX R Elite9000, Carl Zeiss Meditec). Myopic macular degeneration (MMD), myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) were assessed using fundus photographs, DRI-Triton OCT (Topcon) and the Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI) questionnaire, respectively. Factors associated with posterior staphyloma were identified with multilevel, multivariable logistic regression. Impact of posterior staphyloma on MMD, MTM and visual function was analysed with multilevel, multivariable logistic regression and linear mixed model, respectively., RESULTS: Among the 225 eyes [mean SE = -6.5 +/- 2.2 D, mean axial length (AL) = 26.2 +/- 1.5 mm] of 117 participants (mean age = 60.3 +/- 7.1 years), posterior staphyloma was detected in 47 (20.9%) eyes of 38 (32.5%) participants. Older age [odds ratio (OR), 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.26], more myopic SE (0.63; 0.51-0.77) and increased AL (2.51; 1.69-3.73) were associated with higher prevalence of posterior staphyloma (all p < 0.001). Adults with posterior staphyloma had higher odds of MMD (2.67; 1.23-5.82; p = 0.013), MTM (3.79; 1.13-12.68; p = 0.031) and worse IVI Reading (beta = -1.44; -2.31 to 0.58; p = 0.001) scores., CONCLUSIONS: About one in three adults with high myopia had posterior staphyloma, which was associated with increased odds of having myopic maculopathy and a detrimental impact on VRQoL.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study aims to determine the probability of progression of myopic maculopathy according to age., METHODS: This is a longitudinal observational study of single-center retrospective cohort of Caucasian patients formed by 212 consecutive adults with high myopia. Main outcome measures were age, visual acuity (VA), refractive error (RE), follow-up time, and the macular status assessed at least 5 years apart according to the Meta-Analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group. The progression rate was calculated based on per 1000 eyes/year. Multistate models were fitted to identify the predictive factors and to calculate the most probable age of progression onset using the Aalen-Johansen estimator., RESULTS: We studied 220 eyes of 122 Caucasian patients. Mean age was 48.18 +/- 14.1, mean follow-up 12.73 +/- 5.81 years. One-hundred and fifty-two (69.1%) eyes progressed of category, and 96 (44%) worsened a mean of 0.3 logMAR units during follow-up. The progression rate was 32.21/1000 eyes/year. The probability of progressing increased with age; it was higher in women if there was a family history of myopia, worse VA, higher RE, or wide macular staphyloma. The probability of progressing from category 1 was > 0.6 after 70 years of age; from category 2, it was 0.7 after 70 years; and 0.5 from category 3 after 75 years. If choroidal neovascularization (CNV) appeared, this probability exceeded 0.7 between ages 45 and 55 for all categories., CONCLUSION: The progression rate is lower than in a Japanese series. The vision worsened with disease progression, and the probability of both happening increased after the age of 70-75. If CNV appears, the risk of progression is very high at the age of 45-55.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the associations of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SNTB1 gene with high myopia in a Han Chinese population., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on previous studies, four SNPs from the SNTB1 gene were chosen for genotyping. This is a case-control genetic association study comprising 193 high myopia participants and 135 normal emmetropic controls from a Han Chinese population. Allelic frequencies of the SNPs and haplotypes were compared to assess the associations of the SNPs with high myopia and axial length (AL)., RESULTS: The SNPs rs7839488 (effect allele: A; OR = 0.685), rs4395927 (effect allele: T; OR = 0.692), and rs6469937 (effect allele: A; OR = 0.683) displayed significant associations with high myopia initially (P = .044, 0.049, and 0.035, respectively), but did not withstand permutation testing (all Ppermutation>0.05). rs6469937 displayed associations with high myopia in the dominant model (AG+AA: OR = 0.609) against GG (reference). rs6469937 was also associated with AL in the dominant model (AG+AA: Beta = -0.58) against GG (reference). The haplotype analysis demonstrated ATGA as the protective haplotype against high myopia, which remained statistically significant in permutation testing (Ppermutation = 0.045)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are suggestive that SNTB1 is associated with high myopia in a Han Chinese population.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the characteristics, risk factors and visual impact of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) among adults with myopia in Singapore., METHODS: We analysed 3316 myopic eyes of adults aged over 40 years who participated in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases-2 study. Detailed questionnaires and ophthalmic examinations were conducted. A total of 2913 myopic eyes of 1639 subjects were graded for MTM by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. MTM is defined as the presence of retinoschisis, lamellar or full-thickness macula hole and foveal retinal detachment. Fundus photographs were graded for myopic macular degeneration (MMD)., RESULTS: Of these 2913 myopic eyes, the mean and SD of age was 60.1+/-8.0 years; the spherical equivalent (SE) was -2.5+/-2.3 D; and the axial length (AL) was 24.6+/-1.3 mm. MTM was found in 0.9% of myopic eyes and 7.3% of highly myopic eyes. In the multivariate analysis, myopic SE (p<0.001), longer AL (p<0.001), MMD (p=0.01) and epiretinal traction (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for MTM. MTM was not associated with age (p=0.38). MTM was significantly associated with poorer best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (p<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Our population-based study revealed that MTM was present in 0.9% of myopic eyes and 7.3% of highly myopic eyes. While greater myopic SE, longer AL, MMD and epiretinal traction are risk factors of MTM, age was not related to MTM. MTM has a negative effect on BCVA.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To describe the clinical presentation and characteristic imaging features of deep retinal haemorrhages primarily located in the Henle fibre layer (HFL) of the macula. The spectrum of aetiologies and a comprehensive theory of pathogenesis are presented., METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicentre case series evaluating eyes with retinal haemorrhage in HFL. Clinical features, underlying aetiology, systemic and ocular risk factors, visual acuity, and multimodal imaging including fundus photography and cross-sectional and en face optical coherence tomography (OCT) are presented., RESULTS: Retinal haemorrhages localised to HFL in 33 eyes from 23 patients were secondary to acute blunt trauma to the head (n=2), eye (n=1) and trunk (n=1), ruptured intracranial aneurysm (Terson's syndrome, n=3), general anaesthesia (n=1), epidural anaesthesia (n=1), hypertension with anaemia (n=1), decompression retinopathy (n=1), postvitrectomy with intraocular gas (n=1), retinal vein occlusion (n=7), myopic degeneration (n=2), macular telangiectasia type 2 (n=1), and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (n=1). Defining clinical features included deep retinal haemorrhage with feathery margin and petaloid pattern radiating from the fovea. OCT demonstrated characteristic hyper-reflectivity from the haemorrhage delineated by obliquely oriented fibres in the Henle layer. Spontaneous resolution of HFL haemorrhage occurred after 3 months in 15 patients with follow-up., CONCLUSION: The characteristic petaloid-shaped, deep intraretinal haemorrhage with a feathery margin localised to HFL is associated with various disorders. The terminology 'Henle fiber layer hemorrhage (HH)' is proposed to describe the clinical and OCT findings, which may result from abnormal retinal venous pressure from systemic or local retinovascular disorders affecting the deep capillary plexus or from choroidal vascular abnormalities.

N2  - Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) is a non-invasive imaging modality for assessing the vasculature within ocular structures including the retina, macula, choroid and optic nerve. OCT-A has a wide range of clinical applications in various optometric conditions which have been independently reported in the literature. This paper aims to present a review of the current literature on the clinical application of OCT-A in optometric practice as well as to analyse and evaluate the quality of the available evidence. This review included 78 articles from a literature search conducted on 26 May 2019 across the following databases: Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science. Primary ocular pathologies discussed in this review include glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, myopia, acquired and congenital macular dystrophies, epiretinal membrane, retinal vein occlusion, retinitis pigmentosa, choroidal melanoma, uveitis, central serous chorioretinopathy, amblyopia and optic neuropathies. Primary outcome variables included vessel density, foveal avascular zone area and diameter, flow velocity and flow index. This review aims to evaluate the evidence available for OCT-A applications in diagnosis and prognosis of ocular conditions in an optometric setting.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the incidence, clinical features and predictive risk factors of subretinal fibrosis after treatment of active myopic choroidal neovascularisation (mCNV) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)., METHODS: This post-hoc analysis of a randomised controlled trial included a total of 54 patients with active mCNV. The clinical data at baseline, month 3 and month 12 were used. Fundus photography and optical coherence tomography at month 3 were used to determine the presence of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy, and its incidence was calculated. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Visual Function Questionnaire-25 score, macular integrity index (MI) and their changes were compared between eyes with and without subretinal fibrosis. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the risk factors of subretinal fibrosis., RESULTS: Subretinal fibrosis occurred in 22 of 54 eyes with mCNV. Patients with subretinal fibrosis achieved similar BCVA improvement in comparison with those without fibrosis at 3 and 12 months after the treatment; however, they had lower visual acuity, more subfoveal CNV (p=0.002), higher CNV thickness at baseline (p=0.016), larger CNV size (p=0.030), larger leakage area (p=0.021) and higher presence of advanced myopic maculopathy (p=0.035). Age <45 years, BCVA <60 ETDRS letters, and MI index <20 at baseline were the predictors for subretinal fibrosis occurrence in a logistic regression model., CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy was 40.7% in eyes with mCNV. Age, baseline BCVA and MI index could serve as predictive risk factors of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF treatment in patients with mCNV. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Myopic maculopathy and glaucoma belong to the most common causes of irreversible blindness worldwide and, having an ocular axial elongation as one of their main risk factors, can occur together. The detection of glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) in highly myopic eyes is clinically and technically difficult, and there is no information available, neither about the natural course of GON or about the course of GON under intraocular pressure-lowering therapy. We therefore designed this study to explore the natural course of GON in highly myopic eyes., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this single-centred longitudinal registry cohort study, 813 highly myopic individuals will be recruited and undergo detailed ophthalmic examinations. High myopia is defined by a myopic refractive error of >=-6 D or an axial length of >=26.5 mm. GON is defined by a glaucomatous appearance of the optic nerve head or glaucomatous visual field (VF) defects. GON progression is defined by either change of the optic disc or VF., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the ethical committee of the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC), Sun Yat-sen University, China (ID: 2019KYPJ079). All the participants are required to provide informed consents. Results will be disseminated through scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. The data will be deposited at the clinical research centre in ZOC using electronic data capture system, and a copy of paper files will also be kept. Only members of the project team will have access to these data., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04302220. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

N2  - AIMS: To compare the value of pre-treatment axial elongation (AE) and changes in refractive sphere (M change) for predicting the success in orthokeratology (ortho-k), in order to better identify suitable candidates for myopia control., METHODS: This study further analysed the data of 66 subjects receiving 7-month ortho-k treatment, following a 7-month observation period, during which single-vision spectacles were worn. Rate of myopia progression was determined by AE and M change and subjects categorised as slow, moderate, or rapid progressors based on these changes. Outcomes of myopia control, based on the AE reduction after ortho-k, were classified as 'ineffectual', 'clinically insignificant', or 'beneficial'., RESULTS: Of the 20 subjects, initially categorised as slow by AE and, of whom 95% were similarly categorised by M change, none benefitted from ortho-k. In contrast, of the 22 subjects with moderate AE, 77% and 23% displaying slow and moderate M change, respectively, the majority (73%) benefitted from ortho-k lens wear. The 24 subjects with rapid AE were poorly identified by M change, with only 21% correctly categorised. The vast majority of rapid progressors showed significant benefit after ortho-k., CONCLUSION: Progression of AE is a good indicator of subsequent success of ortho-k treatment. Delaying commencement of therapy is prudent for children with slow progression as results indicate that they would be unlikely to benefit from this intervention. As change in refractive error frequently underestimates rapid progression of AE, its value for identifying appropriate candidates for myopia control is poor.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the incidence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in high myopic patients who experienced recent visual loss and to describe the characteristics of CNV that develop as a complication of pathologic myopia and were detected by fluorescein angiography (FA). Material and methods: The fluorescein angiograms of 89 patients with high myopia, who registered a recent decrease of visual acuity were reviewed. The incidence of CNV was evaluated and its angiofluorographic appearance described. Results: 172 eyes of 89 patients (six eyes were excluded for different reasons: anophthalmia, dense cataract, history of retinal detachment surgery) were analyzed. Among 89 patients (63 females, 26 males), in 58 cases (~65%), the angiofluorography revealed the presence of a neovascular membrane, and 8 cases presented bilateral CNV. That made a total of 66 eyes. The majority of CNVs were classic (56%), 20% had an occult pattern and 24% were cicatricial. The location was predominantly subfoveal. Conclusions: Considering that the main cause for visual loss in myopic patients is the new-onset myopic CNV, fluorescein angiography should be performed in cases with recent visual loss. When CNV is suspected, FA can demonstrate the presence of myopic CNV, bringing information regarding the type, area, and activity of the CNV and helping exclude other disorders. Due to its location, predominantly sub- or juxtafoveal and to the extended retinal lesions associated with pathologic myopia, the visual prognosis of these patients is poor despite new active treatments.

N2  - Myopia, also known as short-sightedness or near-sightedness, is a very common condition that typically starts in childhood. Severe forms of myopia (pathologic myopia) are associated with a risk of other associated ophthalmic problems. This disorder affects all populations and is reaching epidemic proportions in East Asia, although there are differences in prevalence between countries. Myopia is caused by both environmental and genetic risk factors. A range of myopia management and control strategies are available that can treat this condition, but it is clear that understanding the factors involved in delaying myopia onset and slowing its progression will be key to reducing the rapid rise in its global prevalence. To achieve this goal, improved data collection using wearable technology, in combination with collection and assessment of data on demographic, genetic and environmental risk factors and with artificial intelligence are needed. Improved public health strategies focusing on early detection or prevention combined with additional effective therapeutic interventions to limit myopia progression are also needed.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence, ethnic differences and associated risk factors of myopic maculopathy in Han and Uygur adults in Xinjiang, China., DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study with multistage, stratified cluster sampling method was conducted in Xinjiang, China., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4023 Han and Uygur participants aged 40 years and older were eligible for the study., OUTCOME MEASURES: The association between myopic maculopathy and its risk factors was screened using the generalised estimating equation (GEE) model. We also investigated whether ethnic differences exist between Han and Uygur populations affected by myopic maculopathy. Myopic maculopathy was defined in accordance with International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy., RESULTS: A total of 3044 subjects (5946 eyes) were included in our study (1736 Han and 1308 Uygur individuals). The participants consisted of 1256 (41.3%) men and 1788 (58.7%) women. The average age was 52.2+/-9.4 years, and the mean spherical equivalent (SE) was -0.18+/-2.31 dioptre (D). Myopic maculopathy was detected in 198 eyes of 138 participants. The age-adjusted prevalence of myopic maculopathy reached 5.8% (95% CI 4.8 to 6.8). In the GEE model, myopic maculopathy was significantly associated with old age (per year; OR: 1.16; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.19; p<0.001) and myopic SE (per -1 D; OR: 1.48; 95% CI 1.40 to 1.56; p<0.001). No ethnic differences were detected between Han (98, 5.7%) and Uygur population (40, 3.1%) in terms of the prevalence of myopic maculopathy (OR=0.89; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.48; p=0.64). Neither urbanisation (p=0.38) nor the level of education (p=0.92) was associated with myopic maculopathy., CONCLUSIONS: A high age-adjusted prevalence of myopic maculopathy was observed in Han and Uygur populations in Xinjiang, China. Old age and high degree of myopic refraction were independent risk factors for myopic maculopathy. No ethnic differences were detected in Han and Uygur populations affected by myopic maculopathy.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To provide the surgical indication for patients with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) by investigating the postoperative outcomes after vitrectomy among different types of morphological characteristic groups., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that included patients (37 eyes) diagnosed with MTM at a single institution. All 37 eyes from 37 patients with MTMs were classified into three groups: foveal retinoschisis (FS), lamellar macular hole (LMH), and foveal retinal detachment (FRD). The ratios of anatomic recovery, central retinal thickness (CRT), and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were statistically analyzed among the three groups preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after vitrectomy., RESULTS: Anatomical recovery could be found in all patients of the FS group at 6 months postoperatively and in the LMH group at 12 months postoperatively. Only 83.33% patients in the FRD group showed anatomic recovery until 12 months. The time taken for CRT to reduce to 200 microm was gradually increased between the FS, LMH, and FRD groups. Postoperative BCVA was better in the FS group than the LMH and FRD groups (P < .05), but the LMH and FDR groups had no difference (P >= .05) at any point. The visual acuity was significantly improved in the FS group (P < .01) and FRD group (P = .018), but not in the LMH group (P = .196) at 12 months postoperatively., CONCLUSIONS: The FS group achieved anatomical recovery in the shortest time and had the best postoperative BCVA. FRD patients could get visual gain but need too much time for the anatomical recovery. LMH patients experienced anatomic success with surgery, but not in BCVA. Early surgery might be considered for eyes at FS prior to the occurrence of LMH or FRD. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2020;51:574-582.]. Copyright 2020, SLACK Incorporated.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Currently, whether and when intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medication should be used in glaucoma suspects with high myopia (GSHM) remains unknown. Glaucoma suspects are visual field (VF) defects that cannot be explained by myopic macular changes or other retinal and neurologic conditions. Glaucoma progression is defined by VF deterioration. Here we describe the rationale, design, and methodology of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to evaluate the effects of medically lowering IOP in GSHM (GSHM study)., METHODS: The GSHM study is an open-label, single-center, RCT for GSHM. Overall, 264 newly diagnosed participants, aged 35 to 65 years, will be recruited at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, between 2020 and 2021. Participants will be randomly divided into two arms at a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention arm will receive IOP-lowering medication, while participants in the control arm will be followed up without treatment for 36 months or until they reach the end point. Only one eye per participant will be eligible for the study. If both eyes are eligible, the eye with the worse VF will be recruited. The primary outcome is the incidence of glaucoma suspect progression by VF testing over 36 months. The secondary outcomes include the incidence of changes in the optic nerve head morphology including the retinal nerve fiber layer, and retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer loss, progression of myopic maculopathy, visual function loss, and change in the quality of life. Statistical analyses will include baseline characteristics comparison between the intervention and control groups using a two-sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum test; generalized linear models with Poisson regression for the primary outcome; Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test for the incidence of the secondary outcome; and longitudinal analyses to assess trends in outcomes across time., DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, the GSHM study is the first RCT to investigate the impact of medically lowering IOP in GSHM. The results will have implications for the clinical management of GSHM., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04296916 . Registered on 4 March 2020.

N2  - This report describes development of spherical equivalent refraction (SER) and axial length (AL) in two population-based cohorts of white, European children. Predictive factors for myopic growth were explored. Participants were aged 6-7- (n = 390) and 12-13-years (n = 657) at baseline. SER and AL were assessed at baseline and 3, 6 and 9 years prospectively. Between 6 and 16 years: latent growth mixture modelling identified four SER classes (Persistent Emmetropes-PEMM, Persistent Moderate Hyperopes-PMHYP, Persistent High Hyperopes-PHHYP and Emerging Myopes-EMYO) as optimal to characterise refractive progression and two classes to characterise AL. Between 12 and 22-years: five SER classes (PHHYP, PMHYP, PEMM, Low Progressing Myopes-LPMYO and High Progressing Myopes-HPMYO) and four AL classes were identified. EMYO had significantly longer baseline AL (>= 23.19 mm) (OR 2.5, CI 1.05-5.97) and at least one myopic parent (OR 6.28, CI 1.01-38.93). More myopic SER at 6-7 years (<= + 0.19D) signalled risk for earlier myopia onset by 10-years in comparison to baseline SER of those who became myopic by 13 or 16 years (p <= 0.02). SER and AL progressed more slowly in myopes aged 12-22-years (- 0.16D, 0.15 mm) compared to 6-16-years (- 0.41D, 0.30 mm). These growth trajectories and risk criteria allow prediction of abnormal myopigenic growth and constitute an important resource for developing and testing anti-myopia interventions.

N2  - PURPOSE: To validate the recently developed ATN grading system for myopic maculopathy to classify eyes with pathologic myopia., METHODS: Cross-sectional study. A series of consecutive eyes diagnosed with pathologic myopia and signs of myopic maculopathy (grade >=1 for atrophic, tractional, or neovascular components of the ATN), with a refractive error > -6.0 diopters (D), were included. All patients underwent complete ophthalmological examination including fundus photography and swept-source optical coherence tomography. Six observers graded each eye twice using the ATN system (>=15 days between assessments) based only on the aforementioned data., RESULTS: Sixty eyes from 47 patients (61.7% female) were graded. Mean patient age was 63.2 +/- 11.7 years. The mean spherical equivalent was -13.8 +/- 6.5 D. Mean axial length was 28.6 +/- 2.16 mm. Overall, the mean intraobserver agreement (%) for the same image was 92.0%, and the mean interobserver agreement for the second image was 77.5%. The weighted Fleiss k showed excellent correlation (k > 0.8) for the traction and neovascularization components and good correlation (0.75) for atrophy. Interobserver agreement for each of these three components was 95.2%, 98.4%, 95.0%, respectively., CONCLUSION: Application of the ATN resulted in high intraobserver and interobserver correlation, underscoring the reproducibility of the system.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nearsightedness (myopia) causes blurry vision when one is looking at distant objects. Interventions to slow the progression of myopia in children include multifocal spectacles, contact lenses, and pharmaceutical agents., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions, including spectacles, contact lenses, and pharmaceutical agents in slowing myopia progression in children., SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; the LILACS Database; and two trial registrations up to February 2018. A top up search was done in February 2019., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We excluded studies when most participants were older than 18 years at baseline. We also excluded studies when participants had less than -0.25 diopters (D) spherical equivalent myopia., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods., MAIN RESULTS: We included 41 studies (6772 participants). Twenty-one studies contributed data to at least one meta-analysis. Interventions included spectacles, contact lenses, pharmaceutical agents, and combination treatments. Most studies were conducted in Asia or in the United States. Except one, all studies included children 18 years or younger. Many studies were at high risk of performance and attrition bias. Spectacle lenses: undercorrection of myopia increased myopia progression slightly in two studies; children whose vision was undercorrected progressed on average -0.15 D (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.29 to 0.00; n = 142; low-certainty evidence) more than those wearing fully corrected single vision lenses (SVLs). In one study, axial length increased 0.05 mm (95% CI -0.01 to 0.11) more in the undercorrected group than in the fully corrected group (n = 94; low-certainty evidence). Multifocal lenses (bifocal spectacles or progressive addition lenses) yielded small effect in slowing myopia progression; children wearing multifocal lenses progressed on average 0.14 D (95% CI 0.08 to 0.21; n = 1463; moderate-certainty evidence) less than children wearing SVLs. In four studies, axial elongation was less for multifocal lens wearers than for SVL wearers (-0.06 mm, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.04; n = 896; moderate-certainty evidence). Three studies evaluating different peripheral plus spectacle lenses versus SVLs reported inconsistent results for refractive error and axial length outcomes (n = 597; low-certainty evidence). Contact lenses: there may be little or no difference between vision of children wearing bifocal soft contact lenses (SCLs) and children wearing single vision SCLs (mean difference (MD) 0.20D, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.47; n = 300; low-certainty evidence). Axial elongation was less for bifocal SCL wearers than for single vision SCL wearers (MD -0.11 mm, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.08; n = 300; low-certainty evidence). Two studies investigating rigid gas permeable contact lenses (RGPCLs) showed inconsistent results in myopia progression; these two studies also found no evidence of difference in axial elongation (MD 0.02mm, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.10; n = 415; very low-certainty evidence). Orthokeratology contact lenses were more effective than SVLs in slowing axial elongation (MD -0.28 mm, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.19; n = 106; moderate-certainty evidence). Two studies comparing spherical aberration SCLs with single vision SCLs reported no difference in myopia progression nor in axial length (n = 209; low-certainty evidence). Pharmaceutical agents: at one year, children receiving atropine eye drops (3 studies; n = 629), pirenzepine gel (2 studies; n = 326), or cyclopentolate eye drops (1 study; n = 64) showed significantly less myopic progression compared with children receiving placebo: MD 1.00 D (95% CI 0.93 to 1.07), 0.31 D (95% CI 0.17 to 0.44), and 0.34 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.60), respectively (moderate-certainty evidence). Axial elongation was less for children treated with atropine (MD -0.35 mm, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.31; n = 502) and pirenzepine (MD -0.13 mm, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.12; n = 326) than for those treated with placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) in two studies. Another study showed favorable results for three different doses of atropine eye drops compared with tropicamide eye drops (MD 0.78 D, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.07 for 0.1% atropine; MD 0.81 D, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.05 for 0.25% atropine; and MD 1.01 D, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28 for 0.5% atropine; n = 196; low-certainty evidence) but did not report axial length. Systemic 7-methylxanthine had little to no effect on myopic progression (MD 0.07 D, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.24) nor on axial elongation (MD -0.03 mm, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.03) compared with placebo in one study (n = 77; moderate-certainty evidence). One study did not find slowed myopia progression when comparing timolol eye drops with no drops (MD -0.05 D, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.11; n = 95; low-certainty evidence). Combinations of interventions: two studies found that children treated with atropine plus multifocal spectacles progressed 0.78 D (95% CI 0.54 to 1.02) less than children treated with placebo plus SVLs (n = 191; moderate-certainty evidence). One study reported -0.37 mm (95% CI -0.47 to -0.27) axial elongation for atropine and multifocal spectacles when compared with placebo plus SVLs (n = 127; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared with children treated with cyclopentolate plus SVLs, those treated with atropine plus multifocal spectacles progressed 0.36 D less (95% CI 0.11 to 0.61; n = 64; moderate-certainty evidence). Bifocal spectacles showed small or negligible effect compared with SVLs plus timolol drops in one study (MD 0.19 D, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.32; n = 97; moderate-certainty evidence). One study comparing tropicamide plus bifocal spectacles versus SVLs reported no statistically significant differences between groups without quantitative results. No serious adverse events were reported across all interventions. Participants receiving antimuscarinic topical medications were more likely to experience accommodation difficulties (Risk Ratio [RR] 9.05, 95% CI 4.09 to 20.01) and papillae and follicles (RR 3.22, 95% CI 2.11 to 4.90) than participants receiving placebo (n=387; moderate-certainty evidence)., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antimuscarinic topical medication is effective in slowing myopia progression in children. Multifocal lenses, either spectacles or contact lenses, may also confer a small benefit. Orthokeratology contact lenses, although not intended to modify refractive error, were more effective than SVLs in slowing axial elongation. We found only low or very low-certainty evidence to support RGPCLs and sperical aberration SCLs. Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term results of gas tamponade without vitrectomy in patients with myopic foveoschisis (FS) and foveal detachment (FD)., METHODS: Twenty eyes of 20 patients with myopic foveoschisis and foveal detachment were analysed retrospectively. All patients received an intravitreal injection of 0.2-0.3 mL C3F8 as an initial treatment. The patients were followed up for at least 18 months after the procedure. The refractive status, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and anatomical abnormalities in macular area before and after the treatment were assessed and recorded., RESULTS: After initial gas tamponade, FD resolved completely (defined as responders) in 14 eyes, resolved partially in 2 eyes (defined as partial responders), and worsened in 4 eyes (non-responders) at the 3-month follow-up visit. Vitrectomy was performed in four eyes that showed increased detachment (two cases) or developed macular hole (two cases). Repeated gas injection was performed in two recurrent cases after initial success at the 3-month follow-up, and the foveal detachment once again resolved. Overall, 70% of our cases demonstrated resolution of FD at the 3-month follow-up and the long-term responders to gas injection was 65%. The risk factors for treatment failure were: (1) The presence of optical coherence tomography (OCT)-evident premacular membranes (p = 0.03) and (2) the height of FS measured >588 microm (p = 0.009)., CONCLUSION: Our data supported that gas tamponade may be effective as an alternative treatment for selected cases of myopic FS with FD. The procedure may be especially beneficial in patients without OCT-evident premacular membranes and have low height of FS.

N2  - PURPOSE: Excimer laser-based refractive procedures can have less predictable results when used for correcting high myopia than when used for moderate myopia. Small incision lenticule extraction might overcome this weakness. However, small incision lenticule extraction is only Food and Drug Administration approved for use in myopic eyes up to -8 D with astigmatism of -3 D or less. We report outcomes of small incision lenticule extraction in highly and moderately myopic eyes and compare these to modern laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis., METHODS: Retrospective, observational consecutive case series. Inclusion criteria: attempted myopic spherical correction -8 or-3 to -7.75 D with astigmatism -3 D, and corrected distance visual acuity of 1.0 (decimal scale) or better., RESULTS: A total of 62 highly myopic and 407 moderately myopic eyes were included. At 3 months postoperatively, the highly myopic eyes had a mean spherical equivalent refraction of -0.28 +/- 0.41 D (range: -1.13 to +0.75 D). Mean uncorrected distance visual acuity was 1.0. Mean efficacy index was 0.84. Mean safety index was 1.03. Uncorrected distance visual acuity same or better than corrected distance visual acuity: 61%. Astigmatism was 0.5 D in 90% and 1 D in 100%. The results in the moderately myopic eyes were comparable., CONCLUSION: We found equally good visual and refractive outcomes after small incision lenticule extraction for the correction of high and of moderate myopia combined with an astigmatic correction of up to 3 D, respectively.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Due to high prevalence myopia has gained importance in epidemiological studies. Children with early onset are at particular risk of complications associated with myopia, as progression over time might result in high myopia and myopic macular degeneration. Both genetic and environmental factors play a role in the increasing prevalence of myopia. The aim of this study is to review the current literature on epidemiology and risk factors for myopia in school children (aged 6-19 years) around the world., MAIN BODY: PubMed and Medline were searched for the following keywords: prevalence, incidence, myopia, refractive error, risk factors, children and visual impairment. English language articles published between Jan 2013 and Mar 2019 were included in the study. Studies were critically reviewed for study methodology and robustness of data. Eighty studies were included in this literature review. Myopia prevalence remains higher in Asia (60%) compared with Europe (40%) using cycloplegic refraction examinations. Studies reporting on non-cycloplegic measurements show exceptionally high myopia prevalence rates in school children in East Asia (73%), and high rates in North America (42%). Low prevalence under 10% was described in African and South American children. In recent studies, risk factors for myopia in schoolchildren included low outdoor time and near work, dim light exposure, the use of LED lamps for homework, low sleeping hours, reading distance less than 25 cm and living in an urban environment., CONCLUSION: Low levels of outdoor activity and near work are well-established risk factors for myopia; this review provides evidence on additional environmental risk factors. New epidemiological studies should be carried out on implementation of public health strategies to tackle and avoid myopia. As the myopia prevalence rates in non-cycloplegic studies are overestimated, we recommend considering only cycloplegic measurements.

N2  - Importance: Myopic maculopathy is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment worldwide. Moreover, the burden of myopic maculopathy has been expected to increase owing to the rising prevalence of myopia globally. However, there is limited epidemiologic evidence regarding the incidence of and risk factors for myopic maculopathy. This study from Japan, with a relatively high prevalence of myopia, could provide valuable information related to these issues., Objective: To estimate the incidence of myopic maculopathy and its risk factors in Hisayama in southwestern Japan., Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based prospective cohort study in a Japanese community in Hisayama, Japan. The study included a total of 2164 residents 40 years or older who had no myopic maculopathy at the baseline eye examination in 2012 and underwent follow-up eye examinations in 2017., Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of myopic maculopathy. The grades of myopic maculopathy were categorized based on the criteria of the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group classification system., Results: The mean (SD) age of the study participants was 62.4 (10.9) years, and the proportion of men was 42.5% (920 participants). In the follow-up examination in 2017, 24 patients developed myopic maculopathy. The 5-year cumulative incidence of myopic maculopathy was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.6-1.5) overall, 1.4% (95% CI, 0.6-2.2) for men, and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.4-1.4) for women. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age (per 1 year; odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11) and longer axial length (per 1 mm; OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.19-3.95) were associated with incident myopic maculopathy., Conclusions and Relevance: Twenty-four study participants (1%) developed myopic maculopathy during the 5-year study period, which is much higher than the rate in a previous study on a Chinese population. We also confirmed that aging and longer axial length were independent and significant risk factors for myopic maculopathy. These findings should be reviewed among various populations in other parts of the world.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the preservation of round optic nerve head (ONH) shape in myopic eyes of surgically treated congenital glaucoma patients, with regard to factors associated with intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation-induced peripapillary scleral (PPS) deformation. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT) on the ONH and macula, we identified myopic eyes with round ONH and internally oblique border tissue and those with non-round ONH. We investigated differences in clinical factors between the two groups. We included 51 eyes of 34 patients. Age at first surgery (2.8 vs. 15.2 months, P < 0.001) was significantly different between the two groups. Axial length was also significantly longer (P = 0.004) in the non-round group, but multiple logistic regression analysis revealed age as the only significant factor (P < 0.05) in ONH roundness. Interestingly, the round ONH group also had non-curved fundus morphology and a thick choroid, while the non-round ONH group showed diverse degrees of disc tilt and posterior pole curvature, and a thin choroid. In conclusion, in eyes with congenital glaucoma, age at first surgery, particularly when older than 6 months, was associated with round ONH and emmetropia-like fundus despite high myopia. The findings may indicate two different changes in the posterior sclera and the neural canal in response to the increased IOP.

N2  - PURPOSE: To quantify the defocus characteristics in the near-work environment at home and investigate the relationship with subsequent myopia progression., METHODS: Fifty subjects (aged 7-12 years) were recruited and followed for 1 year. The home near-work environment (writing desk) was measured at a baseline home-visit using the Kinect-for-Windows to capture a 3-dimensional image. The depth values of the image were then converted into scene defocus with respect to the subject's viewpoint. The defocus characteristics were quantified as the dioptric volume (the total amount of net defocus, or DV) and standard deviation of the defocus values (SDD ). Information on home size, time spent outdoors, and in front of a desk were also obtained. Univariate correlation, and multivariate regression were used to assess the association between myopia progression, defocus characteristics, and other co-variates., RESULTS: The baseline spherical equivalent refraction (M) and refraction change over 1 year (M) were - 1.51 +/- 2.02 D and - 0.56 +/- 0.45 D respectively. DV was not significantly correlated with M (Spearman's rho = -0.25, p = 0.08), while SDD was negatively correlated to M (Spearman's rho = -0.42, p = 0.003). Although SDD was not a significant predictor in multivariate analysis, the regional DV at 15degree-20degree eccentricity was significant (p = 0.001). Home size (F2,50 = 7.01, p = 0.002) and time spent outdoors (Independent t = -2.13, p = 0.04) were also associated with M, but not time spent in front of desk (Independent t = 0.78, p = 0.44)., CONCLUSION: The defocus profile in the home environment within the para-central field of view is associated with childhood refractive error development.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with fovea-sparing internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling (FSIP) and standard ILM peeling for myopic traction maculopathy (MTM)., DESIGN: Retrospective case series., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 102 eyes of 96 consecutive patients who underwent primary PPV for MTM and were followed up for at least 12 months., METHODS: We compared the outcomes of eyes that underwent vitrectomy with FSIP from October 2012 to March 2017 with those of eyes that underwent vitrectomy with standard ILM peeling from June 2008 to September 2012., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 12 months and the final follow-up visit after surgery, time to MTM resolution, and postoperative complications such as macular hole (MH) formation., RESULTS: There were 26 and 76 eyes in the FSIP and standard ILM peeling groups, respectively. In both groups, the mean visual acuity (VA) at the 12-month follow-up was significantly improved relative to the mean preoperative VA (P < 0.001 for both groups). The preoperative and postoperative BCVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) showed no significant between-group differences (preoperative: 0.60+/-0.35 in the FSIP group and 0.61+/-0.39 in the standard ILM peeling group, P = 0.935; postoperative BCVA: 0.32 +/- 0.43 in the FSIP group and 0.37 +/- 0.38 in the standard ILM peeling group, P = 0.281). The mean time to the resolution of foveal retinal detachment and schisis was also comparable between groups (8.9 +/- 4.8 months in the FSIP group and 6.9 +/- 4.6 months in the standard ILM peeling group, P = 0.084). None of the eyes in the FSIP group and 6 eyes (8%) in the standard ILM peeling group developed postoperative MH. Consequently, the BCVA at 12 months deteriorated by 3 or more lines for 4 eyes (5%) in the standard ILM peeling group; this deterioration was not observed for any eye in the FSIP group. Risk factors for postoperative MH formation were worse preoperative visual acuity (P = 0.035) and thinner choroidal thickness (P = 0.025)., CONCLUSIONS: The visual and anatomic improvements after vitrectomy with FSIP may be comparable to those after vitrectomy with standard ILM peeling, with FSIP showing the ability to prevent postoperative MH formation and a consequent impairment in vision.

N2  - PURPOSE: To identify novel susceptibility loci for high myopia., DESIGN: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) followed by replication and meta-analysis., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14 096 samples from East and Southeast Asian populations (2549 patients with high myopia and 11 547 healthy controls)., METHODS: We performed a GWAS in 3269 Japanese individuals (1668 with high myopia and 1601 control participants), followed by replication analysis in a total of 10 827 additional samples (881 with high myopia and 9946 control participants) from Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. To confirm the biological role of the identified loci in the pathogenesis of high myopia, we performed functional annotation and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with high myopia and GO terms enriched among genes identified in the current study., RESULTS: We identified 9 loci with genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 x 10-8). Three loci were previously reported myopia-related loci (ZC3H11B on 1q41, GJD2 on 15q14, and RASGRF1 on 15q25.1), and the other 6 were novel (HIVEP3 on 1p34.2, NFASC/CNTN2 on 1q32.1, CNTN4/CNTN6 on 3p26.3, FRMD4B on 3p14.1, LINC02418 on 12q24.33, and AKAP13 on 15q25.3). The GO analysis revealed a significant role of the nervous system related to synaptic signaling, neuronal development, and Ras/Rho signaling in the pathogenesis of high myopia., CONCLUSIONS: The current study identified 6 novel loci associated with high myopia and demonstrated an important role of the nervous system in the disease pathogenesis. Our findings give new insight into the genetic factors underlying myopia, including high myopia, by connecting previous findings and allowing for a clarified interpretation of the cause and pathophysiologic features of myopia at the molecular level.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the optical quality of highly myopic eyes under light and dark conditions and correlate it with other relevant parameters. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study was performed on 180 eyes of 90 highly myopic patients (29 males and 61 females; mean age: 27.833 +/- 0.364 years [range: 18-45 years]). The modulation transfer function (MTF) cutoff frequency, Strehl ratio, objective scattering index (OSI), and predicted visual acuity (PVA; 100%, 20%, and 9%) under different lighting conditions were measured to evaluate the optical quality, which was correlated with probable relevant factors, including, axis length, spherical equivalent (SE), uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), best-corrected distance visual acuity (BDVA), astigmatism, and corneal curvature. The relationship between these visual parameters and optical quality was analyzed using a generalized linear model. Results: The OSIs were 1.241 +/- 0.068 and 1.515 +/- 0.076; the MTF cutoff frequencies were 37.725 +/- 0.559 and 30.238 +/- 0.550 cpd; the Strehl ratios were 0.219 +/- 0.004 and 0.175 +/- 0.003; and the PVAs at 100%, 20%, and 9% were 1.257 +/- 0.019 and 1.001 +/- 0.018, 0.949 +/- 0.017 and 0.719 +/- 0.015, and 0.579 +/- 0.011 and 0.439 +/- 0.010, under bright and dark conditions respectively. The optical quality parameters were correlated with age, SE, BDVA, corneal astigmatism, and curvature to different degrees under different lighting conditions. Conclusions: The optical quality declined in highly myopic eyes under both bright and dark lighting conditions. SE, BDVA, corneal astigmatism, and curvature were correlated with optical quality to different degrees under different lighting conditions.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and evolution of lamellar macular hole (LMH) in high myopia and the parameters associated with structural worsening, defined as the development of foveal detachment or full-thickness macular hole., METHODS: Patients with high myopia and LMH were retrospectively recruited. The clinical characteristics and various parameters of optical coherence tomography were identified at baseline and during follow-up visits. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the hazard ratios for foveal detachment and full-thickness macular hole., RESULTS: Among 112 eyes (98 patients), 64.3% were female; the mean axial length of all eyes was 29.6 +/- 1.9 mm. The 'LMH without retinoschisis' group accounted for 39.3% of the eyes. Forty-two percent developed structural worsening within a median follow-up of 67 months. Multivariable regression on all cases showed elevated tissue inside the LMH (P = 0.003) protected against structural worsening while V-shaped LMH (P = 0.006) predicted it. In the "LMH with retinoschisis group", ellipsoid zone disruption (P = 0.035), and V-shaped LMH (P = 0.014) predicted structural worsening, while elevated tissue inside the LMH (P = 0.028) protected against it. In the "LMH without retinoschisis group", no associated factor was identified., CONCLUSIONS: LMHs in high myopia are unstable, especially those with V-shaped LMH. Elevated tissue inside LMHs have a protective effect against further structural worsening.

N2  - PURPOSE: Our aim was to highlight the presence and the frequency of posterior staphyloma (PS) in non-highly myopic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients and to study the relationship between PS and choroidal thickness (CT)., METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study of 77 eyes (39 patients) with RP, axial length inferior to 26 mm and clinically preserved macular area. All patients underwent fundus photography, A- and B-scan ocular ultrasonography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). PS was defined by an outward bowing of the sclera on SS-OCT and B-scans. The relationship between the PS and SS-OCT layers thicknesses was determined., RESULTS: Over 77 RP eyes of 39 patients studied, a PS was identified in 17 eyes (22%) of nine patients. Fifteen eyes had a narrow macular staphyloma (NMS), and two eyes had a wide macular staphyloma (WMS). Mean age in this group was 34.2 years (range 19-53 years), mean axial length was 23.60 +/- 0.61 mm and mean CT was 185.7 +/- 71 um versus 259.7 um in eyes without PS. The staphyloma edges corresponded to area of outer retina loss on SS-OCT and were larger than the hyperautofluorescent ring on FAF. We found a significant association between PS and CT in our RP patients (p = 0.003). The mean CT was significantly thinner in PS eyes compared to eyes without staphyloma. There was no significant association between PS and with visual acuity, years of progression, retinal thickness nor FAF findings., CONCLUSIONS: PS was present in 22% of non-highly myopic eyes with RP. Narrow macular staphyloma was the most common type observed in our series. A marked thinning of the choroid was noted in PS eyes when compared to RP eyes without PS, as well as the outer retina degeneration.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the risk between degree of myopia and myopic macular degeneration (MMD), retinal detachment (RD), cataract, open angle glaucoma (OAG), and blindness., Methods: A systematic review and meta-analyses of studies published before June 2019 on myopia complications. Odds ratios (OR) per complication and spherical equivalent (SER) degree (low myopia SER < -0.5 to > -3.00 diopter [D]; moderate myopia SER <= -3.00 to > -6.00 D; high myopia SER <= -6.00 D) were calculated using fixed and random effects models., Results: Low, moderate, and high myopia were all associated with increased risks of MMD (OR, 13.57, 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.18-29.79; OR, 72.74, 95% CI, 33.18-159.48; OR, 845.08, 95% CI, 230.05-3104.34, respectively); RD (OR, 3.15, 95% CI, 1.92-5.17; OR, 8.74, 95% CI, 7.28-10.50; OR, 12.62, 95% CI, 6.65-23.94, respectively); posterior subcapsular cataract (OR, 1.56, 95% CI, 1.32-1.84; OR, 2.55, 95% CI, 1.98-3.28; OR, 4.55, 95% CI, 2.66-7.75, respectively); nuclear cataract (OR, 1.79, 95% CI, 1.08-2.97; OR, 2.39, 95% CI, 1.03-5.55; OR, 2.87, 95% CI, 1.43-5.73, respectively); and OAG (OR, 1.59, 95% CI, 1.33-1.91; OR, 2.92, 95% CI, 1.89-4.52 for low and moderate/high myopia, respectively). The risk of visual impairment was strongly related to longer axial length, higher myopia degree, and age older than 60 years (OR, 1.71, 95% CI, 1.07-2.74; OR, 5.54, 95% CI, 3.12-9.85; and OR, 87.63, 95% CI, 34.50-222.58 for low, moderate, and high myopia in participants aged >60 years, respectively)., Conclusions: Although high myopia carries the highest risk of complications and visual impairment, low and moderate myopia also have considerable risks. These estimates should alert policy makers and health care professionals to make myopia a priority for prevention and treatment.

N2  - Purpose: We compared the change in the state of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) between highly myopic eyes and non-highly myopic eyes using age- and sex-matched patients., Methods: Six hundred eyes of 600 patients with high myopia (axial length > 26.0 mm) or without high myopia were enrolled into each of six age categories with 50 eyes each: (1) 20 to 29 years, (2) 30 to 39 years, (3) 40 to 49 years, (4) 50 to 59 years, (5) 60 to 69 years, and (6) 70 to 79 years. The PVD status was evaluated using swept-source optical coherence tomography and classified into five stages: 0 (no PVD), 1 (paramacular PVD), 2 (perifoveal PVD), 3 (peripapillary PVD), and 4 (complete PVD)., Results: In the high myopia and non-high myopia groups, the mean PVD stage increased significantly with the age category (P < 0.0001). The PVD stage was significantly greater in the high myopia group than in the non-high myopia group in all age categories (P <= 0.0395). In the age groups of patients 50 to 59 years old and 60 to 69 years old, complete PVD was detected in 54.0% and 73.9% of eyes, respectively, in the high myopia group and in 14.0% and 44.0% of eyes, respectively,in the non-high myopia group. Abnormal PVD characteristics of pathologic myopia were detected in 1.7% of eyes in the high myopia group., Conclusions: We precisely revealed, using age- and sex-matched patients, that partial PVD, including paramacular, perifoveal, and peripapillary PVD, and complete PVD develop at a significantly younger age in highly myopic eyes compared with non-highly myopic eyes, suggesting that PVD-related retinal pathologies occur younger in highly myopic patients.

N2  - Purpose: To examine the 6-year incidence, progression, associated risk factors, and impact of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in a myopic population in Singapore., Methods: We examined myopic (spherical equivalent <=-0.5 diopters) adults (N = 2157 persons and 3661 eyes) who were phakic at baseline and participated in both baseline and 6-year follow-up visits of the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study. Eye examinations, including visual acuity, subjective refraction and axial length (AL) measurements, were performed. MMD was graded from fundus photographs following the META-PM classification. Vision-related quality of life was assessed with Rasch-transformed scores from reading, mobility, and emotional domains of the Impact of Vision Impairment questionnaire., Results: The 6-year eye-specific incidence of MMD among myopic eyes was 1.2% (95% CI, 0.9%-1.6%). Older age, worse spherical equivalent, and longer AL at baseline were associated with MMD incidence (all P < 0.001). The 6-year eye-specific progression of MMD in 288 eyes with baseline MMD was 17.0% (95% CI, 12.6%-21.4%). More severe MMD at baseline, worse spherical equivalent, and longer AL (all P < 0.05) were associated with MMD progression. Patients with Meta-PM categories 3 and 4 had worse best-corrected visual acuity and poorer vision-related quality of life outcomes than those without MMD (all P < 0.05)., Conclusions: Over a 6-year period, one in 80 myopic eyes developed MMD and one in six with existing MMD had MMD progression. Myopia severity and AL were strong predictors of MMD development and progression. Eyes with severe MMD were at higher risk of MMD progression than those with less severe MMD, and were associated with poorer visual acuity and vision-related quality of life.

N2  - This study examined and compared outcomes of deep learning (DL) in identifying swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) images without myopic macular lesions [i.e., no high myopia (nHM) vs. high myopia (HM)], and OCT images with myopic macular lesions [e.g., myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and retinoschisis (RS)]. A total of 910 SS-OCT images were included in the study as follows and analyzed by k-fold cross-validation (k = 5) using DL's renowned model, Visual Geometry Group-16: nHM, 146 images; HM, 531 images; mCNV, 122 images; and RS, 111 images (n = 910). The binary classification of OCT images with or without myopic macular lesions; the binary classification of HM images and images with myopic macular lesions (i.e., mCNV and RS images); and the ternary classification of HM, mCNV, and RS images were examined. Additionally, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for the binary classifications as well as the correct answer rate for ternary classification were examined. The classification results of OCT images with or without myopic macular lesions were as follows: AUC, 0.970; sensitivity, 90.6%; specificity, 94.2%. The classification results of HM images and images with myopic macular lesions were as follows: AUC, 1.000; sensitivity, 100.0%; specificity, 100.0%. The correct answer rate in the ternary classification of HM images, mCNV images, and RS images were as follows: HM images, 96.5%; mCNV images, 77.9%; and RS, 67.6% with mean, 88.9%.Using noninvasive, easy-to-obtain swept-source OCT images, the DL model was able to classify OCT images without myopic macular lesions and OCT images with myopic macular lesions such as mCNV and RS with high accuracy. The study results suggest the possibility of conducting highly accurate screening of ocular diseases using artificial intelligence, which may improve the prevention of blindness and reduce workloads for ophthalmologists.

N2  - PURPOSE: To analyze the repeatability of manual measurement of foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area in an optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) image in high myopia., METHODS: This study comprised patients with high myopia and controls. Two consecutive FAZ areas of the superficial and deep capillary plexus were obtained using OCTA. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) were assessed, and univariate and multivariate generalized linear mixed models were conducted to identify factors related to repeatability., RESULTS: Thirty eyes with high myopia and 34 eyes of healthy subjects were included in the study. The mean age in high myopia and control subjects was 55.5 and 60.8 years, respectively, the mean spherical equivalent was -9.98 and -0.55 diopters, and the mean axial length was 28.0 and 23.9 mm. The ICCs of FAZ area of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) were 0.891 and 0.919, while the CVs were 8.8% and 8.5%. In measurement of the deep capillary plexus, the ICCs were 0.788 and 0.907, while the CVs were 11.2% and 11.0%, which were acceptable but exhibited lower repeatability than those of SCP. Multivariate analyses showed that older age (p = 0.030) and greater axial length (p = 0.005) were significantly associated with lower repeatability of SCP FAZ area measurements. In addition, greater axial length (p = 0.044) was a significant factor for lower repeatability of deep capillary plexus FAZ area measurements., CONCLUSIONS: Manual measurement of FAZ area using OCTA exhibited relatively good repeatability for high myopia. Age and axial length affected repeatability and should be considered when analyzing FAZ areas in high myopia patients. Copyright © 2020 The Korean Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - PURPOSE: A trend that myopia is becoming gradually more common is shown in studies worldwide. Highest frequencies have been found in East Asian urban populations (96.5%) but also a study in Europe shows that nearly half of the 25-29 year olds has myopia. With the increase in prevalence, high myopia, i.e. a spherical equivalent of -6 or more and an axial length of 26 mm or more is also on the rise. High myopia particularly carries a significant risk of ocular pathology related to the long axial length. This highlights the need for myopia management in children with progressive myopia, in particular progression to high myopia., RECENT FINDINGS: During the last decade, many intervention studies for myopia progression have emerged. Although lifestyle adjustments are effective, pharmacological and optical interventions have shown the highest efficacy on reduction of eye growth. High concentration atropine (0.5%-1.0%) shows the most reduction in axial length progression, but has drawbacks of light sensitivity and loss of accommodation. Nevertheless, when these side effects are mitigated by multifocal photochromatic glasses, the long-term adherence to high dose atropine is high. Lower concentrations of atropine are less effective, but have less side effects. Studies on optical interventions have reported reduction of progression for Ortho-K and multifocal contact lenses, but are in need for replication in larger studies with longer duration., SUMMARY: The field of myopia management is rapidly evolving, and a position on the best approach for daily clinics is desirable. Over the last 10 years, our team of clinical researchers has developed a strategy which involves decision-making based on age, axial length, position on the axial length growth chart, progression rate, risk of high myopia, risk profile based on lifestyle and familial risk, side effects, and individual preference. This personalised approach ensures the most optimal long-term myopia control, and helps fight against visual impairment and blindness in the next generations of elderly.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in the global population., METHODS: All published literature of population-based studies on MMD prevalence worldwide were searched and only those with clear definitions to diagnose and classify MMD lesions by standardised grading methods were selected. Meta-analysis methods were used to calculate the pooled prevalence of MMD and its 95% CI in a random-effects model. The prevalence of MMD lesions would also be reported, together with the subgroup analysis of age, region and gender. Correlation between MMD prevalence and spherical equivalent levels and axial length were also evaluated., RESULTS: 12 studies with 58 558 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of MMD in the world population was 2.1% (95% CI: 1.3% to 3.3%). In the subgroup analysis, people with the following characteristics were at higher risk of developing MMD: female, urban life, living in Asia, older age, longer axial length and severer myopia., CONCLUSIONS: MMD is a serious public health concern worldwide, particularly in subjects who are women, subjects living in urban areas, subjects living in Asia, and subjects with longer axial lengths and severer myopia. Further studies from other continents/ethnicities are needed for comprehensive estimates of the prevalence of MMD globally. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of Holladay 1 and SRK/T formulas with the axial length (AL) adjustment methods including the linear and nonlinear versions of Wang-Koch AL adjustment methods and Cooke-modified AL (CMAL); and to determine whether the CMAL should be extended to the latest Barrett Universal II, Ladas Super formula (LSF), and Emmetropia Verifying Optical formulas in highly myopic eyes., DESIGN: Retrospective, consecutive case-series study., METHODS: A total of 164 eyes of 164 patients with AL >=26.0 mm were included and divided into 2 groups: AL <28.0 mm (Group 1) and AL >=28.0 mm (Group 2). The average arithmetic spherical equivalent prediction error (PE), mean absolute PE, median absolute error (MedAE), and the percentage of eyes within +/-0.25 diopter (D), +/-0.50 D, and +/-1.0 D of PE were determined., RESULTS: The Holladay 1 formulas showed the smallest MedAE when combined with the first linear or nonlinear version of Wang-Koch AL adjustment methods, both in total and in subgroups. The SRK/T formula displayed the highest prediction accuracy in combination with the first linear version of Wang-Koch adjustment method in total and subgroups. The CMAL reduced the absolute PE of LSF in total (P = .003) and in Group 1 (P = .017)., CONCLUSIONS: The Holladay 1 and SRK/T formulas combined with specific AL adjustment methods had accuracy similar to the fourth-generation formulas for highly myopic eyes. Moreover, the CMAL can improve the accuracy of the LSF for highly myopic eyes. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the safety, efficacy, and patient-reported quality of vision of small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and implantable Collamer lens (ICL) implantation for the treatment of high myopia., METHODS: A database of 1,634 SMILE (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) and 225 ICL implantation (STAAR Surgical, Monrovia, CA) procedures was screened for patients with a binocular preoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent between -6.00 and -10.00 diopters (D) and plano target refraction. One-to-one matching was performed by preoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent, age, and pupil size. All identified patients were then prospectively examined at their next regular postoperative follow-up visit and presented with the standardized and clinically validated Quality of Vision questionnaire to gauge patient-reported postoperative visual quality., RESULTS: A total of 80 eyes (40 patients) were eligible for 1:1 matching. Mean postoperative follow-up was 27.8 +/- 14.3 months in the SMILE group and 26.6 +/- 17.7 months in the ICL group (P = .44). Regarding the percentage of eyes within +/-0.50 D of plano target, refractive predictability was better in eyes treated with ICL implantation (90%) than SMILE (72.5%) (P = .045). Mean UDVA was comparable (ICL: -0.09 +/- 0.10 logMAR; SMILE: -0.06 +/- 0.09 logMAR; P < .09), but the efficacy (1.28 vs 1.05; P < .001) and safety (1.31 +/- 0.22 vs 1.10 +/- 0.25; P < .001) indices were higher after ICL implantation. ICL implantation induced significantly fewer higher order aberrations (total higher order aberrations: SMILE 0.724 +/- 0.174 microm vs ICL 0.436 +/- 0.114 microm; P < .01). Regarding subjective quality of vision, patients who had ICL implantation were significantly less bothered by visual disturbances, which were mainly halos after ICL and starbursts and fluctuations of vision after SMILE (P < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: In this refraction-matched comparative study, ICL implantation for high myopia yielded better refractive accuracy, better uncorrected distance visual acuity, fewer higher order aberrations, and better subjective quality of vision than SMILE.

N2  - Gyrate atrophy is a rare metabolic autosomal recessive disorder caused by ornithine aminotransferase enzyme deficiency that leads to characteristic progressive, degenerative chorioretinal findings. Patients complain mostly of low vision, night blindness, and peripheral vision loss. Posterior subcapsular cataract, myopia, choroid neovascularization, and intraretinal cysts may be accompanying factors related to vision loss. We encountered a patient with vision loss secondary to posterior subcapsular cataract and intraretinal cysts. After treatment with topical brinzolamide and nepafenac (and without any diet mo dification and/or supplementation), we observed 143- and 117-mm macular thickness resolutions with 2 and 1 Snellen lines of visual gain in his right and left eyes, respectively. Also, we detected a novel homozygous mutation in the ornithine aminotransferase gene: c.1253T>C (p.Leu418Pro). Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and/or non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs can control macular edema in patients with gyrate atrophy-associated intraretinal cysts. The genetic variants may also be a determinant in the responsiveness to the therapy type.

N2  - PURPOSE: Analyze clinical features, management and outcomes of patients with sterile endophthalmitis associated with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor., METHODS: Observational retrospective case series of patients with sterile endophthalmitis following anti-VEGF intravitreal injections. Clinical data of patients treated with intravitreal anti-VEGFs during one year have been revised. Those who have presented an episode of sterile endophthalmitis are analyzed and their causality and management are studied., RESULTS: Seven patients have had a sterile endophthalmitis onset within 4days after intravitreal injection (aflibercept n=5 and ranibizumab n=2). These patients have some active neovascular condition: age related macular degeneration (n=4), myopic choroidal neovascularization (n=1) or macular edema: diabetic macular edema (n=1), branch retinal vein occlusion (n=1). Shared signs and symptoms included painless vision loss, anterior chamber and vitreous cell and lack of hypopyon. In all patients, visual acuity returned to within one line of baseline acuity., CONCLUSION: Differentiating cases of sterile from infectious endophthalmitis may be challenging. It is crucial to differentiate both entities as a good diagnosis determines the visual prognosis. We should be aware of minimal inflammation after repeated intravitreal injections in order to establish the adequate treatment. Copyright © 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Oftalmologia.

N2  - Importance: Although myopic maculopathy has become a major cause of vision impairment worldwide, few data from Russia and Central Asia on the prevalence of myopic maculopathy have been available., Objective: To assess the prevalence of myopic maculopathy and its associations with ocular and systemic parameters in a population in Russia., Design, Setting, and Participants: The Ural Eye and Medical Study, a population-based case-control study, was conducted in rural and urban areas in Bashkortostan, Russia, from October 26, 2015, to July 4, 2017. Data analysis was performed from September 13 to September 15, 2019. The Ural Eye and Medical Study included 5899 of 7328 eligible individuals (80.5%) aged 40 years or older., Exposures: A detailed ocular and systemic examination included fundus photography and optic coherence tomography for the assessment of myopic maculopathy., Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of myopic maculopathy., Results: The present investigation included 5794 of the 5899 eligible individuals (98.2%; 3277 [56.6%] women; mean [SD] age, 58.9 [10.7] years) with available information about myopic maculopathy. Mean (SD) axial length was 23.3 (1.1) mm (range, 19.78-32.87 mm). Prevalence of any myopic maculopathy was 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.6%); myopic maculopathy stage 2, 0.8% (95% CI, 0.6%-10.0%); stage 3, 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%); and stage 4, 0.2% (95% CI, 0.1%-0.4%). The prevalence of moderate to severe vision impairment and blindness was 29.8% (14 of 47 participants; 95% CI, 16.2%-43.3%) in stage 2 myopic maculopathy, 57.1% (8 of 14 participants; 95% CI, 27.5%-86.8%) in stage 3, and 100% (13 of 13 participants; 95% CI, 100%-100%) in stage 4. In multivariable analysis, a higher myopic maculopathy prevalence was associated with longer axial length (odds ratio [OR], 4.54; 95% CI, 3.48-5.92; P < .001), older age (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = .03), and thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001). After exclusion of glaucomatous eyes, the association between myopic maculopathy prevalence and thinner retinal nerve fiber layer remained significant (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001). Myopic maculopathy prevalence was not significantly associated with sex; region of habitation; level of education; ethnicity; prevalence of arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and inflammatory liver disease; hearing loss; depression score; or anxiety score., Conclusions and Relevance: In this ethnically mixed population from Russia, myopic maculopathy prevalence was mainly associated with elongated axial length and thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, but was not associated with any major internal medical disease, level of education, ethnicity, or sex. Higher myopic maculopathy stage was associated with vision impairment and blindness. In addition to a known association between high axial myopia and glaucoma, myopic maculopathy may be associated with nonglaucomatous optic neuropathy.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the long-term refractive effects of small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) on the correction of high myopia and astigmatism., SETTING: The Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China., DESIGN: Retrospective case series., METHODS: Patients had SMILE or FS-LASIK for high myopia. Subgroup analyses of high myopia (-6.00 to -8.75 diopters [D]) and extremely high myopia (>=-9.00 D) were performed. The main outcome measure was refractive predictability, compared between SMILE and FS-LASIK groups. Secondary outcomes included efficacy, safety, and residual astigmatism., RESULTS: This study included 121 patients (121 eyes: 75 in the SMILE group and 46 in the FS-LASIK group). No differences were found in terms of refractive predictability between SMILE and FS-LASIK in eyes with high myopia: 56% vs 58.7% achieved +/- 0.50 D of attempted correction (P = .771) and 81.3% vs 76.1% achieved +/- 1.00 D of attempted correction (P = .489). Efficacy indices of the SMILE and FS-LASIK groups were 1.02 +/- 0.24 and 1.03 +/- 0.24 (P = .742), respectively; safety indices were 1.23 +/- 0.22 and 1.20 +/- 0.24 (P = .324), respectively. Logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution uncorrected distance visual acuity and spherical equivalent in the high myopia subgroup were better than in the extremely high myopia subgroup after both SMILE and FS-LASIK (P < .01)., CONCLUSIONS: SMILE and FS-LASIK were both effective in correcting high myopia and myopic astigmatism. However, both techniques may require further nomogram adjustments when treating eyes with extremely high myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the morphologic features of the Schlemm canal and trabecular meshwork in highly myopic eyes with early intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation after cataract surgery., DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study., METHODS: Eighty-eight highly myopic eyes of 88 patients after uneventful cataract surgery were included, 31 of which had early postoperative IOP elevation and 57 of which did not. The morphologic features of the Schlemm canal and trabecular meshwork, collected with swept-source optical coherence tomography before surgery, were reviewed. Backwards stepwise multiple linear regression was used to investigate the anatomic risk factors for early IOP elevation in highly myopic eyes., RESULTS: Highly myopic eyes with early postoperative IOP elevation had smaller Schlemm canal vertical diameter and area, as well as smaller trabecular meshwork thickness and width, in each quadrant than the non-elevation group. There was no significant difference in Schlemm canal horizontal diameter between the IOP elevation and non-elevation groups. In the highly myopic eyes, average Schlemm canal vertical diameter, Schlemm canal area, trabecular meshwork thickness, and width were all correlated negatively with the IOP elevation. A multivariate analysis showed that average Schlemm canal vertical diameter (beta = -0.262, P = .004) and trabecular meshwork thickness (beta = -0.173, P < .001) were significantly associated with early transient IOP elevation in highly myopic cataract eyes., CONCLUSIONS: A smaller vertical diameter of Schlemm canal and a thinner trabecular meshwork are 2 anatomic risk factors for early IOP elevation after cataract surgery in highly myopic eyes.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) in terms of safety, refractive outcomes, visual quality, and biomechanical responses in correcting myopia with maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10 diopters (D)., SETTING: Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University., DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, comparative study., METHODS: The study comprised 60 eyes (60 patients) with a maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10 D; 30 eyes were corrected using SMILE and 30 eyes were corrected using FS-LASIK. Patients received preoperative and 6-month postoperative examinations, including refractive outcomes, corneal curve, contrast sensitivity, ocular aberrometry, and corneal biomechanical responses., RESULTS: At 6 months postoperatively, the uncorrected distance visual acuity was -0.01 +/- 0.06 and -0.05 +/- 0.10 in the SMILE and LASIK eyes, respectively (P = .08). The corrected distance visual acuity was -0.07 +/- 0.07 and -0.08 +/- 0.08 (P = .624), respectively. The postoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -0.20 +/- 0.25 D and -0.03 +/- 0.20 D, respectively (P = .008). The posterior corneal curvature was unchanged after SMILE and FS-LASIK (P > .05). The measured corneal thickness was reduced by 137.40 +/- 15.01 mum and 155.06 +/- 17.43 mum (P < .001). The change in the SE was -0.01 +/- 0.26 and -0.13 +/- 0.30 from 1 week (P = .103). Only the peak distance (the distance between the highest points of the nondeformed corneal parts) differed between the groups (1.06 +/- 1.44 mm vs -0.26 +/- 1.16 mm, P = .007). In the SMILE patients, changes in higher-order aberration (P = .018) and spherical aberration (P = .011) were smaller than in LASIK patients., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with LASIK, SMILE might offer superior safety and objective visual quality, comparable stability and efficacy, and a little inferior predictability in correcting maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10 D.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate prognostic factors related to the surgical outcome of vitrectomy in myopic traction maculopathy (MTM)., METHODS: Medical records of patients with MTM who underwent pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling and follow-up over 12 months were reviewed retrospectively. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fundoscopic examination and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography findings were evaluated postoperatively. Functional success was defined as visual acuity gain and anatomical success was defined as reduction or resolution of foveoschisis without complications., RESULTS: This study included 40 eyes of 36 patients. BCVA improved from 0.70 +/- 0.44 to 0.63 +/- 0.57 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution and central macular thickness decreased from 526.6 +/- 132.1 to 277.8 +/- 92.1 mum at final follow-up. Functional success was achieved in 24 (60.0%) eyes, and 33 (82.5%) eyes reached anatomical success. Presence of foveal detachment (FD) and higher category of myopic maculopathy were associated with both functional (p = 0.014, 0.021, respectively) and anatomical (p = 0.011, 0.022, respectively) failure. Longer preoperative axial length showed an association with functional failure but not with anatomical failure (p = 0.041). In multivariate analysis, FD was the only prognostic factor for both functional and anatomical outcome (p = 0.041, 0.043, respectively). Preoperative BCVA (r2 = 0.259, p = 0.001), axial length (r2 = 0.172, p = 0.008), and myopic maculopathy category (r2 = 0.336, p < 0.001) showed significant correlation with final BCVA., CONCLUSIONS: More severe myopic maculopathy and the presence of FD are associated with poorer functional and anatomical outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy in MTM. Better preoperative BCVA, shorter axial length, and less severe myopic maculopathy are correlated with better final BCVA. Copyright © 2020 The Korean Ophthalmological Society.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors associated with myopia and high myopia in children in South Korea., METHODS: A total of 983 children 5-18 years of age who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2016-2017 (KNHANES VII), a nationwide population-based cross-sectional study, were evaluated. Myopia and high myopia were defined as a spherical equivalent (SE) <= - 0.5 diopters (D) and SE <= --6.0 D. The association between refractive errors and potential risk factors for myopia was analyzed., RESULTS: The prevalence of myopia and high myopia was 65.4 and 6.9%, respectively. Older age and parental myopia were significantly associated with both myopia and high myopia, while higher body mass index (BMI) was associated with high myopia only. Although the proportion of subjects who spent more time on near work activities (>=4 h/day) was sequentially increased with increased refractive error, this tendency was not statistically significant by multivariable logistic regression., CONCLUSIONS: Korean children had a high prevalence of myopia and high myopia. In this age group, the risk of myopia increased with aging and parental myopia. Higher BMI may be associated with high myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: Orthokeratology (OK) lens is a popular optical method to control myopia progression. This study aimed to assess the effect of OK lens on axial length change compared with glasses., METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched to retrieve the related articles. Then, the articles were selected according to predefined criteria. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were selected as effect size for combining and analyzing the change in axial length., RESULTS: A total of 13 articles were included in the present study. Different models were selected according to the heterogeneity of each analysis. The axial length change in OKs group was significantly smaller than control group; SMD (95% CI) of change in axial length was - 0.857 (- 1.146, - 0.568), p < 0.001 at the end of 1 year and - 0.701 (- 1.675, 0.272), p < 0.001 at the end of 2 years or longer time., CONCLUSIONS: OK lens treatment appears more effective in slowing axial elongation than glasses during the early treatment of myopia in children.

N2  - AIMS: To determine the prevalence of myopic maculopathy in the general population in Germany and to analyse potential associations with ocular and systemic factors., DESIGN: The Gutenberg Health Study is a population-based study, including 15 010 participants aged 35-74 years., METHODS: Myopic maculopathy was graded in phakic eyes with spherical equivalent <=-6 D by assessing fundus photographs according to a recent international photographic classification system (META-PM). 801 eyes of 519 participants (mean age 51.0+/-0.77 years) met the conditions and had gradable fundus photographs. Age-specific prevalence estimates were computed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess associated factors with myopic maculopathy., RESULTS: Myopic maculopathy was present in 10.3% (95% CI 7.9 to 13.3) study participants. The prevalence was 8.6% (95% CI 6.1% to 11.9%) in the 397 right eyes and 8.7% (95% CI 6.2% to 12.0%) in the 404 left eyes. The most common type of pathology was diffuse atrophy (8.1%), followed by patchy atrophy (1.3%) and macular atrophy (0.5%); plus lesions were present in 3% (right eyes). Age (OR 1.07 per year, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11, p<0.001), higher myopic refractive error (p<0.001), and male gender (p=0.02) were associated with myopic maculopathy, while cardiovascular risk factors and socioeconomic factors were not., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of myopic maculopathy in the German population was 0.5%, and 10% in high myopic participants, aged 35-74 years. These population-based data are the first in Europe. Myopic maculopathy was related to severity of myopic refractive error and age. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

N2  - AIM: To investigate vascular changes of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) after ranibizumab treatment using optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA)., METHODS: Consecutive subjects with a diagnosis of mCNV were included. Patients underwent intravitreal injection of ranibizumab treatment with a 6-month follow-up. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination and OCTA evaluation. The 3 x 3 OCTA en face images were analyzed for the absence/presence of mCNV, CNV area, and CNV network morphology. In particular, the morphology of the mCNV was analyzed in order to detect the presence/absence of feeder vessels., RESULTS: Eleven subjects were evaluated. At baseline, the mCNV was identified in all cases on OCTA. At 6 months, the mean mCNV area was not statically significantly reduced in comparison with baseline values (p > 0.05), while the morphologic analysis revealed a complete disappearance of the feeder vessel in 6 eyes. The subgroup analysis of these latter showed that the CNV area was significantly reduced, visual acuity had improved, and only one intravitreal injection was administrated over the entire follow-up period., CONCLUSIONS: OCTA allowed the detection of qualitative and quantitative vascular changes in mCNV. The disappearance of the feeder vessel was associated with better anatomical as well as functional outcomes at the last follow-up visit. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - PURPOSES: This research aimed to investigate effects and risk factors on non-contact tonometer (NCT) readings in healthy myopic subjects by employing cross-sectional study design., METHODS: Totally, sixty otherwise healthy myopic volunteers (mean 28.4 years old) with 90% female were recruited in ophthalmic clinic. The routine ophthalmic tests, refractive evaluation, examination central corneal thickness (CCT), depth of anterior chamber, axial length, corneal curvature, white-to-white and NCT were assessed at baseline. The linear-mixed model was utilized to evaluate correlation between the readings and ocular biometric parameters., RESULTS: For population in this study, mean spherical equivalents were - 4.85 +/- 1.79 diopters in right eyes and - 4.63 +/- 1.95 diopters in left eyes. Meanwhile, 28.3% of the eyes had a refractive error exceeding - 6.0 diopters. The mean NCT reading was 15.02 +/- 3.02 mmHg in left eyes and 15.33 +/- 2.96 mmHg in right eyes. Among the factors analyzed, CCT was the most significant parameter associated with NCT readings. After adjusting for the other factors, per one standard deviation increase of central corneal thickness (36.11 mum) was associated a 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.53-1.77) mmHg elevated NCT reading. The average central corneal curvature, age and spherical equivalence were also significantly and independently associated with NCT readings., CONCLUSIONS: Central corneal thickness, age, corneal curvature and degree of myopia were independently associated with NCT measured intraocular pressure. Central corneal thickness is one of the most influential factors.

N2  - The macular neovascular disease is a group disorder with complex pathogenesis of neovascularization for vision impairment and irreversible blindness, posing great challenges to precise diagnosis and management. We prospectively recruited participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and pathological myopia (PM) and compared with cataract patients without fundus diseases as a control group. The serum metabolome was profiled by gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) analysis. Multivariate statistical methods as well as data mining were performed for interpretation of macular neovascularization. A total of 446 participants with macular neovascularization and 138 cataract subjects as the control group were enrolled in this study. By employing GC-TOFMS, 131 metabolites were identified and 33 differentiating metabolites were highlighted in patients with macular neovascularization. For differential diagnosis, three panels of specific metabolomics-based biomarkers provided areas under the curve of 0.967, 0.938, and 0.877 in the discovery phase (n = 328) and predictive values of 87.3%, 79%, and 85.7% in the test phase (n = 256). Personalized pathway dysregulation scores measurement using Lilikoi package in R language revealed the pentose phosphate pathway and mitochondrial electron transport chain as the most important pathways in AMD; purine metabolism and glycolysis were identified as the major disturbed pathways in PCV, while the altered thiamine metabolism and purine metabolism may contribute to PM phenotypes. Serum metabolomics are powerful for characterizing metabolic disturbances of the macular neovascular disease. Differences in metabolic pathways may reflect an underlying macular neovascular disease and serve as therapeutic targets for macular neovascular treatment.

N2  - Myopia is an increasingly common condition that is associated with significant costs to individuals and society. Moreover, myopia is associated with increased risk of glaucoma, retinal detachment and myopic maculopathy, which in turn can lead to blindness. It is now well established that spending more time outdoors during childhood lowers the risk of developing myopia and may delay progression of myopia. There has been great interest in further exploring this relationship and exploiting it as a public health intervention aimed at preventing myopia in children. However, spending more time outdoors can have detrimental effects, such as increased risk of melanoma, cataract and pterygium. Understanding how spending more time outdoors prevents myopia could advance development of more targeted interventions for myopia. We reviewed the evidence for and against eight facets of spending time outdoors that may protect against myopia: brighter light, reduced peripheral defocus, higher vitamin D levels, differing chromatic spectrum of light, higher physical activity, entrained circadian rhythms, less near work and greater high spatial frequency (SF) energies. There is solid evidence that exposure to brighter light can reduce risk of myopia. Peripheral defocus is able to regulate eye growth but whether spending time outdoors substantially changes peripheral defocus patterns and how this could affect myopia risk is unclear. Spectrum of light, circadian rhythms and SF characteristics are plausible factors, but there is a lack of solid evidence from human studies. Vitamin D, physical activity and near work appear unlikely to mediate the relationship between time spent outdoors and myopia. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence of the early transient intraocular pressure (IOP) spike after cataract surgery in eyes with highly myopic cataract (HMC) and associated risk factors., METHODS: Consecutive patients treated with phacoemulsification were recruited. IOP was measured before and 1 day, 3 days, 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were recorded, and optic disc tilt, rotation and beta-zone peripapillary atrophy (beta-PPA) were measured from fundus photographs taken 1 week after surgery. Backward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to investigate the risk factors for early transient IOP spike in the HMC group., RESULTS: Finally, 94 eyes of 94 HMC patients and 67 eyes of 67 age-related cataract (ARC) controls were included in analysis. The incidence of early IOP spike was 10% in the ARC group and 28% in the HMC group (OR=3.277, p<0.05) at 1 day after surgery. In the HMC group with IOP spikes, more males were seen and affected eyes showed longer AL, shallower ACD, greater optic disc tilt, and larger beta-PPA than those without (all p<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that sex, AL, ACD, and area of beta-PPA were significantly associated with an early transient IOP spike in HMC eyes (all p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Highly myopic eyes are more susceptible to early transient IOP spike after cataract surgery, and male sex, longer AL, shallower ACD, and greater beta-PPA are associated risk factors., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02182921.

N2  - Importance: Lower bevacizumab dosages are being used for type 1 retinopathy of prematurity, but there are limited data on long-term ocular outcomes with lower doses., Objective: To evaluate ocular outcomes at 12 months' corrected age for eyes that received a dose of 0.625 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.125 mg, 0.063 mg, or 0.031 mg of bevacizumab for type 1 retinopathy of prematurity., Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used a masked, multicenter, phase 1 dose de-escalation study design and was conducted from April 2016 to October 2017. Study eyes were treated with a dose of 0.25, 0.125, 0.063, or 0.031 mg of bevacizumab; fellow eyes were treated with a dosage 1 level higher than the study eye. Additional treatment after 4 weeks was at investigator discretion. Data analysis occurred from November 2018 to March 2019., Interventions: Intravitreous bevacizumab injections of 0.625 mg to 0.031 mg., Main Outcomes and Measures: Visual fixation, amblyopia, alignment, nystagmus, cycloplegic refraction, and ocular examinations were assessed at 12 months' corrected age as preplanned secondary outcomes. The primary outcome 4 weeks after treatment and secondary outcomes after 6 months' corrected age have been previously reported., Results: Forty-six of 61 infants (75%) had a 12-month follow-up examination (46 study eyes and 43 fellow eyes; median [interquartile range] birth weight, 650 [590-760] g). Of 87 eyes with a cycloplegic refraction, 12 (14% [95% CI, 7%-27%]) had myopia of more than -5.00 D spherical equivalent; 2 (2%; [95% CI, 0%-8%]) had hyperopia greater than 5.00 D spherical equivalent; and 5 infants (11% [95% CI, 4%-24%]) had anisometropia greater than 1.50 D spherical equivalent. Abnormalities of the cornea, lens, or anterior segment were reported in 1 eye (1% [95% CI, 0%-6%]), 3 eyes (3% [95% CI, 1%-10%]), and 3 eyes (3% [95% CI, 1%-10%]), respectively. Optic nerve atrophy was identified in 11 eyes (13% [95% CI, 6%-26%]), and 1 eye (1% [95% CI, 0%-6%]) had total retinal detachment. Strabismus was reported in 13 infants (30% [95% CI, 17%-45%]), manifest nystagmus in 7 infants (15% [95% CI, 6%-29%]), and amblyopia in 3 infants (7% [95% CI, 1%-18%]). Overall, 98% of infants had central fixation in each eye (44 of 45 eyes)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of low-dose bevacizumab, the secondary outcomes of high myopia, strabismus, retinal detachment, nystagmus, and other ocular abnormalities at 1 year were consistent with rates reported in other studies with higher dosages., Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02390531.

T1  - Retinoschisis: splitting hairs on retinal splitting.

N2  - Retinoschisis can be found in the fovea or the retinal periphery, either of which may be present in isolation, or in conjunction with each other. Foveal schisis may be congenital, acquired, or secondary to an associated ocular pathology such as optic pit, glaucoma, or pathological myopia. The visual acuity is dependent on the cause of the schisis and appropriate treatment is variable based on likelihood for progression and visual impact. There are many useful considerations and tools for evaluation and monitoring that can be used to determine the aetiology and prognosis of these retinal findings. Retinoschisis is a diagnosis of exclusion, and pathology must be ruled out to accurately make the diagnosis. A review of two cases and following discussion summarises the various types, manifestations, presentations, and complications of retinoschisis and their evaluation, management, and appropriate monitoring or treatment. These cases lead a dialogue on the presentation and aetiology of retinoschisis, important considerations for differential diagnoses, and appropriate management. Copyright © 2019 Optometry Australia.

N2  - We evaluate the impact of duration on the treatment effect of multifocal spectacle lenses used to inhibit myopia progression in children. A systematic literature search identified randomized controlled trials where multifocal lenses were prescribed as the intervention, with single-vision lenses as the control. Nine randomized control trials involving 1,701 children aged 8-13 years were included in the meta-analysis. Treatment effects, that is, differences in spherical equivalent refraction between intervention and nonintervention groups, were analyzed over both 6- and 12-month intervals. As treatment duration increased, effectiveness reduced. In 6-month intervals, treatment effects were 0.07 D (95 % CI 0.02, 0.13), 0.03 D (95% CI -0.02, 0.08), and 0.02 D (95% CI -0.05, 0.11) for baseline to 6, 6-12, and 12-18 months, respectively. For 12-month intervals, treatment effects were 0.21 D (95% CI 0.12, 0.29), 0.11 D (95% CI 0.03, 0.19), and 0.12 D (95% CI -0.01, 0.25) for baseline to 12, 12-24, and 24-36 months, respectively. Even during the second 6 months of wear, the ability of multifocal spectacle lenses to inhibit myopia progression was reduced. It is not appropriate to extrapolate the treatment effect observed in the first 6 months or 12 months to estimate the likely future benefit of treatment. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - AIMS: To assess specific layers of the choroid in highly myopic young adults and to examine their associations with levels of myopia., METHODS: We recruited 51 young myopes (n=91 eyes) from the Singapore Cohort of Risk Factors for Myopia cohort. We performed standardised optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography imaging and developed a novel segmentation technique assessing choroidal layers' thickness (overall choroidal thickness (CT), medium-vessel choroidal layer (MVCL) thickness, large-vessel choroidal layer (LVCL)) and vasculature (choroidal vessel density (%), choroidal branch area (CBA, %) and mean choroidal vessel width (MCVW, mm))., RESULTS: We found that eyes with extreme myopia (EM) had thinner vascular layers compared with high myopia (HM), that is, LVCL (36.0+/-1.5 vs 39.2+/-1.2 microm, p=0.002) and MVCL (185.5+/-5.7 vs 198.2+/-4.6 microm, p=0.014). Overall CT was thinnest in the nasal and inferior quadrants in EM (nasal: 157.1+/-9.6 vs 187.2+/-8.3 microm, p<0.001; superior: 236.6+/-11.1 vs 257.0+/-9.5 microm, p=0.02; temporal: 228.0+/-10.6 vs 254.3+/-8.8 microm, p=0.012; and inferior quadrant: 198.7+/-10.0 vs 239.8+/-8.3 microm, p=<0.001) when compared with HM. We also observed significantly more vessel branching in eyes with EM as compared with eyes with HM (CBA, 10.2%+/-0.7% vs 9.95%+/-0.8%, p=0.018)., CONCLUSIONS: The novel segmentation technique and introduced choroidal parameters may serve as new biomarkers to study disease conditions in myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: A single variant (p.G38D) in the GNAT1 gene, encoding the rod-specific transducin alpha-subunit in phototransduction, has been reported only in one French family with Nougaret-type autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). We identified a Japanese family with Nougaret-type CSNB and cone-rod dystrophy (CORD)., METHODS: Five patients with CSNB and two patients with childhood-onset CORD were recruited. We performed a comprehensive ophthalmic examination including electroretinography (ERG). Disease-causing variants were identified by whole exome sequencing, with candidates confirmed by Sanger sequencing in nine family members., RESULTS: The GNAT1 variant (p.G38D) was identified in all four CSNB patients, whereas the two CORD patients carried biallelic truncated known ABCA4 variants as well as the GNAT1 variant. Clinically, no remarkable findings were observed in fuduscopy, fundus autofluorescence, or optical coherence tomography images from the CSNB patients. No response was detectable by rod ERG. The a-waves of standard and bright flash ERG were delayed and broadened rather than biphasic, and b/a-wave amplitude ratio was negative. Cone and 30-Hz flicker responses were normal, and overall, the ERG findings were compatible with previous descriptions of Nougaret-type CSNB. ERG of the CORD patients with macular atrophy showed non-recordable rod response and severely decreased standard flash, cone and 30-Hz flicker responses., CONCLUSIONS: This is the second report of a Nougaret-type CSNB family with the GNAT1 variant. Our novel findings suggest that coexistence of the GNAT1 and biallelic ABCA4 variants is associated with an overlapping phenotype with both Nougaret-type CSNB and CORD.

N2  - PURPOSE: To characterize profile of cytokines in aqueous humour of common macular diseases during intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy., METHODS: Aqueous humour from eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), diabetic macular oedema (DME), neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) or pathologic myopia associated choroidal neovascularization (pmCNV) was sampled prior to 1st (n = 144) and 2nd (n = 48) intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Cytokines including vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were quantitated and analysed along with retinal thickness data by optical coherence tomography (OCT) across two intravitreal injections and five macular disease types., RESULTS: ICAM-1, IL-6 and VEGF are positively associated in the aqueous humour of naive eyes (r = 0.39-0.77, p = 0.018 to <0.0001). ICAM-1, VEGF and IL-6 were significantly higher in CRVO and DME while lowest in pmCNV (p < 0.0001). Reduction of central retinal thickness (CRT) as a favourable response to anti-VEGF therapy was in the order of CRVO, BRVO, DME and nAMD/pmCNV (p < 0.0001). The strongest predictor for favourable CRT reduction was baseline CRT (p < 0.0001) followed by baseline ICAM-1 (p = 0.04). After the 1st intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, VEGF in aqueous humour lowered significantly but ICAM-1 and IL-6 levels remained unchanged. ICAM-1 was not predictive for CRT reduction following 2nd anti-VEGF therapy., CONCLUSION: Rate of cytokine production is disease-dependent and higher in CRVO and DME. Anatomical response to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is disease-specific and best in RVO patients. A combination therapy using both anti-VEGF and anti-inflammatory therapeutics may be superior to single anti-VEGF therapy, at least for RVO and DME.

N2  - AIM: To determine the longitudinal changes in the axial length (AL) in patients with high myopia without any other ophthalmic disease METHODS: Participants were divided into two groups: a high myopia group (60 eyes) without myopic degeneration, such as chorioretinal atrophy or posterior staphyloma, and a control group (60 eyes). Both groups were further divided into subgroups according to the AL: subgroup 1 (>=27.5 mm), subgroup 2 (26.0-27.5 mm), subgroup 3 (24.5-26.0 mm) and subgroup 4 (<24.5 mm). The ALs were measured five times at 1-year interval using an IOL master, and the AL was fitted with linear mixed models., RESULTS: In the high myopia group, the AL showed a relatively constant increase at each visit, and they were significantly different with previous measurements at most visits, whereas the control group showed no significant change of AL. Subgroups 1,2 and 3 showed significant changes in AL over time (0.064, 0.032 and 0.012 mm/y, respectively). In univariate analyses, age, best-corrected visual acuity, baseline AL and anterior chamber depth were significantly correlated with changes in the AL in the high myopia group. In multivariate analysis, only baseline AL remained significant (p<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Myopic eyes, including moderately myopic eyes, showed a consistent increase in AL over 4 years, and eyes with a longer baseline AL showed a greater increase in AL than eyes with a shorter AL.

N2  - PURPOSE: To analyze the efficacy and outcome predictors of SD-OCT (spectral-domain optical coherence tomography)-driven ranibizumab treatment in patients with choroidal neovascularization due to myopia (mCNV)., METHODS: This prospective investigator-initiated study includes 20 patients with treatment-naive mCNV. Evaluation included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), morphological SD-OCT parameters, and treatment frequency., RESULTS: From baseline to month 12, BCVA improved from 58.5 +/- 16.9 to 66.1 +/- 14.9 letters. Central retinal thickness (CRT) significantly decreased, and qualitative SD-OCT parameters improved. Better baseline visual acuity (VA), lower spherical equivalent, better inner/outer segment line and external limiting membrane integrity showed a significant positive effect on BCVA outcome. Less fluctuation in CRT (worst minus best CRT) indicated better BCVA at 12 months. No serious adverse events occurred., CONCLUSIONS: SD-OCT-guided intravitreal ranibizumab treatment in mCNV was efficient and safe. We determined useful predictive factors in regard to VA outcome after 12 months. Copyright The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to evaluate the progression and new onset of macular retinoschisis (MRS) in the patients treated with intravitreal Conbercept injections for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV)., METHODS: Post-hoc analysis of 160 mCNV patients included in SHINY study was performed to evaluate the impact of Conbercept injection on MRS in patients with mCNV undergoing intravitreal Conbercept injections. The patients were 3:1 randomized to the study group (three loading dose and thereafter pro re nata [PRN]) and the control group (3 months' sham injection, then one Conbercept injection at month 4 and thereafter PRN). MRS was assessed with optical coherence tomography by masked graders., RESULTS: At baseline, 28 of 122 eyes in study group and 10 of 38 eyes in control group had MRS. At month 3, two patients showed MRS progression and one patient had new onset MRS in study group. No MRS progression nor new onset MRS was found in the control group. At final visit, the cumulative incidence of MRS was 1.3% (2/160). Both Spearman's correlation and multiple logistic regression demonstrated no association between the progression and new onset of MRS and intravitreal injection frequency (correlation coefficient = 0.017, P = 0.851 and odds ratio = 0.996, P = 0.982). In addition, baseline vitreoretinal adhesion was the most likely potential risk factor resulting in MRS progression (odds ratio = 4.566, P = 0.027). Furthermore, MRS progression was more likely to take place in outer retinal layers., CONCLUSIONS: The progression and new onset of MRS was not associated with the frequency of intravitreal Conbercept injections.

The purpose of this study was to examine the expression of DKK1 in vitreous samples of patients with pathological myopia, in order to search for possible correlations between DKK1 and axial length. Materials and Methods: The expression of DKK1 and other cytokines in vitreous samples of 44 non-myopic eyes, 42 eyes with low-to-moderate myopia, and 51 eyes with pathological myopia were examined using multiplex cytokine detection technology. Ophthalmologic characteristics, including axial length and subfoveal choroidal thickness, were clinically measured for further analysis. Results: The intravitreous levels of DKK1 (P < .0001) were markedly higher in the pathological myopia group than in the control group. There were no differences of DKK1 levels in different vitreoretinal conditions. Additionally, we found that the DKK1 levels were positively correlated with HGF (beta = 0.268, P = .032), and TIMP-3 (beta = 0.209, P = .047) levels, as well as with axial length (beta = 0.714, P < .0001) in the pathological myopia group. Conclusions: Elevated levels of DKK1 were found in the eyes with elongated axial length.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the incidence and characteristics of intrachoroidal cavitation (ICC) in the eyes with high myopia., METHODS: In this retrospective, non-interventional, comparative study, we analysed the case records of 108 eyes with and without pathological myopia (PM). PM was defined as having a refractive error (spherical equivalent) of >= - 6.0 D or axial length >= 26 mm. The presence of other features like posterior vitreous detachment, myopic traction maculopathy, posterior staphyloma, focal/patchy chorioretinal atrophy (CRA), choroidal neovascularisation and retinoschisis was looked for on OCT. The association of these features with ICC was analysed using statistical tests., RESULTS: In this study, 38 out of 68 eyes with PM and 4 out of 40 eyes with non-PM showed the bowing of the posterior sclera and the presence of ICC. On statistical analysis with Chi-square test and multiple variable linear regression analysis tests, it was identified that the presence of focal/patchy CRA (p = 0.005) and intrascleral vessels (p = 0.018) in and around the cavitation was important features noted in eyes with ICC. The OCT features of macular and peripapillary ICC were similar. The transudation of fluid from the dilated intrascleral vessels in and around the ICC could be one other mechanism responsible for the development of ICC., CONCLUSION: ICC is seen in 55.8% of highly myopic eyes with the presence of focal CRA or myopic conus and/or presence of intrascleral vessels near the cavitation. These findings suggest that patchy atrophy affects the scleral contour within posterior staphyloma beyond the funduscopically identified patchy atrophy by ICC. The presence of intrascleral vessels could also contribute to the ICC development. Eyes with patchy CRA or myopic conus needs to be checked on further follow-up visits for the development of macular or peripapillary ICC.

N2  - PURPOSE: To reveal clinical features of patchy atrophy in pathologic myopia and investigate the status of the Bruch membrane and retinal pigment epithelium by swept-source optical coherence tomography., METHODS: This study reviewed highly myopic patients who visited the high myopia clinic between January 2015 and February 2018. Wide-field photographs and wide-field fundus autofluorescence fundus images were used as the primary method for identifying PAs, and swept-source optical coherence tomography images were used for investigating the retinochoroid status of PAs., RESULTS: Four hundred fifty-six PAs were detected in 137 eyes (118 patients). Patchy atrophys were located most often in the macular area (28.3%), followed by the inferior (25.9%), temporal (18.9%), nasal (14.5%), and superior (12.5%) region. All 210, PAs which had been fully or partially scanned by swept-source optical coherence tomography, showed a retinal pigment epithelium defect, and 174 (82.9%) PAs showed a Bruch membrane defect on the available scans. In 101 (82.8%) of 122 PAs with clearly detectable borders of the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch membrane defect, the Bruch membrane defects were smaller than the retinal pigment epithelium defects. A dome-shape inward bulging of the sclera was observed in 10 PAs., CONCLUSION: These morphological findings may provide a basis for exploring the biomechanical etiology of the PAs as part of the development of pathologic myopia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pathological myopia is one of the leading causes of blindness globally. Lower birth weight (BW) within the normal range has been reported to increase the risk of myopia, although findings conflict. We sought to estimate the causal effect of BW on refractive error using Mendelian randomisation (MR), under the assumption of a linear relationship., METHODS: Genetic variants associated with BW were identified from meta-analysis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for self-reported BW in 162 039 UK Biobank participants and a published Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium GWAS (n=26 836). We performed a one-sample MR analysis in 39 658 unrelated, adult UK Biobank participants (independent of the GWAS sample) using an allele score for BW as instrumental variable. A two-sample MR sensitivity analysis and conventional ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses were also undertaken., RESULTS: In OLS analysis, BW showed a small, positive association with refractive error: +0.04 D per SD increase in BW (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07; p=0.002). The one-sample MR-estimated causal effect of BW on refractive error was higher, at +0.28 D per SD increase in BW (95% CI 0.05 to 0.52, p=0.02). A two-sample MR analysis provided similar causal effect estimates, with minimal evidence of directional pleiotropy., CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests lower BW within the normal range is causally associated with a more myopic refractive error. However, the impact of the causal effect was modest (range 1.00 D covering approximately 95% of the population). Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term results of autologous retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid transplantation (RPE-choroid patch) for exudative and atrophic maculopathies., METHODS: Consecutive chart review of 120 eyes, which underwent RPE-choroid patch, from 2007 to 2017 for RPE atrophy or choroidal neovascular membrane secondary to exudative and hemorrhagic age-related macular degeneration, myopia, angioid streaks, and laser. Eyes were tested with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), reading ability, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography, autofluorescence, and microperimetry., RESULTS: Eighty-eight eyes of 84 patients had complete data, with 2- to 10-year follow-up. Mean age was 71.9 +/- 9.06 years. Mean preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/320 (1.2 +/- 0.2 logMAR) and 20/200 (0.94 +/- 0.36 logMAR), respectively (P = 0.009). Reading ability recovered in 43% of cases. Microperimetry showed central fixation. A gain of at least 15 letters was obtained in 40% of eyes. Integrity (P = 0.009) of external limiting membrane and higher preoperative BCVA (P = 0.001) predicted better final BCVA. Complications were retinal detachment (11.4%), macular atrophy (7%), subretinal hemorrhage (4.5%), epiretinal membrane (4.5%), recurrent choroidal neovascular membrane (4.5%), macular hole (3.4%), and cystoid edema (3%)., CONCLUSION: Autologous RPE-choroid patch achieved long-lasting BCVA improvement and central fixation, in eyes with choroidal neovascular membrane and intact external limiting membrane. Atrophic maculopathies only obtained temporary visual benefit.

N2  - This study aimed to investigate the protein expression profile of vitreous humor (VH) from pathologic myopic retinoschisis (PMRS) patients with or without intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy. VH samples from PMRS patients were subjected to proteomic analysis. Clinical data, including visual acuity, refractive error, and axial length, were recorded, and the fundus optical coherence tomography was performed. Seven PMRS patients were enrolled: 3 PMRS patients as control group, 3 PMRS patients with coexisting choroidal neovascularization (CNV) who developed retinoschisis aggravation after multiple intravitreal conbercept (IVC) injections, and one PMRS patient with coexisting CNV without leakage CNV (CNV-). A total of 310 differentially expressed proteins were identified in these VH samples. The expression of 28 proteins, related to cellular adhesion, protease inhibitors, proangiogenic factors, and antiangiogenic factors, was significantly downregulated in the IVC-treated eyes than in control- and CNV-eyes. alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression was significantly upregulated in the IVC-treated eyes. Furthermore, the expression of alphaA-crystallin and fibrillin-1 was significantly upregulated in both IVC and CNV-eyes than in control eyes. These suggest that multiple IVC injections may increase the VH alphaSMA concentration, which may contribute to posterior hyaloid membrane or retinal inner limiting membrane contraction. Label-free proteomics is an efficient method to provide further insight into the pathogenesis of vitreoretinal diseases.

N2  - Purpose: High myopia (HM) is defined as a refractive error worse than -6.00 diopter (D). This study aims to update the phenotypic and genotypic landscape of nonsyndromic HM and to establish a biological link between the phenotypic traits and genetic deficiencies., Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 731 participants varying in refractive error, axial length (AL), age, myopic retinopathy, and visual impairment. The phenotypic traits were analyzed by four ophthalmologists while mutational screening was performed in eight autosomal causative genes. Finally, we assessed the clinical relevance of identified mutations under the guidance of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics., Results: The relationship between refractive error and AL varied in four different age groups ranging from 3- to 85-years old. In adult groups older than 21 years, 1-mm increase in AL conferred 10.84% higher risk of pathologic retinopathy (Category >=2) as well as 7.35% higher risk of low vision (best-corrected visual acuities <0.3) with P values < 0.001. The prevalence rates of pathologic retinopathy and low vision both showed a nonlinear positive correlation with age. Forty-five patients were confirmed to harbor pathogenic mutations, including 20 novel mutations. These mutations enriched the mutational pool of nonsyndromic HM to 1.5 times its previous size and enabled a statistically significant analysis of the genotype-phenotype correlation. Finally, SLC39A5, CCDC111, BSG, and P4HA2 were more relevant to eye elongation, while ZNF644, SCO2, and LEPREL1 appeared more relevant to refracting media., Conclusions: Our findings shed light on how multiple HM-related phenotypes are associated with each other and their link with gene variants.

N2  - Background: Posterior pole staphylomata (PSS) is an outward bulging of ocular wall, rarely reported in association with inherited retinal degenerations. Patients and methods: We report a large French family of Jewish ancestry with a peculiar form of dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and posterior pole staphyloma (PPS). Eight members were clinically and genetically examined. Results: All affected members complained of night blindness from early childhood and their ERGs were extinguished in the first decade of life. Seven out of eight presented PPS on fundus examination and SD-OCT. The youngest patient did not present PPS at 11 months of age, but the signs of posterior pole bowing became evident at age 8 years. There was no association between the presence of PPS and refraction. Patients with PPS were either hyperopic or myopic, but all have a high with-the-rule astigmatism. A myopic shift was observed for all of them at follow-up. In this family, the disease segregated with the c.886A>G mutation in RHO gene. Conclusion: A PPS development was observed in initially non-myopic patients of a family with unusually severe dominant RP. The PPS concerned only the area with relatively preserved outer retinal layers (outer nuclear layer and ellipsoid zone). How the outer retina could guide choroid and scleral remodelling remains unclear.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the added predictive ability of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in refraction prediction in children and investigate the earliest age threshold for an accurate prediction of high myopia., DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1063 first-born twins followed annually between 2006 and 2015 in China. The exposures were genetic factors (parental myopia, SNPs) and environmental factors (near work, outdoor activity)., METHODS: Five linear mixed-effect models, consisting of different combinations of age, gender, genetic, and environmental factors, were built to predict myopia development. All predictions were performed on the basis of spherical equivalent (SE) at baseline and the measurements on the second and third visits., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was SE at the last visit among all subjects, and the secondary outcome measure was the presence of high myopia at the age of 18 years., RESULTS: Mean age of the study population was 10.5+/-2.2 years (range, 7-15 years) at baseline, and 48.6% were male. In linear mixed-effect models, age, age square, gender, paternal SE, maternal SE, and genetic risk scores (GRSs) showed a significant fixed effect, whereas outdoor and near-work time were not significant to SE at the last visit. Incorporating more follow-up data into the model showed better performance across all models. In the prediction of the presence of high myopia at 18 years of age, the model consisting of only age and gender showed a good performance (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.95), whereas the addition of SNPs did not enhance the model performance significantly. The AUC for predicting high myopia was >0.95 after the age of 13 years for participants with a single visit and after the age of 12 years for those with 1 more visit data., CONCLUSIONS: A simple model incorporating age, sex, and relevant refraction data is sufficient to accurately predict high myopia; there was limited improvement in the prediction model after adding genetic information. Furthermore, this prediction on the outcome at 18 years is possible when the child is aged 12 to 13 years. Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology. All rights reserved.

N2  - Purpose: We investigate the impact of parental myopia on spherical equivalent (SE) progression and axial length (AL) elongation., Methods: Children and their parents were invited for annual examinations from 2006 (baseline). Cycloplegic autorefraction and AL were measured at each visit. Parental refractive status was determined using refraction data from their baseline visit. Children were classified into five groups: no myopic parents (non-non), only one moderately myopic parent (non-moderate), only one highly myopic parent (non-high), two moderately myopic parents (moderate-moderate), and one moderately myopic or more severe and one highly myopic parent (moderate-high/high-high). The relationship between progression of SE and AL with parental refractive status was estimated by linear mixed-effects models. Data from 2006 to 2017 were analyzed in the current study., Results: A total of 1831 children were enrolled (mean age, 11 +/- 2.7 years; mean standard error, -0.49 +/- 2.16 diopters [D] at baseline. Myopia progressed faster for children with parental myopia (non-non group as reference, all P < 0.05), while AL elongation mirrored the change in SE (all P < 0.001 except for non-mod group P = 0.12). As for the age-specific change in SE and AL, children in the mod-high/high-high group presented with the fastest progression. Children with highly myopic parents were at higher risks of being highly myopic during adulthood (odds ratio = 13.98 and 25.71 for non-high and mod-high/high-high groups; both P < 0.001)., Conclusions: SE progresses and AL elongates at a faster rate at an earlier age in children with parental myopia. Children with highly-myopic parents have higher risks of being highly myopic during adulthood.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the characteristics, mergers, and risk factors of different types of myopic maculopathy (MM) in a highly myopic population., DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study., METHODS: A total of 1086 eyes (762 patients) were enrolled. Each participant underwent detailed ocular examinations. Combining the fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography images, types of MM were assessed as myopic atrophy maculopathy (MAM), myopic tractional maculopathy (MTM), or myopic neovascular maculopathy (MNM) according to the ATN classification system. Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) area, tilt ratio, and macular choroidal thickness (mChT) were measured individually., RESULTS: Eyes with larger PPA area were more likely to have MAM (odds ratio [OR], 1.220; P = .037 per 1-mm2 increase) and MNM (OR, 1.723; P < .001 per 1-mm2 increase), and eyes with thicker mChT were less likely to have MAM (OR, 0.740; P < .001 per 10-mum increase) and MNM (OR, 0.784; P < .001 per 10-mum increase), whereas eyes with higher tilt ratio were less likely to have MTM (OR, 0.020; P < .001 per 1 increase). The severity of MTM and MNM was not precisely consistent with that of MAM., CONCLUSIONS: Different types of MM have different risk factors; larger PPA area and thinner mChT are risk factors for MAM and MNM, whereas lower tilt ratio is a risk factor for MTM. Our results indicate that the pathogenesis of MTM is different from that of MAM and MNM, and a tractional component should be considered as a possible component to the myopic macular classification.

N2  - A 54-year-old patient presented with cataract, 5 years after undergoing SMILE for high myopia in both eyes. He was motivated in achieving spectacle free vision and his post SMILE-induced aberrations were minimal, due to which he was found suitable for a trifocal IOL implant. Of the various methods considered, the IOL power predicted by a novel combined telecentric keratometry and swept source OCT-based method was finally selected. One month post-operatively, the patient achieved a binocular UDVA of 20/20p and near vision of N.6, suggesting that newer IOL formulae could be superior in providing satisfactory outcomes in post refractive patients.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the association between choroidal thickness and persistent subretinal fluid (PSF) after surgery for recent-onset rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD)., DESIGN: Case-control study., PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen eyes with macula-off RRD (with fovea on and off) that achieved retinal reattachment on funduscopy and demonstrated PSF after surgery (PSF group) were compared with 62 eyes with macula-off RRD (with fovea on and off) that did not demonstrate PSF after surgery (non-PSF group)., METHODS: The diagnosis of PSF was made by the detection of subretinal fluid pockets on OCT beyond 6 weeks after surgery. Covariates included baseline demographics, duration of RRD, area of RRD, foveal status, method of subretinal fluid drainage, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes, and choroidal thickness in both eyes. Multivariate regression analysis was performed by adding gender, age, and pathologic myopia into the model. The secondary outcomes included postoperative vision and time to resolution of PSF., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subfoveal choroidal thickness in affected eyes, measured by enhanced depth imaging OCT images., RESULTS: The percentage of eyes that underwent vitrectomy, scleral buckle surgery, and pneumatic retinopexy were 71.4%, 14.3%, and 14.3% in the PSF group, respectively, and 87.1%, 11.3%, and 1.6% in the non-PSF group, respectively. Eyes with PSF showed significantly thicker subfoveal choroid than eyes without PSF (305+/-61 mum vs. 200+/-70 mum, respectively; adjusted difference, 78.6+/-19.1 mum; 95% confidence interval [CI], 40.3-116.8 mum; P < 0.001). The PSF group demonstrated a greater proportion of RPE changes in fellow eyes (30.8% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.03) and significantly worse best-corrected visual acuity at the 12-month follow-up (P = 0.03). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that choroidal thickness of 280 mum or more was a significant factor associated with the presence of PSF (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 13.4; 95% CI, 3.1-34.7 [P = 0.001]., CONCLUSIONS: Persistent subretinal fluid is associated with increased subfoveal choroidal thickness in surgical and fellow eyes and with RPE changes in the fellow eye. This indicates that PSF likely belongs to the pachychoroid spectrum. In affected eyes, PSF tends to persist for more than 1 year and results in delayed visual recovery.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To measure the decentration following SMILE in eyes with high myopic astigmatism and investigate its impact on visual quality., METHODS: The prospective study was conducted to analyze patients who underwent SMILE for correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism >=2.5D (high astigmatism group, HA) at the ophthalmology department, Eye and ENT hospital, Shanghai, China.. Patients with myopic astigmatism < 1.5D served as controls (low astigmatism group, LA). Decentration was measured using a Scheimpflug camera with a difference map of the tangential curvature at 12 months postoperatively. Also the associations between decentration from the coaxial sighted corneal light reflex (CSCLR) and the visual outcomes, correction efficacy of astigmatism, wavefront aberrations and objective scatter index (OSI) were analyzed., RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in the decentered distance between HA and LA in either eyes (OD: HA: 0.18 +/- 0.10 mm, LA: 0.20 +/- 0.14 mm, P = 0.659; OS: HA: 0.22 +/- 0.11 mm, LA: 0.20 +/- 0.11 mm, P = 0.637). The analysis across the three levels of decentration (< 0.1 mm, 0.1-0.2 mm, and > 0.2 mm) showed no significant association between decentration and visual outcomes of predictability, efficiency, safety, MTF cutoff, OSI, SR and OVs in both groups. Also no significant association was observed between decentration and postoperative astigmatism in either group. A significant relationship between the magnitude of decentration and induced coma and spherical aberration was observed in HA., CONCLUSIONS: The amount of decentration between HA and LA groups showed no differences. Decentration > 0.20 mm from CSCLR resulted in greater induction of coma and SA after SMILE in eyes with HA.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling for lamellar macular hole (LMH) with or without macular retinoschisis in highly myopic eyes., METHODS: In this retrospective, consecutive case-control study, 21 highly myopic patients (22 eyes) with LMH were divided into two groups based on preoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT): the "flat group" had no macular retinoschisis (n = 10), and the "retinoschisis group" had macular retinoschisis (n = 12). The average follow-up time was 17.2 +/- 12.6 months. Outcomes were based on 6-month postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), integrity of the ellipsoid zone (EZ), external limiting membrane (ELM), and residual foveal thickness (RFT)., RESULTS: The appearance of the macula on OCT was normalized in 19 eyes (86.3%) at the final follow-up visit. Compared to the flat group, the retinoschisis group presented a significantly higher incidence of epiretinal membrane (p = 0.046) and lower refractive error (p = 0.033), shorter axial length (p = 0.0009), better integrity of ELM and EZ (p = 0.005 and p = 0.005, respectively), and better preoperative and postoperative BCVAs (p = 0.015)., CONCLUSIONS: PPV is an effective method to achieve a high anatomical success, improve postoperative vision, and prevent foveal thinning in highly myopic eyes with LMH. In these eyes, the presence of retinoschisis strongly indicates the need for vitrectomy. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Purpose: To examine trends in the prevalence of myopia and myopic maculopathy in a general Japanese population., Methods: Residents of a Japanese community aged 40 years and older participated in surveys conducted in 2005, 2012, and 2017. Each participant underwent comprehensive eye examinations that included measurements of refractive error, axial lengths, and color fundus photography. Myopic maculopathy was defined according to the criteria of the Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia Study Group classification system. Trends in the prevalence of myopia and myopic maculopathy were tested by using a logistic regression analysis fitted by generalized estimating equations to account for individuals submitting to repeated examination., Results: The age-adjusted frequencies of myopia increased significantly from 2005 to 2017 (myopia, 37.7%-45.8%; high myopia 5.8%-9.5%; all P for trend <0.001). The age-adjusted frequency of an axial length level of 26.5 mm or more increased significantly from 2005 to 2017 (3.6%-6.0%; P for trend <0.001). The age-adjusted prevalence of myopic maculopathy also increased significantly with time (1.6% in 2005, 3.0% in 2012 and 3.6% in 2017; P for trend <0.001). Upward trends were observed in the prevalence of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy and patchy chorioretinal atrophy (all P for trend <0.05)., Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prevalence of myopia and myopic maculopathy, especially diffuse chorioretinal atrophy and patchy chorioretinal atrophy, increased significantly over the past 12 years in a general Japanese population.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the changes in the foveal architecture before and after internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling with and without fovea-sparing ILM peeling (FSIP) during vitrectomy for high myopic retinoschisis by intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT)., METHODS: Qualitative assessments were made of the alterations of the retinal architecture imaged by iOCT following complete ILM peeling (peeled group) or fovea-sparing ILM peeling (FSIP group). A microscope-integrated real-time iOCT device was used to analyze the retinal architectures. The alterations included a worsening of the retinoschisis, development of a foveal detachment, and development of a full thickness macular hole. The changes in the retinal architecture, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were compared between the 2 groups., RESULTS: The medical records of 15 eyes of 15 patients were studied. Complete ILM peeling was performed on 9 of 15 eyes, and 8 of the 9 eyes (89%) showed a worsening of the retinal architectures following the ILM peeling. FSIP was performed on 6 of the 15 eyes, and none of these eyes developed any retinal architectural changes in the iOCT images. The mean postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in eyes that underwent FSIP (20/38) was significantly better than that of preoperative BCVA (20/128; p < 0.05), although the differences in the preoperative BCVA (20/87) and postoperative BCVA (20/55) in the cases that underwent complete ILM peeling were not significant., CONCLUSIONS: The lack of alterations of the foveal architecture and significant improvements in the BCVA after FSIP indicate that FSIP peeling should be considered for eyes with retinoschisis. We recommend that iOCT be used to monitor the retinal architecture during intraocular surgery involving the retina. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the association between axial length (AL) and the prevalence of myopic maculopathy in a general Japanese population., DESIGN: Population-based cross-sectional study., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2790 Hisayama residents 40 years of age or older who consented to participate and had available data of AL and fundus photographs for the right eyes were enrolled in this study., METHODS: Myopic maculopathy was defined as the presence of diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, or macular degeneration. The optimal cutoff values of axial length for identifying myopic maculopathy were estimated from the receiver operating characteristic curve. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a logistic regression analysis., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios of AL for prevalent myopic maculopathy and the optimal cutoff values of AL for detecting myopic maculopathy., RESULTS: Longer AL was associated significantly with prevalence of myopic maculopathy in both genders. The optimal cutoff values of AL for identifying myopic maculopathy were 25.9 mm in men and 25.3 mm in women. Participants with ALs of these values or longer showed a significantly higher OR for myopic maculopathy than those with AL of less than these values (men: OR, 21.23; 95% CI, 8.74-51.57; women: OR, 38.49; 95% CI, 18.03-86.49)., CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that there was a positive association between AL and the likelihood of myopic maculopathy, and the cutoff levels of AL for identifying myopic maculopathy were 25.9 mm in men and 25.3 mm in women. Our findings suggest that patients with AL close to or longer than these values should undergo intensive treatment and detailed ophthalmic follow-up.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the factors affecting axial length (AXL) growth and myopia progression in orthokeratology., METHODS: This prospective, observational study enrolled 28 new orthokeratology lens wearers from a contact lens clinic between March 2016 and March 2017. Among them, 32 eyes of 17 wearers who completed one year of follow-up were finally analyzed. All participants underwent central (C) and peripheral (nasal 30degree [N30] and temporal 30degree [T30]) AXL measurements as well as central and peripheral refraction, ocular aberrations, and corneal topography at baseline and every posttreatment visit. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to assess the associations between AXL change and all independent variables in both eyes., RESULTS: The mean central AXL was 24.21 +/- 0.60 mm and the mean baseline central spherical equivalent refractive error (SER) was -2.43 +/- 0.97 diopters (D). Among all parameters that were significantly associated with AXL change in univariable GEE analyses, the baseline difference in AXL between C and N30 (beta = -0.213, p < 0.001), baseline SER (beta = -0.040, p < 0.033), posttreatment coma (beta = -0.291, p < 0.031), third-order higher-order aberrations (HOAs) (beta = -0.482, p < 0.001), and changes in second-order aberrations (beta = 0.025, p = 0.027) at one year of follow-up were identified as significant factors in multivariable GEE analysis., CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of AXL elongation and myopia progression in orthokeratology lens wear is significantly associated with the peripheral myopization and asymmetric optical changes mostly induced by third-order HOAs.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the temporal effect of toric implantable collamer lens (TICL) implantation and location on corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) over a period of 36 months after surgery., METHODS: ECD [number of cells per square millimeter estimated using the Specular Microscope SP-1P (Topcon Europe Medical B.V., Netherlands)] data were collected from cases deemed suitable for the TICL (VTICMO, VTICM5; STAAR Surgical, Nidau, Switzerland). The preoperative refractive error (sphere and cylinder) ranged from -1.00 to -22.25 diopter sphere and from -0.50 to -5.50 diopter cylinder. ECD was evaluated at preoperative and all postoperative sessions., RESULTS: Key findings were as follows: the mean ECD (+/-SD, 95% confidence interval) was 2720 cells/mm (+/-272, 2620-2820 cells/mm) preoperatively, which was reduced to 2372 cells/mm (+/-325, 2250-2490 cells/mm) at 36 months postoperatively (P < 0.001). Linear regression revealed the following significant correlations between the (1) log of the change in ECD (y1) and log of preoperative ECD (x1) at 2 years postoperatively, y1 = 2.513x1-6.2816 (n = 62, r= 0.3503, P = 0.005); (2) mean ECD (y2) and log time (in months, x2), y2= 2543.7-36.997x2-38.99x2 (r=-0.9654, n = 7, P = 0.0004); and (3) mean axial distance between the front surface of the crystalline lens and the TICL back surface (y3) and time postoperatively (in months, x3), y3 = 0.1035x3-5.2808x3 +473.18 (r = 0.8512, n = 7, P = 0.015)., CONCLUSIONS: Expected ECD loss after TICL implantation by 2 years postoperatively is predictable. On average, over 3 years after implantation, there is (1) an initial rapid decline in ECD, followed by a gradual fall in the rate of cell loss, and (2) a gradual fall in the distance between the TICL and the crystalline lens by 2 years postoperatively, followed by a reversal by the third year.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab, ranibizumab and aflibercept for patients with choroidal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (cn-AMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), macular oedema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO-MO) and myopic choroidal neovascularisation (m-CNV)., DESIGN: Systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis., METHODS: Multiple databases were searched from inception to 17 August 2017. Eligible head-to-head randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the (anti-VEGF) drugs in adult patients aged >=18 years with the retinal conditions of interest. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias., RESULTS: 19 RCTs involving 7459 patients with cn-AMD (n=12), DMO (n=3), RVO-MO (n=2) and m-CNV (n=2) were included. Vision gain was not significantly different in patients with cn-AMD, DMO, RVO-MO and m-CNV treated with bevacizumab versus ranibizumab. Similarly, vision gain was not significantly different between cn-AMD patients treated with aflibercept versus ranibizumab. Patients with DMO treated with aflibercept experienced significantly higher vision gain at 12 months than patients receiving ranibizumab or bevacizumab; however, this difference was not significant at 24 months. Rates of systemic serious harms were similar across anti-VEGF agents. Posthoc analyses revealed that an as-needed treatment regimen (6-9 injections per year) was associated with a mortality increase of 1.8% (risk ratio: 2.0 [1.2 to 3.5], 2 RCTs, 1795 patients) compared with monthly treatment in cn-AMD patients., CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab was a reasonable alternative to ranibizumab and aflibercept in patients with cn-AMD, DMO, RVO-MO and m-CNV. The only exception was for patients with DME and low visual acuity (<69 early treatment diabetic retinopathy study [ETDRS] letters), where treatment with aflibercept was associated with significantly higher vision gain (>=15 ETDRS letters) than bevacizumab or ranibizumab at 12 months; but the significant effects were not maintained at 24 months. The choice of anti-VEGF drugs may depend on the specific retinal condition, baseline visual acuity and treatment regimen., PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015022041.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To analyze the optical coherence tomography (OCT) characteristics and visual outcome of vitrectomy in myopic foveoschisis (MF) patients and identify prognostic factors., METHODS: This study is a retrospective clinical cohort study in tertiary care hospital. Thirty-two eyes of 32 patients who underwent MF-related vitrectomy in were investigated retrospectively. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured at 1 year post surgery and changes in central foveal thickness (CFT) and co-existing macular pathologies, such as foveal detachment (FD), lamellar holes, and macular holes were the main outcome measures. Prognostic factors were identified using multivariate linear regression analysis., RESULTS: Average BCVA (in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) and mean CFT had improved from 0.46 +/- 0.06 to 0.37 +/- 0.07 (P = 0.089) and from 485.72 +/- 164.69 to 341.71 +/- 109.70 (P < 0.001), respectively. Univariate analysis identified baseline BCVA, epiretinal membrane, no coexisting OCT features other than MF, FD on OCT, and gas injection as significantly associated with visual outcome (P < 0.001, 0.014, 0.022, < 0.001, and 0.030). Better baseline BCVA and absence of FD on OCT remained significant (P < 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively) after multivariate analysis., CONCLUSION: Good preoperative visual acuity and absence of FD pre-surgery are important predictors of good visual prognosis. Thus, timely surgical intervention, before development of macular complications, may improve visual outcome after surgical treatment of patients with MF.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK (FS-LASIK) can make ultra-thin corneal flap accurately. MEL 90 excimer laser provides Triple-A ablation mode, which significantly reduces the amount of corneal tissue cutting. This study aimed to investigate the visual and refractive outcomes in patients with high myopia after thin-flap FS-LASIK using the 500 Hz pulse rate of the Triple-A profile., METHODS: This prospective study included 90 eyes from 90 patients received thin-flap FS-LASIK using the 500 Hz pulse rate of the Triple-A profile. According to the pre-operative spherical equivalence (SE), the treated eyes were divided into two groups: the first group (ranged from - 9.0D to - 6.0D) and the second group (ranged from - 11.15D to - 9.0 D). The parameters evaluated pre-operatively and 6 month post-operatively included uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), SE, efficacy and safety index, posterior central elevation, and corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs)., RESULTS: The efficacy indexes were 1.149 +/- 0.150 for the first group and 1.173 +/- 0.136 for the second group (P > 0.05), whereas safety indexes were 1.135 +/- 0.154 and 1.158 +/- 0.137 (P > 0.05) respectively. Moreover, 93.8 and 90.6% of patients had an UDVA of 20/20, 51.2 and 49.8% had a UDVA of 20/16 for the first and second groups, respectively; yet, there were no significant differences between both groups at the 20/20 and the 20/16 levels (P > 0.05). 84 and 100% of the firse group patients had a SE within +/-0.5 D and +/- 1.0 D, and 82 and 100% of the second group patients. There was no significant myopia regression in both groups after 6 months follow-up. At 1, 3 and 6-month after surgery, there were no significant differences in the posterior central elevation between the two groups (P > 0.05). The induction of total HOAs, spherical aberration, and horizontal coma in the first group were significantly less than that in the second group at the 6- month follow-up (P < 0.05), while the differences of the RMS value of vertical coma between both groups were not significant (P > 0.05). The ablation was significantly associated with the post-operative increase in total HOAs, spherical aberration and horizontal coma (P < 0.05),but not with vertical coma (P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that using the Triple-A ablation profile of the MEL 90 excimer laser associated with thin-flap is a safe, efficient, and predictable method to correct SE up to - 11.15D. However, for patients with high myopia, under the premise of ensuring a certain optical zone diameter, the ablation depth should be minimized to reduce the increase of the post-operative HOAs so as to improve the visual quality.

N2  - Myopic foveoschisis (MF) is common in highly myopic eyes with posterior staphyloma, and optical coherence tomography is essential for establishing the diagnosis and monitoring disease progression. Untreated MF may lead to significant visual loss due to secondary complications. Vitrectomy with or without internal limiting membrane peeling followed by gas tamponade is the standard treatment; however, in recent years, new techniques, including macular buckling, have been introduced. We selected a total of 41 articles with 30 describing various modifications of pars plana vitrectomy, six describing the macular buckling technique, and five reporting combined surgery. The present review describes current MF treatment strategies, including outcomes, and provides a comprehensive understanding of current therapeutic options. Early detection and surgical intervention in eyes with specific risk factors may contribute to both improved visual recovery and more favorable anatomical outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease causing progressive degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells. The most severe form of this disease is X-linked RP (XLRP), in which photoreceptor degeneration begins in early childhood and complete blindness often occurs by the fourth decade of life. Two genes commonly associated with XLRP have been previously identified., MATERIAL AND METHODS: One Spanish family with confirmed XLRP was studied for mutations using direct sequencing. A genotype-phenotype correlation with pathologic myopia (PM) is detailed., RESULTS: A new pathogenic mutation in the third exon of the RP GTPase regulator (RPGR) was identified: a variant c212C>G (pSER71*). This mutation appears as a hemizygous variant in the male proband with RP, and as heterozygous variant in the females of this pedigree who invariably exhibit symmetrical PM in both eyes., CONCLUSION: A complete family history allowed determination of the inheritance pattern providing genetic counseling for patients and their families. The geno-phenotypic attributes of this heterozygosity suggest a correlation between RP and PM. This novel mutation would expand the mutation spectrum of RP2 and RPGR, and help to study molecular pathogenesis of RP.

N2  - Purpose: To quantify the thickness of the outer retinal sublayers and choroid in pathological myopia and examine associations between these factors and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)., Methods: The cohort was composed of 21 eyes with emmetropia and 70 eyes with high myopia (49 simple high myopia; 21 pathological myopia). Optical coherence tomography images were segmented to determine macular thicknesses of the choroid and the following outer retinal sublayers: outer plexiform layer (OPL), Henle fiber layer and outer nuclear layer (HFL + ONL), myoid and ellipsoid zone (MEZ), outer segment of photoreceptors (OS), and interdigitation zone and RPE/Bruch complex (IZ + RPE). Correlations between BCVA and thickness of the outer retinal sublayers and choroid were determined., Results: In pathological myopia, the choroid, HFL + ONL, MEZ, and IZ + RPE were thinner than in emmetropia and simple high myopia (P < 0.05). Simple and multiple regression models showed that MEZ thickness was correlated with BCVA (both P < 0.001). The relationship between MEZ thickness and BCVA varied with choroidal thickness (P = 0.006). For a constant MEZ thickness, thinner choroids were associated with worse vision. In the final multiple regression predictive model, MEZ thickness, choroidal thickness, and interaction between MEZ and choroidal thickness (all P < 0.001) were predictors of BCVA., Conclusions: Outer retinal alterations, especially thinning of the MEZ, occurred in pathological myopia. The MEZ thickness was associated with BCVA, and this relationship was affected by choroidal thickness.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the visual outcomes and ocular safety when implanting diffractive trifocal intraocular lenses in a population of high myopic eyes., METHODS: This is a retrospective cumulative clinical study. Two hundred five myopic eyes consecutively operated in the hospitals of Clinica Baviera, Spain, were included. All eyes presented an axial length equal or greater than 26 mm and were treated and examined following the same methodology for at least 2 years. Refractive and visual outcomes and also intraoperative or postoperative complications were tabulated for later analysis. Furthermore, a subjective questionnaire was completed by all patients at the end of the follow-up period., RESULTS: The percentage of eyes that lost two or more lines of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 5.9%, 11.5% and 10.7% 3, 12 and 48 months after surgeries respectively. However, 33% of eyes gained two or more lines of CDVA 2 years after implantation. Excimer laser correction of residual refractive error was performed after implants in 29.75% of eyes. Uncorrected distance visual acuities (UDVAs) were significantly better 1 year (0.10 +/- 0.3 logMAR) and 2 years after the surgeries (0.10 +/- 0.14 logMAR) compared with those estimated 3 months postoperatively (0.14 +/- 0.15 logMAR; Kruskal-Wallis; p < 0.001). Mean near and intermediate uncorrected visual acuities remained stable from the first to the last postoperative visit (Kruskal-Wallis; p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Of the eyes, 27.31% were diagnosed and treated with yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser after being diagnosed as having posterior capsular opacification. Retinal detachment (RD) was diagnosed in six eyes (2.92%)., CONCLUSIONS: Diffractive trifocal IOLs have good efficacy and predictability in high myopic eyes. Retinal concerns should lead the surgeons to explore other alternatives for refractive surgery in young patients without cataracts.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term effect of cataract surgery on highly myopic patients with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and the risk factors associated with MTM progression., METHODS: Highly myopic patients with cataract and MTM were included. Phacoemulsification surgery was performed on patients who had vision loss below 20/63 and were willing to operation. Exclusion criteria included full thickness macular hole, foveal/retinal detachment, history of vitreoretinal surgery, myopic choroidal neovascularization, macular chorioretinal atrophy, peripheral lattice degeneration, incomplete follow up, or intraoperative complications. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination. Optical coherence tomography examinations and microperimetry examinations were performed., RESULTS: A total of 229 patients (mean age: 57 +/- 6 years) were recruited, including 179 operated patients and 50 unoperated patients. Both the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular sensitivity (MS) were significantly improved after cataract surgeries throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.000). No difference was found in the proportion of MTM staging and in the rate of resolving/stable or progressive MTM (p = 0.757) between the operated and the unoperated groups. Of all patients, those with S2 to S4 MTM at baseline had significantly higher risk of progressive MTM (p < 0.001). Patients with absence of posterior vitreous detachment or with longer axial length at baseline had higher risks of progressive MTM., CONCLUSION: Cataract surgery generally improves the BCVA and MS of highly myopic patients with MTM. Preoperative vitreoretinal adhesion, longer axial length, and S2 to S4 MTM are risk factors for progressive MTM. A long-term follow-up on the development of MTM is recommended.

N2  - Purpose: To analyze the frequency and phenotypic variation of AMD in subjects with high myopia (HM), and to describe the clinical course and response to treatment of neovascularization (NV)., Methods: Patients with HM were identified at five retina tertiary referral centers. Inclusion criteria were myopic patients aged 55 years or more with axial lengths equal or greater than 25.5 mm., Results: A total of 874 eyes from 442 HM subjects older than 55 years were identified and 104 eyes of 54 patients (72 +/- 11 years) were included in the study and followed up for 23.5 +/- 19.5 months. The estimated AMD frequency in HM subjects over 55 years was 11.9% (95% confidence interval; 9.8%-14.0%). A total of 34 of 104 eyes were diagnosed with drusen, 22 with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), 28 with both drusen and RPD, and 20 with geographic atrophy. Neovascularization was detected in 52 eyes (50%), and type 1 was the most frequent form (39 eyes, 75%). Overall, NV was treated with 4.6 +/- 2.6 anti-VEGF injections. Eyes with treatment-naive NV at baseline (n = 34) required 3.8 +/- 1.5 anti-VEGF injections during the first year of treatment. This exceeded the injection number in the purely myopic population (1.8 to 3.6 injections for the first year)., Conclusions: This study provides evidence to suggest that older patients with HM are at a significant risk of the dry and neovascular forms of AMD. NV in eyes with HM and AMD required more injections in the first year compared to NV in HM eyes without AMD.

N2  - Myopia is one of the most prevalent eye diseases, and its advanced form, high myopia, is a leading cause of subsequent pathologic myopia, which in turn results in an increased risk of retinal diseases. The prevalence of myopia and high myopia is 28.3% and 4.0% of the global population, respectively, and these numbers are estimated to increase to 49.8% for myopia 9.8% for high myopia by 2050, thus making myopia a severe global socioeconomic problem. The eye shape has been receiving increasing attention as a possible biomarker for myopia. Among several modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently considered to be the best to measure the 3-dimensional eye shape, and one study using MRI revealed that myopic eyes became much larger in all 3 dimensions, but more so in length (0.35 mm/D) than in height (0.19 mm/D) or in width (0.10 mm/D), which fitted in global and axial elongation models. Another recent study reported that emmetropic retinas were oblate but oblateness decreased with myopia progression. According to a study to evaluate eye shapes in high myopia, although all emmetropic eyes had a blunt shape, almost half of the high myopic eyes had a pointed shape. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that abnormal eye shape changes can cause not only simple myopia but also various ocular complications through biomechanical stretching. In this review, we highlight recent findings on eye shape changes in myopic eyes and abnormal eye shapes in pathologic myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To identify the accurate clinical diagnosis of rare syndromic inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) based on the combination of clinical and genetic analyses., METHODS: Four unrelated families with various autosomal recessive syndromic inherited retinal diseases were genetically investigated using whole-exome sequencing (WES)., RESULTS: Two affected subjects in family MOL0760 presented with a distinctive combination of short stature, developmental delay, congenital mental retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Subjects were clinically diagnosed with suspected Kabuki syndrome. WES revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.5492dup, p.Asn1831Lysfs*8) in VPS13B that is known to cause Cohen syndrome. The index case of family MOL1514 presented with both RP and liver dysfunction, suspected initially to be related. WES identified a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.1787_1788del, p.His596Argfs*47) in AGBL5, associated with nonsyndromic RP. The MOL1592 family included three affected subjects with crystalline retinopathy, skin ichthyosis, short stature and congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and were found to harbour a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.682C>T, p.Arg228Cys) in ALDH3A2, reported to cause Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS). In the fourth family, SJ002, two siblings presented with hypotony, psychomotor delay, dysmorphic facial features, pathologic myopia, progressive external ophthalmoplegia and diffuse retinal atrophy. Probands were suspected to have atypical Kearns-Sayre syndrome, but were diagnosed with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-20 due to a novel suspected missense variant (c.1691C>T, p.Ala564Val) in VARS2., CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize the important complement of WES and thorough clinical investigation in establishing precise clinical diagnosis. This approach constitutes the basis for personalized medicine in rare IRDs. Copyright © 2019 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the 2-year changes in myopic maculopathy and its associations in highly myopic eyes., Methods: This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study involving 657 Chinese participants with bilateral high myopia (<= -6.00 diopters spherical power), who were followed for 2 years. The worst eye of each participant was considered for the analysis. Myopic maculopathy was graded based on fundus photographs, using the International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy., Results: The mean baseline age was 21.6 +/- 12.2 years (range, 6.8-69.7 years). Myopic maculopathy progressed in 97 (14.8%) of 657 eyes, of which 24 eyes progressed to a higher category of myopic maculopathy, including from no maculopathy to tessellated fundus in 17 eyes, from tessellated fundus to diffuse atrophy in 6 eyes, and from diffuse to patchy atrophy in 1 eye. Among 122 lesion changes identified, the most common changes were enlargement of diffuse atrophy (n = 50, 41.0%), appearance of lacquer cracks (n = 28, 23.0%), enlargement of patchy atrophy (n = 10, 8.2%) and development of additional lacquer cracks (n = 7, 5.8%). In addition, we identified 1 eye with enlargement of a Fuch's spot, and 1 eye with active choroidal neovascularization. In multiple logistic regression analysis, myopic maculopathy progression was associated with older age, longer axial length, greater change in myopic spherical equivalent and more severe myopic maculopathy at baseline., Conclusions: Myopic maculopathy progressed in approximately 15% of highly myopic eyes over a 2-year period. Further studies with longer follow up periods are required to confirm identified risk factors for progression.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Ocular dysfunctions and toxicities induced by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are rarely reviewed and not frequently received attention by treating physicians compared to other adverse effects (e.g. endocrinologic, cognitive and metabolic). However, some are frequent and progressive even in therapeutic concentrations or result in permanent blindness. Although some adverse effects are non-specific, others are related to the specific pharmacodynamics of the drug. Areas covered: This review was written after detailed search in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web, SciELO, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register databases (from 1970 to 2019). It summarized the reported ophthalmologic adverse effects of the currently available AEDs; their risks and possible pathogenic mechanisms. They include ocular motility dysfunctions, retinopathy, maculopathy, glaucoma, myopia, optic neuropathy, and impaired retinal vascular autoregulation. In general, ophthalmo-neuro- or retino-toxic adverse effects of AEDs are classified as type A (dose-dependent), type B (host-dependent or idiosyncratic) or type C which is due to the cumulative effect from long-term use. Expert opinion: Ocular adverse effects of AEDs are rarely reviewed although some are frequent or may result in permanent blindness. Increasing knowledge of their incidence and improving understanding of their risks and pathogenic mechanisms are crucial for monitoring, prevention, and management of patients' at risk.

N2  - Vitrectomy combined with internal limiting membrane peeling (ILMP) treats high myopic foveoschisis with good results, but there is a risk of iatrogenic macular holes, which may be reduced by preserving the internal limiting membrane of the central fovea. This study compared complete ILMP with partial ILMP, both combined with 25G vitrectomy, for the treatment of high myopic foveoschisis.Thirty-three cases (33 eyes) of high myopic foveoschisis were retrospectively analyzed. They underwent 25G vitrectomy combined with C3F8 gas filling; Group A (20 patients, 20 eyes) underwent complete ILMP, while Group B (13 patients, 13 eyes) underwent partial ILMP to preserve the internal limiting membrane of the central fovea. Patients were followed up for 6 months and underwent best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure, diopter, slit lamp microscopy, indirect ophthalmoscope, A-mode and/or B-mode ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography. Surgical complications were recorded.Up to the last follow-up, the BCVA improved and central fovea thickness (CFT) was lower compared with before surgery in both groups (All P < .05). There were no significant differences in BCVA and CFT at each time point between the groups (P > .05). Most of the postoperative retinas of the 2 groups were completely reattached, with disappearance of the macular retinoschisis cavity. Two patients in the Group A and none in the Group B developed a macular hole during follow-up (P = .508). The results did not support the superiority of partial ILMP over complete ILMP in reduced incidence of macular hole. Both methods had a similar curative effect.

N2  - We investigated the clinical characteristics of cilioretinal arteries (CAs) and cilioretinal veins (CVs) in eyes with pathologic myopia. Ninety-five eyes with pathologic myopia and CAs were studied. The retrobulbar vessels from which the CAs originated were identified by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). The results showed that 114 CAs were identified in the 95 eyes. ICGA showed that 60% of the CAs branched directly off the short posterior ciliary arteries (SPCAs) and 40% originated from the Zinn-Haller arterial circle (ZHAC). The SPCA-derived CAs tended to be located superiorly and served a large retinal area whereas the ZHAC-associated CAs tended to be located temporally and served mainly the macular area. In 15% of the 95 eyes, the CVs were observed to run parallel to the CAs. The CVs exited the eye at the same point where the CAs entered the eye. This study showed that CAs in eyes with pathologic myopia can be divided into those that are SPCA-derived and tend to emerge in the superior optic disc sector, and those that are ZHAC-associated and usually emerge temporally. An elongating peripapillary scleral flange in eyes with progressive axial myopia may lead to a change of chorioretinal vascular system.

N2  - AIMS: To evaluate the prevalence of myopic maculopathy among participants aged 50 years and older in rural southern China., METHODS: Population-based, cross-sectional study. Subjects were recruited using cluster sampling from Yangxi County, Guangdong Province, China from August to November in 2014. Non-cycloplegic autorefraction and fundus photography were performed on all of the participants. Myopic maculopathy was graded based on fundus photographs using the International Classification of Myopic Maculopathy., RESULTS: Among 5825 individuals who participated (90.7% response rate), a total of 4469 participants with gradable fundus photographs for myopic maculopathy and automated refractive data were included in this study. The mean age of these participants was 65.50+/-9.70 years. The crude prevalence of myopic maculopathy was 1.4% (62/4469; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0% to 1.8 %) and age-standardised prevalence was 1.2% (95% CI 1.1% to 1.2%). Diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, lacquer cracks and staphyloma were observed in 43 (1.0%), 3 (0.1%), 1 (0.1%), 15 (0.3%) and 8 eyes (0.2%), respectively. Myopic maculopathy was more common in eyes of older participants (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.11) and more myopic spherical equivalence (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.57 to 1.84)., CONCLUSION: The prevalence of myopic maculopathy was low among the rural southern Chinese population. Diffuse chorioretinal atrophy was the most common retinal finding among Chinese myopes. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab compared with best supportive care (BSC; considered to be no active treatment) for the treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with causes other than neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and pathologic myopia (PM) in a UK setting., METHODS: An individual patient-level simulation model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of ranibizumab vs. BSC. Regression analyses, performed on patient-level data collected within the pivotal phase III MINERVA trial, modelled visual acuity (VA) progression while patients remained on treatment. Patient utilities were modelled as a function of VA in both eyes and resource use estimates were based on trial data or the literature. Costs were evaluated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and personal social services, with future costs and health outcomes discounted at 3.5% per annum. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted., RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for intravitreal ranibizumab was 1363 per QALY compared to BSC and was associated with an incremental benefit of 1.06 QALYs and an incremental cost of 1444 per patient. Drug and administration costs of intravitreal ranibizumab were offset by the prevention of the development of blindness and its associated costs, while the increase in benefits was driven by a reduction in mortality risk and an improved health-related quality of life attributed to an improvement in VA. The findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses and ranibizumab consistently remained cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000-30,000 per QALY gained for all sensitivity analyses., CONCLUSION: Intravitreal ranibizumab is a highly cost-effective intervention for the treatment of CNV due to causes other than nAMD and PM as it delivers substantial QALY gains to patients while making cost savings vs. BSC., FUNDING: Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd.

N2  - PURPOSE: To analyze the choroidal thickness (CT) of each type of myopic maculopathy, and to establish an OCT-based classification of myopic maculopathy., DESIGN: Retrospective, hospital-based, cross-sectional study., PARTICIPANTS: Highly myopic (HM) eyes that were examined by swept-source OCT., METHODS: The CT was measured at the subfovea and at 3 mm nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior to the fovea. Myopic maculopathy was classified as tessellation, diffuse atrophy, patchy atrophy, and macular atrophy (MA) based on the fundus photographs. Diffuse atrophy was subdivided into peripapillary diffuse choroidal atrophy (PDCA) or macular diffuse choroidal atrophy (MDCA)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The CT of each type of myopic maculopathy and cut-off value for diagnosis of diffuse atrophy., RESULTS: We studied 1487 eyes of 884 patients (mean age: 58 years; mean axial length [AxL]: 29.9 mm). Subfoveal CT decreased with an increase in the severity of the myopic maculopathy. The mean subfoveal CT in HM eyes with normal fundus was 274.5 mum, with tessellation was 129.1 mum, with PDCA was 84.6 mum, with MDCA was 50.2 mum, with patchy atrophy was 48.6 mum, with choroidal neovascularization-related MA was 27.3 mum, and with patchy atrophy-related MA was 3.5 mum. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal CT to predict the presence of PDCA was 56.5 mum nasally, and the CT to predict the presence of MDCA was 62 mum subfoveally. The subfoveal CT was not significantly different in eyes with MDCA and patchy atrophy. A decrease of the subfoveal CT was associated with an older age (P < 0.001), longer AxL (P < 0.001), presence of myopic maculopathy (P < 0.001), and presence of CNV (P = 0.002). A decrease of best-corrected visual acuity was not significantly associated with the subfoveal CT., CONCLUSIONS: Progressive and continuous choroidal thinning plays a key role in the progression from no maculopathy to tessellation and to diffuse atrophy. The cut-off value of CT can be used for diagnosing PDCA and MDCA. For progression from MDCA to patchy atrophy, factors other than further choroidal thinning such as Bruch membrane defect may be involved. The subfoveal CT was not a predictor of visual acuity in HM eyes without CNV. Copyright © 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate criteria driving retreatment with ranibizumab in Italian patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV)., METHODS: OLIMPIC was a 12-month, phase IIIb, open-label study. Patients with active mCNV were treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg according to the European label. The study assessed local criteria in Italy driving retreatment decisions with ranibizumab; and the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ranibizumab., RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of treated patients (N = 200) was 61.8 (12.7) years; range 22-85 years. The multivariate regression model indicated that presence of active leakage (odds ratio [OR] 95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.30 [1.03-124.14]), presence of intraretinal fluid (OR [95%CI]: 28.21 [1.55-513.73]), and an improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline < 10 letters (OR [95%CI]: 17.60 [1.39-222.75]) were the factors with the greatest effect on retreatment with ranibizumab. The mean (SD) BCVA gain from baseline to month 12 was 8.4 (12.8) letters (P < 0.0001). The mean (SD) number of injections was 2.41 (1.53); range 1-9. Ocular and non-ocular adverse events were reported in 41 (20.5%) and 30 (15.0%) patients, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Individualized treatment with ranibizumab was effective in improving BCVA in patients with mCNV over 12 months. Both anatomical and functional variables had significant effects on causing retreatment. There were no new safety findings., TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ClinicalTrials.Gov (NCT No: NCT02034006).

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) progression in myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) between intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (IVR) and aflibercept (IVA) in the eyes with mCNV., METHODS: Thirty eyes (28 patients) with treatment-naive mCNV were included in this study. IVR or IVA was administered for up to 1 year. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured, and fundus photographs and fundus autofluorescence were obtained before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the initial treatment. The clinical characteristics including the macular choroidal thickness in various areas and CRA progression were compared between the drugs. The clinical characteristics and macular choroidal thicknesses were compared between eyes with and without CRA progression., RESULTS: The BCVA improved significantly (p < 0.05 for all comparisons) from 0.44 to 0.26, 0.19, 0.20, and 0.17 after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. CRA progressed in 12 (40%) eyes over 1 year. The CRA progression did not differ significantly between aflibercept and ranibizumab. The foveal choroid was significantly (p = 0.0043) thinner in aflibercept-treated eyes compared with ranibizumab-treated eyes at 1 year. Subfoveal CNV tended to cause CRA progression more frequently at 1 year, although this did not reach significance., CONCLUSIONS: IVA to treat mCNV caused more severe thinning of the foveal choroid than ranibizumab; however, no significant difference was seen in CRA progression between the drugs and the choroidal thickness should not be associated with CRA progression. The CNV location may predict CRA progression after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for mCNV.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term visual and refractive outcomes, optical quality, and stability of the cornea and axial length after small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) for the correction of high myopia with a maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10.00 diopters (D)., METHODS: Via a prospective cohort study, 53 eyes (53 patients) with a maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10.00 D were corrected with a VisuMax femtosecond laser (version 3.0; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center of Sun Yat-sen University. Refractive outcomes, aberrations, axial length, and corneal curvature were evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 15 months postoperatively., RESULTS: At 15 months postoperatively, the efficacy and safety indexes were 0.91 +/- 0.25 and 1.15 +/- 0.18, respectively. A total of 72% of eyes were within +/-0.50 D and 89% were within +/-1.00 D of the attempted spherical equivalent, respectively. From 1 to 15 months postoperatively, the significant regression was -0.24 +/- 0.28 D (P < .001) on manifest refraction and -0.43 +/- 0.54 D (P < .001) on anterior corneal curvature. In addition, a significant increase of 0.20 microm (P = .016) was observed in the spherical aberration. No significant change was observed in posterior corneal curvature (P > .999), including mean keratometry or astigmatism, or in the ocular axis length from 1 to 15 months postoperatively (26.82 +/- 0.93 and 26.82 +/- 0.95 mm, respectively, P > .99)., CONCLUSIONS: SMILE had long-term safety, efficacy, and predictability when treating high myopia with a maximum myopic meridian exceeding 10.00 D. Both a manifest refraction regression of -0.24 D and a significant spherical aberration increase of 0.20 microm were observed between 1 and 15 months postoperatively, due to the increased anterior corneal curvature.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: The optimal treatment regimen for myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) is essential to understand but currently poorly studied., BACKGROUND: To date, there is still no consensus on the optimal dosage and frequency of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections in treating mCNV., DESIGN: A prospective, single-centre, single-blind, randomized controlled study., PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with active mCNV., METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to one or three doses initial ranibizumab treatments. Additional injections were administered pro re nata (prn) over 12 mo., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and frequency of injections., RESULTS: Fifty patients participated in the study. Patients in both 1 + prn or 3 + prn groups experienced similar best-corrected visual acuity gain and anatomical improvement, including central retinal thickness (CRT), CNV thickness, area of CNV and area of leakage. Over 12 mo, patients in the 1 + prn group received fewer ranibizumab injections (2.04 +/- 1.22) compared with the 3 + prn group (3.58 +/- 0.72, P<0.0001), but no statistic difference of the injection received was observed in the prn period. During the follow-up, 15 of 26 eyes in the 1 + prn group and 10 of 24 eyes in the 3 + prn group received additional injections after initial dosing (P = 0.2575). Cox regression analysis showed that 1 + prn, female, age > 55 y and CRT > 300 mum are risk factors for retreatment., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The eyes with a single loading dose achieved parallel anatomical and functional visual improvement, while required less injections over 1 y. The risk factors for retreatment include 1 + prn, female, older age and thick retina thickness. Copyright © 2018 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.

N2  - PURPOSE: We estimated the potential global economic productivity loss resulting from vision impairment (VI) and blindness as a result of uncorrected myopia and myopic macular degeneration (MMD) in 2015., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the economic burden of VI associated with myopia is critical to addressing myopia as an increasingly prevalent public health problem., METHODS: We estimated the number of people with myopia and MMD corresponding to critical visual acuity thresholds. Spectacle correction coverage was analyzed against country-level variables from the year of data collection; variation in spectacle correction was described best by a model based on a human development index, with adjustments for urbanization and age. Spectacle correction and myopia data were combined to estimate the number of people with each level of VI resulting from uncorrected myopia. We then applied disability weights, labor force participation rates, employment rates, and gross domestic product per capita to estimate the potential productivity lost among individuals with each level and type of VI resulting from myopia in 2015 in United States dollars (US$). An estimate of care-associated productivity loss also was included., RESULTS: People with myopia are less likely to have adequate optical correction if they are older and live in a rural area of a less developed country. The global potential productivity loss associated with the burden of VI in 2015 was estimated at US$244 billion (95% confidence interval [CI], US$49 billion-US$697 billion) from uncorrected myopia and US$6 billion (95% CI, US$2 billion-US$17 billion) from MMD. Our estimates suggest that the Southeast Asia, South Asia, and East Asia Global Burden of Disease regions bear the greatest potential burden as a proportion of their economic activity, whereas East Asia bears the greatest potential burden in absolute terms., CONCLUSIONS: Even under conservative assumptions, the potential productivity loss associated with VI and blindness resulting from uncorrected myopia is substantially greater than the cost of correcting myopia.

N2  - The appearance of tessellated fundus in an eye may act as a marker in identifying visual performance, degree of myopia or risk of progression of myopia in a given eye. A systematic literature search using key words was performed using PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar and of the 832 studies identified, 10 full-length articles, which met the inclusion criteria, were considered for review. The primary outcome measures were association of tessellated fundus with: (i) visual acuity, (ii) refractive error, (iii) axial length, (iv) choroidal thickness and (v) future progression of myopia when compared to either no myopic maculopathy, or more severe myopic maculopathy. There was no significant difference in the visual acuity noted between eyes with normal fundus and tessellated fundus appearance. Compared to eyes with tessellated fundus, eyes with more severe myopic maculopathy had a four-line decrease in best-corrected visual acuity, more myopia (mean difference 2.75 D, range 0.28-5.78 D) and a longer axial length (mean difference 2 mm, range 2.29 to 1.71 mm). Eyes with tessellated fundus generally exhibited a significant decrease in choroidal thickness compared to eyes with no maculopathy. In mostly older individuals, eyes with tessellated fundus had a better outcome with respect to visual acuity, degree of myopia and axial length compared to other severe myopic maculopathies, but had a worse outcome for choroidal thickness and degree of myopia, compared to eyes with no myopic maculopathy. The features such as reduced choroidal thickness combined with a predilection to infra-temporal and parapapillary regions may indicate regions of stress that are prone to more stretching/atrophic changes. This systematic review demonstrated an association of tessellated fundus with visual acuity, refractive error, axial length and choroidal thickness and hence emphasises the documentation of the presence and location of tessellated fundus appearance that may help in predicting the progression of myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To characterize the choriocapillaris (CC) in highly myopic eyes with myopic maculopathy, using optical coherence tomographic angiography., METHODS: Prospective, clinic-based study of 42 eyes of 38 patients with high myopia (<=-6 diopters and axial length >=26.5 mm). Myopic maculopathy was graded from fundus photographs according to the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia classification. Macular 3 x 3 mm en face optical coherence tomographic angiographic images were obtained with swept-source optical coherence tomographic angiography and graded for CC flow impairment as follows: 1) intact CC, 2) focal (<1 mm), and 3) extensive (>1 mm)., RESULTS: Of the 42 eyes, 17 (39.5%) had tessellated fundus, 20 (46.5%) had diffuse, and 6 (14.0%) had patchy atrophy. Choriocapillaris flow impairment was observed in all eyes with diffuse and patchy atrophy. Even in eyes with tessellated fundus only, CC signal voids were seen in 3 eyes (17.6%). With increasingly severe myopic maculopathy, the pattern of CC flow impairment changed from predominantly focal to predominantly extensive., CONCLUSION: Choriocapillaris flow impairment was observed in many highly myopic eyes, even in those with mild fundus changes, and worsened with increasing severity of myopic maculopathy. Longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether CC flow impairment predicts the risk of myopic maculopathy progression.

N2  - PURPOSE: To observe features of the posterior vitreous and vitreoretinal interface in highly myopic eyes with retinoschisis using enhanced vitreous imaging optical coherence tomography., METHODS: Comprehensive ophthalmologic examination and enhanced vitreous imaging optical coherence tomography were performed in 77 eyes of 63 patients with highly myopic retinoschisis. Two different modes of spectral domain optical coherence tomography were employed to estimate retinoschisis and the posterior vitreous features in optical coherence tomography images, respectively. The types and distribution of vitreoretinal interface abnormalities were also analyzed., RESULTS: Complete posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) was identified in 55 eyes (71.4%) with a Weiss ring. Residual cortex was found in 39 eyes (70.9%) with complete PVD. Vitreoretinal interface changes, including vitreoretinal adhesion and epiretinal membrane (ERM), most frequently appeared in the macular area (47.3%), followed by the inferior arched vessels region (34.5%). In partial PVD eyes, vitreoretinal traction, vitreoretinal adhesion, and epiretinal membrane tended to be observed in the inferior and superior arched vessels regions (54.5 and 40.9%, respectively). Among all types of vitreoretinal interface abnormalities, epiretinal membrane comprised the largest proportion (46.8%) despite the status of PVD. The presence of inner layers of retinoschisis connoted a relatively high possibility of vitreoretinal interface abnormalities occurring., CONCLUSION: Enhanced vitreous imaging optical coherence tomography reveals a high prevalence of vitreoretinal interface abnormalities in highly myopic eyes with retinoschisis. Vitreous cortex tends to remain on the macular area in eyes with complete PVD. Our findings may lead to better guidance for the surgical treatment of highly myopic retinoschisis.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the 5-year outcome of intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) for myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)., METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 51 eyes of 51 consecutive patients with myopic CNV who had been treated with IVR with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years after the initial IVR injection. The factors that predicted the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 5 years after IVR were determined by multiple regression analysis., RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 63.6 years, and the mean axial length was 29.4 mm. The mean number of IVR was 1.6, and 34 eyes (66.7%) had only a single IVR. At the baseline and at the 1-year, 2-year, 4-year, and 5-year period, the mean BCVAs were 20/49, 20/37, 20/41, 20/45, and 20/42, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the BCVA at 5-year period was significantly correlated with the baseline BCVA, the number of IVR injections, and the size of the CNV-related macular atrophy., CONCLUSION: Intravitreal ranibizumab provide a 5-year visual benefit in eyes with myopic CNV compared with the natural course. A lack of enlargement of the CNV-related macular atrophy, a better baseline BCVA, and a minimum number of IVR injections were associated with better visual outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To compare the long-term clinical evolution of highly myopic eyes with vertical oval-shaped dome associated with or without untreated serous retinal detachment., METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with high myopia (40 eyes) with smooth macular elevations related to a vertical oval-shaped dome were recruited. Serous retinal detachment was investigated; 11 eyes had persistent submacular fluid (study group) and 29 eyes lacked submacular fluid (control group). All patients underwent complete ophthalmological examinations, including optical coherence tomography at baseline every 6 months for 2 years. Fluorescein angiographies were performed in cases with serous retinal detachment to rule out choroidal neovascularisation., RESULTS: There were no statistical differences in baseline age, sex, spherical equivalence or axial length between the two groups. Serous retinal detachment always occurred at the top of the inward macular incurvation. Moreover, no statistically significant differences in mean best-corrected visual acuity were observed during the 24-month follow-up period in the study and control groups and between the two groups at all time points. The mean central foveal thickness was significantly higher in the study group at each visit (p=0.001, in all cases). At the final follow-up visit, complete resolution of the serous retinal detachment was achieved in 1 of the 11 study group's eyes., CONCLUSIONS: Serous retinal detachment is a complication associated with vertical oval-shaped domes that seems to remain stable in terms of visual function over time without treatment.

N2  - AIM: To study anatomical and visual outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with non-fovea-sparing (entire) internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in eyes with myopic foveoschisis (MF)., METHODS: Prospective interventional case series of eyes undergoing PPV with entire ILM peeling for symptomatic MF., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) epiretinal membrane, anomalous posterior vitreous detachment, vitreoschisis and postoperative changes in SD-OCT central foveal thickness (CFT), ellipsoid zone defect, foveal detachment (FD), macular hole (MH) diameter (if present) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR)., RESULTS: This study included 21 eyes (21 patients) with mean age 60.4+/-13.1, 15 females (71.4%). All patients achieved complete postoperative reattachment by SD-OCT (no FD) 6 months post vitrectomy, with no iatrogenic intraoperative or postoperative MH, and with significant improvement in final BCVA from 1.6+/-0.30 to1.0+/-0.2 logMAR, and in CFT from 918.2+/-311.4 to182.3+/-33.1 microm. Patients were subdivided into subgroup A: 11 eyes without MH; and subgroup B: 10 eyes with MH, the latter had significant improvement in MH diameter (p=0.005). Preoperative BCVA was a significant risk factor for visual gain, while preoperative FD and CFT were significant for CFT change., CONCLUSION: Vitrectomy with non-fovea-sparing (entire) ILM peeling resulted in a significant functional and anatomical improvement in eyes with MF with/without MH with no reported complications. Results are comparable to fovea-sparing ILM peeling. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to examine the outcomes of transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (Trans-PRK) and Femtosecond Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (Z-LASIK) for the correction of high myopia., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study design was used. The study group included 792 eyes with high-grade myopia (- 6.0 diopters or higher) or high-grade myopia with astigmatism that were treated with Z-LASIK or Trans-PRK in 2013 through 2014 in an optical outpatient clinic of a large private medical service. The Trans-PRK group comprised of 674 eyes with a spherical equivalent (SE) of - 7.87 +/- 1.46 and the Z-LASIK group comprised of 118 eyes with a SE of - 7.19 +/- 0.81 (P < 0.001)., RESULTS: The mean postoperative SE in the Trans-PRK group was - 0.06 and - 0.02 in the Z-LASIK group (P = 0.545). Efficacy index values were 0.92 in the Trans-PRK group and 0.95 in the Z-LASIK group (P = 0.083), and corresponding safety index values were 0.95 and 0.97 (P = 0.056). An UCVA of 20/40 or better was achieved in 94.20% of eyes in the Trans-PRK group, and 98.31% in the Z-LASIK group (P = 0.063). The majority of eyes in both the Trans-PRK and Z-LASIK groups were within +/- 0.5D of attempted correction: 59.35 and 64.71%, respectively (P = 0.271)., CONCLUSIONS: Both Trans-PRK and Z-LASIK demonstrated excellent efficacy, safety and predictability profiles, with results comparable and in some cases superior to the current literature. Results of Z-LASIK were slightly better than those of Trans-PRK, though the preoperative SE of the latter was higher.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the characteristics of retinal telangiectasia in eyes with pathologic myopia., METHODS: The study included 10 patients (18 eyes) who were diagnosed with pathologic myopia combined with retinal telangiectasia. The patients visited our retinal clinic every 3 months. Nine eyes underwent vitrectomy for vision-threatening complications after diagnosis. All eyes underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations including multimodal retinal imaging at presentation and at each follow-up., RESULTS: Retinal telangiectasia in pathologic myopia was characterized by saccular aneurysmal dilatation of the capillary bed without hard exudates in color fundus photographs and hyporeflective saccular structure in infrared reflectance fundus photographs, and it was filled in the early retinal arteriovenous phase with minimal dye leakage in the late phase of fundus fluorescein angiography. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomographic angiography showed that retinal telangiectasia was primarily located in the superficial retina, together with myopic traction maculopathy. In the 9 eyes that underwent vitrectomy, the retinal telangiectasia regressed within 3 months of surgery. Retinal telangiectasia remained stable in the other nine eyes, but these eyes were at risk of spontaneous bleeding., CONCLUSION: Retinal telangiectasia is a relatively quiescent and uncommon disorder in patients with pathologic myopia that might be closely related to myopic traction maculopathy.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study investigated factors associated with persistent serous retinal detachment in highly myopic eyes with vertical oval-shaped domes., METHODS: Twenty-eight highly myopic patients (40 eyes) with smooth macular elevations related to a vertical oval-shaped dome were recruited. Serous retinal detachment was investigated; 11 eyes had persistent submacular fluid (study group) and 29 eyes lacked submacular fluid (control group). All patients underwent complete ophthalmologic examinations, including axial-length measurement and fluorescein angiography. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans through the fovea measured choroidal thicknesses, macular bulge height, and vitreoretinal interface factors., RESULTS: No studied variables (age, sex, spherical equivalence, axial length, vitreomacular traction, epiretinal membrane, and internal limiting membrane detachment) except higher macular bulge height (P = 0.03) and a reduced macular choroidal thickness (P = 0.02) were associated with the risk of serous retinal detachment. No statistically significant differences in best-corrected visual acuity were observed between the study and control groups. Serous retinal detachment always occurred at the top of the inward incurvation of the macula and was characterized by multiple hyperfluorescent granular patches on fluorescein angiography., CONCLUSION: A higher macular bulge height and a reduced macular choroidal thickness might be important factors in the development of serous retinal detachment in patients with vertical oval-shaped domes.

N2  - PURPOSE: Posterior staphyloma is an ocular complication associated with high myopia and reflects degenerative changes on the sclera. Its morphology is associated with chorioretinal atrophy and myopic maculopathy. The purpose of this study was to validate the efficacy of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in providing a simple estimation of the staphyloma pattern., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational case-series study of high myopic patients with posterior staphylomas. Patients were examined using the star scan pattern OCT in different radial planes. Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance tomography was also performed to visualize the anatomical characteristics of the posterior pole. 3D-segmentation and curvature analysis were also performed., RESULTS: Eight patients were totally enrolled in this pilot study. Our study pool consisted of 2 wide macular staphylomas, 2 narrow macular staphylomas, and 4 barrel-shaped staphylomas. Our preliminary results revealed that patients displayed mirror-image distortion in the steeper staphyloma axis. In the barrel-shaped subtype, no image distortion was displayed in any plane., CONCLUSION: We estimated the axis of the smaller base curvature by noting the distortion pattern in the different radial axis. The recognition of pathologic axial myopia is important since there is a risk of permanent vision loss from vision to threatening sequelae.

Y1  - 2018//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a common cause of central visual loss in patients with high myopia, and the most common form of CNV in younger individuals. Pharmacologic therapy is the current mainstay of treatment of these patients., METHODS: Review of pharmacological treatment options for myopic CNV, which primarily involves intravitreal administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents., RESULTS: At this time, anti-VEGF therapy agents are the first-line therapy in these patients. Comparative trials have not identified any major differences in treatment outcomes between aflibercept, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab. Only ranibizumab is approved for this indication in the US. Best visual outcomes are associated with younger age, smaller lesion size, and absence of chorioretinal atrophy., CONCLUSION: Anti-VEGF therapy is generally very effective in the treatment of myopic CNV.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of dome-shaped macula (DSM) in highly myopic eyes among Chinese Han and to detect the correlation with myopic maculopathy and macular complications., METHODS: A total of 736 Chinese Han patients (1384 eyes) with high myopia (refractive error<=6.0 diopters or axial length >=26.5 mm) are reviewed based on information entered into a high-myopia database at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and parafoveal choroidal thickness (PFCT) are measured. The prevalence of DSM in patients with myopic maculopathy is categorised from C0 to C4. Clinical features, including macular complications, SFCT and PFCT, are compared between myopic eyes with and without DSM., RESULTS: Among the 1384 eyes, 149 (10.77%) show DSM. In highly myopic eyes without macular complications, the best corrected visual acuity is significantly worse in patients with DSM (p=0.002), and the ratio between subfoveal and parafoveal choroidal thickness (S/PCT) is significantly elevated in patients with DSM (p=0.021). The proportion of foveal schisis (17.24% vs 62.86%) is much lower in eyes with DSM compared with those without DSM. However, the proportions of extrafoveal schisis (39.66% vs 5.37%), foveal serous retinal detachment (SRD) (5.17% vs 0) and epiretinal membrane (ERM) (24.14% vs 10.74%) are much higher in eyes with DSM. The proportion of DSM was lower in C0 and C1, but higher proportion of DSM was found in C3 and C4., CONCLUSIONS: DSM is found in 10.77% of highly myopic eyes among Chinese Han. DSM might be a protective mechanism for foveal schisis and a risk factor for extrafoveal schisis, SRD and ERM. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

N2  - Purpose: To quantitatively assess the posterior pole shape change in highly myopic eyes and to investigate the factors determining the speed of shape change., Methods: Local curvature of the Bruch's membrane on the optical coherence tomography image was measured at intervals of 1 mum, and the mean curvature and curvature variance were calculated for 1094 eyes with an axial length of >=26 mm. Speed of shape change was calculated using two points of mean curvature and curvature variance, and compared according to age, sex, axial length, and baseline eye shape., Results: The posterior pole shape of females changed significantly greater than males (P < 0.01). Protruding change through the mean curvature was the greatest in the eyes with an axial length of >=28 mm and <29 mm, while undulating change through the curvature variance became greater with axial length elongation in the eyes with an axial length of <29 mm and showed similar change in the eyes with an axial length of >=29 mm. The eyes with a flatter shape at baseline tended to show a slow shape change, whereas those with moderate shape deformation at baseline showed faster shape change., Conclusions: Quantitative evaluation of posterior pole eye shape clearly demonstrated significant time-dependent protruding and undulating changes in highly myopic eyes. Sex, axial length, and baseline posterior pole eye shape significantly affected speed of the posterior pole shape change. Our findings will facilitate risk assessment of staphyloma-associated complications in highly myopic eyes through measurement of speed of the posterior pole shape change.

N2  - A structurally and functionally intact choroid tissue is vitally important for the retina function. Although central retinal artery is responsible to supply the inner retina, choroidal vein network is responsible for the remaining one-third of the external part. Abnormal choroidal blood flow leads to photoreceptor dysfunction and photoreceptor death in the retina, and the choroid has vital roles in the pathophysiology of many diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. Biomarkers of choroidal diseases can be identified in various imaging modalities that visualize the choroid. Indocyanine green angiography enables the visualization of choroid veins under the retinal pigment epithelium and choroidal blood flow. New insights into a precise structural and functional analysis of the choroid have been possible, thanks to recent progress in retinal imaging based on enhanced depth imaging (EDI) and swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) technologies. Long-wavelength SS-OCT enables the choroid and the choroid-sclera interface to be imaged at greater depth and to quantify choroidal thickness profiles throughout a volume scan, thus exposing the morphology of intermediate and large choroidal vessels. Finally, OCT angiography allows a dye-free evaluation of the blood flow in the choriocapillaris and in the choroid. We hereby review different imaging findings of choroidal diseases that can be used as biomarkers of activity and response to the treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognostic value of the development of a hyperreflective envelopment of the neovascular tissue in myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) after the first intravitreal ranibizumab injection and to establish a tomographic classification of mCNV depending on this healing process., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five eyes of 25 patients with mCNV were retrospectively studied. Patients were classified into type A (presence of a hyperreflective coating of the neovascular tissue 1 month after first intravitreal ranibizumab) and type B (absence of or partial coating). Visual acuity (VA) and number of injections were recorded. Differences between both types were assessed at 6 and 12 months of follow-up., RESULTS: Fifteen patients (60%) were classified as type A and 10 as type B (40%). Type A showed better VA than type B. VA improvement was only significant for type A. No differences in the number of injections were observed; however, a trend to a larger amount in type B was observed., CONCLUSIONS: The proposed classification may have prognostic value, with type A mCNV showing better visual outcomes. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2018;49:775-779.]. Copyright 2018, SLACK Incorporated.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to document the distribution of the severity of myopic maculopathy in a cohort of highly myopic patients and to explore the associated risk factors., Methods: A total of 890 Chinese highly myopes aged between 7 and 70 years (median age 19 years) and with spherical refraction -6.00 diopter (D) or worse in both eyes were investigated. All participants underwent detailed ophthalmic examination. Myopic maculopathy was graded into 5 categories according to the International Photographic Classification and Grading System using color fundus photographs: category 0, no myopic retinal lesions, category 1, tessellated fundus only; category 2, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy; category 3, patchy chorioretinal atrophy; category 4, macular atrophy. Category 2 or greater were further classified as clinically significant myopic maculopathy (CSMM)., Results: Data from 884 of 890 right eyes were available for analysis. The proportions of category 1, category 2, category 3, and category 4 were 20.0% (177 eyes), 20.2% (178 eyes), 2.6% (23 eyes), and 0.2% (2 eyes), respectively. The proportion of CSMM increased with more myopic refraction (odds ratio 1.57; 95% confidence interval: 1.46-1.68), longer axial length (odds ratio 2.97; 95% confidence interval: 2.50-3.53), and older age (40-70 years compared to 12-18 years, odds ratio 6.77; 95% confidence interval: 3.61-12.70). However, there was a higher proportion of CSMM in children aged 7 to 11 years than those aged 12 to 18 years (20.9% vs. 11.0%, P = 0.008)., Conclusions: Older age, more myopic refraction, and longer axial length were associated with more severe myopic maculopathy. Although CSMM was uncommon among younger participants, children with early-onset high myopia have a disproportionately increased risk.

N2  - Purpose: Tessellation of the ocular fundus is commonly found at a mild stage in myopic eyes, and their locations vary among individuals. We conducted this study to determine the distribution of tessellation locations in a population study., Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based study. Residents of Kumejima older than 40 years were studied. The subjects filled out a comprehensive questionnaire, had their body height (BH) measured, and had an ocular examination. The location of the tessellation was classified into 6 patterns. Correlations between each pattern and the axial length (AL), age, and BH were statistically determined., Results: Reliable measurements of the AL and fundus photographs of the right eyes were obtained from 1670 subjects. Nine hundred eleven eyes had no tessellation, 113 eyes had tessellation in the posterior pole, 118 eyes had tessellation in the macular area, 383 eyes had tessellation in the peripapillary region, 6 eyes had tessellation in the nasal region, and 239 eyes had tessellation in the inferior region. The AL of the "no tessellation" group was significantly shorter than that of the posterior pole and macular groups (P < 0.01). The individuals of the posterior pole and peripapillary groups were significantly older than in all other groups (P < 0.05) except for the nasal group. The individuals in the inferior tessellation group were significantly taller than those in the no tessellation, posterior pole, and peripapillary groups (P < 0.01)., Conclusions: The location distribution of the tessellation is important in correctly interpreting and predicting myopic changes.

N2  - Purpose: To determine the prevalence, risk factors, and impact of myopic macular degeneration (MMD) on visual impairment and functioning among adults in Singapore., Methods: A comprehensive eye examination, including subjective refraction, axial length, and visual acuity (VA) measurements, was performed in adults aged >=40 years in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) study. From fundus photographs, MMD was graded using the International META-PM classification. Vision-specific functioning (VSF) was assessed with a validated visual-functioning questionnaire (VF-11) using Rasch analysis., Results: A total of 8716 phakic subjects were included in this analysis. The mean age (+/- SD) was 57.2 +/- 9.5 years (33.5% Malays, 33.2% Indians, and 33.3% Chinese). The prevalence of myopia (spherical equivalent [SE] <= -0.5 diopters [D]) and high myopia (SE <= -5.0 D) was 35.7% and 6.0%, respectively. The age-standardized prevalence of MMD was 3.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4-4.3%). The prevalence of MMD was 7.7% among low to moderate myopes, and 28.7% among high myopes. The prevalence of MMD increased nonlinearly with SE and age. MMD was associated with older age, more myopic SE, and lower education. Subjects with Meta-PM categories 3 or 4 in the better-seeing eye had worse best-corrected VA (beta, 0.19; 95%CI, 0.16-0.23) and poorer VSF (beta, -9.7; 95%CI, -17.6 to -1.8) than those without MMD after multivariate adjustments., Conclusions: Approximately 1 in 26 phakic adults in Singapore has MMD. Older age and myopic SE are major risk factors of MMD. Severe MMD has a substantial impact on visual impairment and functioning.

N2  - Purpose: Our previous study reported that 5.5% of probands with early-onset high myopia (eoHM) had mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. Why were the probands initially considered to have eoHM but not Stickler syndrome (STL)?, Methods: Probands and family members with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 were followed up and reexamined based on the criteria for STL. Further comprehensive examinations were conducted for patients with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1. We performed comparisons between probands, affected family members with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, and controls with eoHM without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1., Results: Twelve probands (8.91+/-4.03 years) and 14 affected family members (37.00+/-11.18 years) with eoHM and mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, as well as 30 controls with eoHM but without mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1, were recruited. Among them, 25.0% of probands and 50.0% of affected family members met the diagnostic criteria for STL after reexamination. Posterior vitreous detachment/foveal hypoplasia (PVD/FH), hypermobility of the elbow joint (HJ), and vitreous opacity were more frequent in patients with eoHM with mutations in COL2A1 or COL11A1 than in the controls (p = 1.40 x 10-5, 3.72 x 10-4, 2.30x 10-3, respectively). HJ was more common in the probands than in the affected family members (11/12 versus 3/14; p = 3.42 x 10-4), suggesting age-dependent manifestation. EoHM presented in all the probands and in 11/14 affected family members, suggesting that it is a more common indicator of STL than the previously described vitreoretinal abnormalities, especially in children. The rate of STL diagnosis could increase from 25.0% to 66.7% for probands and from 50.0% to 92.9% for affected family members if eoHM, PVD/FH, and HJ are added to the diagnostic criteria., Conclusions: In summary, it is not easy to differentiate STL from eoHM with routine ocular examination in outpatient clinics. Awareness of atypical phenotypes and newly recognized signs may be of help in identifying atypical STL, especially in children at eye clinics.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term results of a modified technique for parafoveal multiple curvilinear internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling to preserve the epi-foveal ILM in myopic foveoschisis surgery., METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive patients (36 eyes) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the extent of ILM peeled: the fovea-sparing ILM peeling group (FS) (18 eyes) and total ILM peeling group (TP) (18 eyes). Patients were followed up for at least 12 months. The main outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity changes, evolution of macular schisis and the factors associated with the development of a full-thickness macular hole (FTMH)., RESULTS: FTMH developed in 1 of 18 eyes (5.6%) in the FS group and 3 of 18 eyes (16.7%) in the TP group (P = 0.28). Long-term follow-up showed visual improvement was better in the FS group than in the TP group (0.94 vs. 0.58 logMAR). Macular schisis disappeared in 13 of 18 eyes (72.2%) in the FS group, but disappeared in 7 of 18 eyes (38.9%) in the TP group (P = 0.04). Logistic regression analysis showed that only the preoperative outer lamellar macular hole (P = 0.016) was a significant risk factor for development of postoperative FTMH., CONCLUSIONS: Fovea-sparing ILM peeling achieves a higher rate of macular schisis resolution over total peeling. A preoperative outer lamellar macular hole can be a risk factor for the development of a macular hole.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Macular neovascular diseases can cause severe vision loss. A newly approved anti-VEGF drug Conbercept has shown good efficacy and safety in rigorous random controlled trials (RCT), however, it cannot fully reflect the clinical application of Conbercept in real world clinical practice. Moreover, anti-VEGF drugs are expensive and often require multiple treatments, and some patients have poor or even no response to the drugs,this resulted enormous waste of medical resources. Therefore, how to find out those patients who have good response, and how to develop individualized therapeutic regimen in real world need to be urgently investigated in the aspect of pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics., METHODS: This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational study of Conbecept treating macular neovascular diseases in China. Patients suffered from age-related macular degeneration, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, and pathological myopia who already planned to receive Conbercept treatment will be recruited. We aimed to enroll more than 5000 patients from 43 ophthalmic centers in China. Patients' clinical data and blood samples will be collected during the one-year follow-up period. Finally, the safety and efficacy of Conbercept, and the potential predictors of patients' response to Conbercept will be investigated by pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics analysis., DISCUSSION: This study will provide important data of Conbercept in treating macular neovascular diseases in real world. Besides, finding the predictor of patients' response will help doctor make more precise individualized therapeutic regimens., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03128463 .

N2  - Although ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) analysis in the patients with high myopia is useful, there have been few reports to analyze of the reliability for long-term measured GC-IPL thickness. We aimed to analyze the long-term reproducibility of thickness measurements of the GC-IPL using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in patients with high myopia and identify factors that affect such reproducibility. 99 eyes from 99 patients with high myopia without any other ophthalmc disorder such as glaucoma or retinal diseases were included. Two serial SD-OCT (Cirrus-HD) macular scans taken at 1 year intervals were analyzed. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (CV), and test-retest standard deviation (TRTSD) of GC-IPL thickness measurements were assessed. The ICC, CV, and TRTSD of the mean GC-IPL thicknesses were 0.883, 5.9%, and 2.74, respectively. The ICCs of the six-sector GC-IPL thicknesses ranged from 0.740 to 0.904. The CVs of the minimal and all sectoral GC-IPL thicknesses were <10%. Measurement variances for the mean GC-IPL thicknesses showed significant relationshiups with chorioretinal atrophy and posterior staphyloma. There is high long-term reproducibility in GC-IPL thickness measurements using SD-OCT in high-myopia patients. The factors affecting this reproducibility include chorioretinal atrophy and posterior staphyloma.

N2  - PURPOSE: High myopia and pathologic myopia are common causes of visual morbidity. Myopic pathology can affect all regions of the retina, though there is currently no classification system to distinguish anterior (peripheral) and posterior (macular) pathology. We hypothesize that these classifications are characterized by distinct demographic and refractive features, highlighting the disparity in types of pathologic myopia., METHODS: Institutional retrospective cohort study. The Stanford University Medical Center Clinical Data Warehouse was used to identify patients with high myopia by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Predetermined ICD diagnoses were then used to classify patients with high myopia into isolated high myopia (IHM), anterior pathologic myopia (APM), posterior pathologic myopia (PPM), and combined pathologic myopia (CPM). A cohort of this population was then manually reviewed to gather refractive data and confirm accuracy of ICD coding., RESULTS: Patients (3274) were identified with high myopia. Overall, 22.1% individuals met criteria for APM, 10.7% for PPM, 17.0% for CPM, and 50.2% for IHM. We identified a significantly higher frequency of females with PPM compared to APM (62.3 vs. 48.3%; OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.25), Asian patients with PPM as compared to APM (42.9 vs. 33.3%; OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.95), and younger patients with APM compared to PPM (median 45.3 vs. 63.4 years). The refractive error was significantly more myopic in the CPM (median - 9.8D; interquartile range, IQR 6.7) and PPM (median - 10.5D; IQR 9.8) subgroups as compared to the APM (median - 8.1D; IQR 3.5), and IHM (median - 8.2D; IQR 4.1) subgroups (p = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: High myopia may be divided into four distinct subgroups based on presence and location of pathology, which is associated with differences in age, gender, race, and refractive error.

N2  - Purpose: We compare the fluorescein angiography (FA) patterns with morphologic alterations detectable on spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) in myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) and evaluate whether they influence the effects of intravitreal ranibizumab (IVRI) in an as-needed (PRN) regimen., Methods: The 49 patients enrolled in this prospective case series underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), FA, and SD-OCT assessment. The main outcome measure was correlation between FA patterns and SD-OCT features. Secondary outcomes were changes in BCVA and central macular thickness (CMT), and characterization of subretinal hyperreflective exudation (SHE)., Results: Three main patterns were identified on the FA: no (5%), minimal (35%), and profuse (59%) leakage CNV. Comparison between minimal versus profuse leakage CNV subtypes revealed no difference regarding baseline and final BCVA, CNV area, choroidal thickness, final CMT, and proportion of intraretinal cysts, subretinal fluid, and external limiting membrane (ELM) interruption; however, the minimal leakage CNV subgroup revealed a lower percentage of SHE (P = 0.0039), required fewer IVRI (P = 0.003), and showed a baseline smaller CMT (P = 0.004). Patients presenting with SHE showed a similar baseline BCVA to those without exudation, but displayed greater final BCVA improvement. CMT was greater at the baseline and the reduction also was more marked. CNV area achieved a significant reduction only in eyes with SHE. ELM interruption was present in all cases compared to 86.3% of eyes without SHE. Lastly, the eyes with SHE required more injections (P = 0.04)., Conclusions: Different patterns of mCNV may be identified in FA and they correlate with specific SD-OCT alterations. Moreover, the type of FA leakage may assist in identifying more active mCNV.

N2  - Importance: Myopia has reached epidemic levels among children in regions of East and Southeast Asia. High myopia is associated with myopic macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinal detachment., Objective: To determine the incidence of myopia and high myopia based on refraction without cycloplegia among children in primary and junior high schools in China., Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational cohort study was completed in Guangzhou, China. It consisted of a cohort from 19 primary schools, who were followed up from 2010 to 2015, and a cohort from 22 junior high schools, who were followed up from 2010 to 2012. All schools were randomly chosen at rates proportional to the number of schools in each of the city's 11 districts. Students with or without myopia in grade 1 (primary school) or grade 7 (junior high school) were eligible for inclusion. Data analysis occurred from February 2017 to October 2017., Main Outcomes and Measures: Myopia was defined as a spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of -0.50 diopters (D) or less, as measured by subjective refraction without cycloplegia; high myopia was defined as a SER of -6.0 D or less. Annual incidences were defined as the proportion of participants each year found to have myopia or high myopia who did not previously have the condition. Height, weight, axial length (AL), corneal radius of curvature (CRC), and AL/CRC ratio were examined to assess if these measures were associated with future myopia or high myopia., Results: A total of 4741 students with or without myopia in either grade 1 for the primary school cohort (mean [SD] age 7.2 [0.4] years; 932 of 1975 [47.2%] female) or grade 7 for the junior high school cohort (mean [SD] age 13.2 [0.5] years; 1254 of 2670 [47.0%] female) were included. Baseline mean (SD) SER was 0.31 (0.86) D among 1975 students in grade 1 vs -1.60 (2.00) D among 2670 students in grade 7. Baseline prevalence of myopia was 12.0% in grade 1 students (n = 237 of 1969) and 67.4% in grade 7 students (n = 1795 of 2663). The incidence of myopia was 20% to 30% each year throughout both cohorts. The incidence of high myopia was initially less than 1% in the primary school cohort (grade 1: n = 2 of 1825; 0.1% [95% CI, 0.0%-0.3%]), but incidence exceeded 2% in the junior high school cohort (in grade 9: n = 48 of 2044; 2.3% [95% CI, 1.0%-3.7%])., Conclusions and Relevance: The incidence of myopia among Chinese students based on refraction without cycloplegia is among the highest of any cultural or ethnic group. If confirmed with cycloplegic refraction, interventions to prevent myopia onset in Chinese populations should be initiated in primary schools.

N2  - Importance: Retinal structures may serve as a biomarker for dementia, but longitudinal studies examining this link are lacking., Objective: To investigate the association of inner retinal layer thickness with prevalent and incident dementia in a general population of Dutch adults., Design, Setting, and Participants: From September 2007 to June 2012, participants from the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study who were 45 years and older and had gradable retinal optical coherence tomography images and at baseline were free from stroke, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinopathy, myopia, hyperopia, and optic disc pathology were included. They were followed up until January 1, 2015, for the onset of dementia., Exposures: Inner retinal layer thicknesses (ie, retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL]) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thicknesses measured on optical coherence tomography images., Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds ratios and hazard ratios for incident dementia per SD decrease in retinal layer thickness adjusted for age, sex, education, and cardiovascular risk factors., Results: Of 5065 individuals eligible for optical coherence tomography scanning, 3289 (64.9%) (mean [SD] age 68.9 [9.9] years, 1879 [57%] women) were included in the analysis. Of these 3289 individuals, 41 (1.2%) already had dementia. Thinner GC-IPL was associated with prevalent dementia (odds ratio per SD decrease in GC-IPL, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.99-1.90]). No association was found of RNFL with prevalent dementia. During 14674 person-years of follow-up (mean [SD], 4.5 [1.6] years), 86 individuals (2.6%) developed dementia of whom 68 (2.1%) had Alzheimer disease. Thinner RNFL at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing dementia (hazard ratio per SD decrease in RNFL, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.19-1.75]), which was similar for Alzheimer disease (hazard ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.15-1.78]). No association was found between GC-IPL thickness and incident dementia (hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.90-1.43])., Conclusions and Relevance: Thinner RNFL is associated with an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer disease, suggesting that retinal neurodegeneration may serve as a preclinical biomarker for dementia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate inner retinal dimples after peeling of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) for macular holes (lamellar macular hole [LMH] and full-thickness macular hole [FTMH]) via multiple imaging modes of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to assess their relationship with preoperative vitreoretinal interface conditions., METHODS: The data of 38 eyes in 35 patients who underwent surgery for LMH, and FTMH were retrospectively studied. The presence of postoperative inner retinal dimples was judged by a combination of en face OCT layer images and cross-sectional images. The demographic and clinical characteristics of eyes with and without inner retinal defects were compared to identify factors involved in the formation of the defects., RESULTS: Inner retinal defects were found in 26 eyes (68%) after surgery. They appeared on the en face OCT ILM layer images as multiple dark spots limited to the ILM peeling area, and corresponded to dimples or pitting of inner retinal layers on cross-sectional OCT images. In 5 cases (19%), apparent progression of inner retinal defects was observed on the en face OCT images as increasing numbers and sizes of the dark spots, which seemed to follow an eccentric growth pattern starting from the central macula. In addition, highly myopic eyes were found to be associated with the formation of more severe inner retinal defects., CONCLUSIONS: Multiple imaging modes of en face spectral-domain OCT provide comprehensive information about the appearance of inner retinal dimples. High myopic eyes seem to develop more severe inner retinal defects after ILM peeling.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the proportions of eyes with indiscernible Bruch's membrane opening (BMO) in glaucoma patients and healthy individuals with and without high myopia and to investigate factors contributing to indiscernible BMO., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred eyes from 315 participants, including 212 high myopic eyes (axial length [AL], >=26 mm) from 80 glaucoma patients and 60 healthy individuals and 288 non-high myopic eyes (AL, <26 mm) from 96 glaucoma patients and 88 healthy individuals., METHODS: The optic disc was imaged by the Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) using 24 equally spaced radial B-scans. The BMO was located independently by 2 trained observers and was recorded as discernible or indiscernible over 48 meridians in each eye. The BMO of a meridian was determined to be indiscernible when both observers failed to identify its location. The agreement between the observers was evaluated with kappa statistics. Factors associated with indiscernible BMO were identified with multivariable, multilevel logistic regression modeling., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of eyes with indiscernible BMO and hazard ratios (HRs) of factors associated with indiscernible BMO., RESULTS: The agreement for assessment of BMO visibility between the observers was good (kappa, 0.631; 95% confidence interval, 0.602-0.661). In the groups with and without high myopia, 32.1% and 8.2% of glaucomatous eyes had 1 or more meridians with indiscernible BMO, respectively. In the healthy eyes, the respective proportions were 28.0% and 3.9%. The proportions were significantly higher in eyes with high myopia compared to eyes without high myopia in the glaucoma group (P < 0.001) and the healthy group (P < 0.001). The temporal meridian, followed by the inferotemporal and superotemporal meridians, of the optic disc were the most frequent locations with indiscernible BMO. Increased AL, advanced glaucoma, beta parapapillary atrophy, and young age were associated with an increased HR of indiscernible BMO (P <= 0.032)., CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of high myopic eyes have indiscernible BMO at the temporal, superotemporal, and inferotemporal meridians of the optic disc, which may compromise the measurement of neuroretinal rim in the diagnostic evaluation of glaucoma.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis was made to measure risk factors for retinal redetachment (re-RD) after silicone oil removal (SOR) in a quantitative method., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature review relating to risk factors for re-RD after SOR was conducted before March 2017. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated after data combination., RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included, and risk factors with significant differences found between the re-RD and control groups are as follows: aphakic eye (OR = 1.50), high myopia (OR = 2.47), previous failed retinal surgery (OR = 1.71), and ocular trauma (OR = 3.52). Peripheral 360degree laser retinopexy (OR = 0.40) and scleral encircling band (OR = 0.58) were found to be protective factors of re-RD after SOR., CONCLUSION: Aphakic eye, high myopia, previous failed retinal surgery, ocular trauma, lack of 360degree laser, and scleral encircling band were possible risk factors relating to the occurrence of re-RD after SOR.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the natural disease progression of high myopia in Caucasians considered at risk for the development of myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV)., METHODS: Subjects were recruited in 25 clinical sites between June 2014 and June 2016. Main inclusion criteria included axial length of >=26 mm, best-corrected visual acuity >=0.05 decimal equivalent and presence of at least one out of five predefined morphological disease risk criteria. These were (1) subfoveal choroidal thinning < 50 microm, (2) enhanced choroidal curvature length > 6,300 microm, (3) lacquer cracks, (4) patchy atrophy > 5 mm2 and (5) preexisting mCNV in the fellow eye (German Clinical Trial Register DRKS00007761)., RESULTS: A total of 150 participants (66% females) with a mean age of 57.2 (+/-12.7) years (range 21.9-86.2 years) were included. The disease criteria most frequently encountered were choroidal thinning (33.3%) and lacquer cracks (32.7%). Enhanced choroidal curvature length was detected in only 8 subjects and always occurred in combination with other disease criteria. Presence of patchy atrophy was found to be more common in older subjects (p = 0.0012) and also associated with a more severe disease manifestation., CONCLUSION: The baseline data of this study indicate that enhanced choroidal curvature might be less common in Caucasians than in Asian populations. Further, disease severity in patients with high myopia is relatively high in the presence of patchy atrophy. Copyright © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - PURPOSE: A ranibizumab prefilled syringe (PFS) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Here we evaluate the use of the ranibizumab PFS for intravitreal injection by assessing whether the PFS enables healthcare providers to successfully prepare and administer an injection without prior training., DESIGN: Simulated-use and actual-use human factors usability studies., PARTICIPANTS: Retina specialists and ophthalmic medical personnel., METHODS: In a simulated-use summative usability study, retina specialists (n = 15) and ophthalmic medical personnel (n = 15) prepared the ranibizumab PFS and performed injections into a model eye. In an actual-use formative usability study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02698566), three assistants and three retina specialists prepared the PFS and performed intravitreal injections, respectively, in study eyes of patients with retinal diseases (n = 35)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twelve tasks specific to the unpacking, preparing, and properly administering the PFS for intravitreal injection were evaluated by a study assessor. Task performances were evaluated for use errors, close calls, and operational difficulties. Post-injection subjective user evaluations were performed to assess ease of use., RESULTS: All participants successfully performed all essential and safety-critical tasks without use error in both the simulated-use and actual-use human factors usability studies. The majority of participants rated the tasks required to use the ranibizumab PFS as "Easy" or "Very Easy.", CONCLUSIONS: Both the simulated-use and actual-use usability studies yielded consistent data, showing that healthcare professionals are able to use the ranibizumab PFS by successfully performing all critical tasks involved in preparing and delivering an intravitreal injection. The simulated-use usability testing was sufficiently realistic and representative of real-world use, and was appropriate and preferred over actual-use usability testing for proper evaluation of the product user interface. LAY ABSTRACT: Ranibizumab is approved in the United States to treat various eye conditions, including neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, and myopic choroidal neovascularization. It is administered as an injection into the eye once a month, and is available in a vial from which medication needs to be withdrawn using a standard syringe with a 19-gauge filter needle. The filter needle is then replaced by a smaller gauge needle for the intravitreal injection. The recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a 0.5 mg ranibizumab prefilled syringe eliminates the need for withdrawing medication from a vial and changing needles prior to use. The studies described in this report assessed the usability of the ranibizumab prefilled syringe by retina specialists and ophthalmic medical personnel in simulated- and actual-use settings. Twelve tasks that included unpacking, preparing, and properly administering the prefilled syringe for intravitreal injection were evaluated by a study assessor. Task performances were evaluated for use errors, close calls, and operational difficulties. Participants successfully performed all the tasks without any critical errors in both simulated-use and actual-use human factors usability studies, and most participants found the syringe to be "Easy" or "Very Easy" to use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) in highly myopic eyes was found to be correlated with increasing age, refractive error (spherical equivalent), and axial length. Which factor is the most significant predictor of SFCT remains controversial., METHODS: A hospital-based cohort of highly myopic eyes (with spherical equivalent equal to or over 6.00 diopter) were retrospectively screened. Data from only right eye in those bilateral high myopia, and unilateral high myopia in any eye, were used for analysis. Correlations among the four biometric factors were analyzed. Linear correlation was performed to analyze the predictors of SFCT., RESULTS: A cohort of 312 eyes from 312 adults (98 men) was enrolled. Statistical analysis showed that axial length (R = - 0.592), spherical equivalent (R = - 0.471), and age (R = - 0.296) were significantly correlated with SFCT (P < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between age and axial length, or age and spherical equivalent. Partial correlation with controlled age confirmed that axial length (R = - 0.628) was a more significant predictor of SFCT than spherical equivalent (R = - 0.507)., CONCLUSIONS: SFCT was inversely correlated with increasing age, spherical equivalent and axial length, with axial length as the most significant predictor of SFCT, in adult highly myopic eyes.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate risk factors for high myopia in the general Korean population., METHODS: In this nationwide population study, the dataset of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008-2012 was analyzed. The study cohort included 11 703 participants, aged 25-49 years, who underwent neither refractive nor cataract surgery. The association between demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and systemic variables and high myopia was investigated., RESULTS: The mean participant age was 37.9 +/- 6.8 years, and the prevalence of high myopia <=-6.0D was 7.0 +/- 0.3% in the study population. The right eyes (-1.76 +/- 0.03 D) were more myopic than the left eyes (-1.70 +/- 0.03 D; P < 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, high myopia was associated with age (odds ratio [OR], 0.97 per 1 year-increase) and female sex (OR, 1.24). Other identified risk factors included education level >= university graduation (OR, 1.91), the presence of hypertension (OR, 1.69), and serum glucose level (OR, 1.01 per 1 mg/dL). Sunlight exposure of >=5 h/day (OR, 0.67) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (OR, 0.97 per 1 ng/mL) showed protective effect against high myopia., CONCLUSION: High myopia is associated with younger age, female sex, high education level, longer sunlight exposure, and some other systemic conditions.

N2  - PURPOSE: We used systematic review and meta-analysis to identify and assimilate evidence quantifying blindness and visual impairment (VI) associated with myopic macular degeneration (MMD), then derived models to predict global patterns. The models were used to estimate the global prevalence of blindness and VI associated with MMD from 2000 to 2050., METHODS: The systematic review identified 17 papers with prevalence data for MMD VI fitting our inclusion criteria. Data from six papers with age-specific data were scaled to relative age-dependent risk and meta-analysed at VI and blindness levels. We analysed variance in all MMD VI and blindness data as a proportion of high myopia against variables from the place and year of data collection, with a model based on health expenditure providing the best correlation. We used this model to estimate the prevalence and number of people with MMD VI in each country in each decade., RESULTS: We included data from 17 studies comprising 137 514 participants. We estimated 10.0 million people had VI from MMD in 2015 (prevalence 0.13%, 95% CI 5.5 to 23.7 million, 0.07% to 0.34%), 3.3 million of whom were blind (0.04%, 1.8 to 7.8 million, 0.03% to 0.10%). We estimate that by 2050, without changing current interventions, VI from MMD will grow to 55.7 million people (0.57%, 29.0 to 119.7 million, 0.33% to 1.11%), 18.5 million of whom will be blind (0.19%, 9.6 to 39.7 million, 0.11% to 0.37%)., CONCLUSION: The burden of MMD blindness and VI will rise significantly without efforts to reduce the development and progression of myopia and improve the management of MMD.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the cumulative five-year incidence and progression of myopic maculopathy in a rural Chinese adult population., METHODS: The Handan Eye Study was a population-based longitudinal study. In 2006, 6830 subjects aged 30+ years participated in this study (baseline). Five years later, 5394 subjects (follow-up rate: 85.3%) took part in the follow-up study. Participants had a detailed eye examination, including visual acuity, standardized refraction and fundus photography according to a similar protocol at both baseline and follow-up. Myopic maculopathy was defined as any of the following signs: diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, patchy chorioretinal atrophy, macular atrophy, lacquer cracks and myopic choroidal neovascularization at the posterior pole. Parapapillary atrophy was assessed separately., RESULTS: Of 5394 participants, 5078 (10 021 eyes) had gradable fundus photographs. Over the five years, four participants (five eyes) developed new myopic maculopathy, with an eye-specific incidence of 0.05% (95% CI, 0.02-0.10%). Among the 51 eyes with myopic maculopathy at baseline, the progression occurred in 18 eyes (35.3%), with new signs of patchy chorioretinal atrophy in 11 eyes (21.6%), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy in seven eyes (13.7%), lacquer cracks in three eyes (6.9%), macular atrophy in three eyes (6.9%) and myopic choroidal neovascularization in two eyes (3.9%). By multivariable analysis, female gender (OR, 9.14; p = 0.004) and higher educational level (OR, 8.24; p = 0.004) were associated with a higher risk of progression of myopic maculopathy, whereas lower myopia at baseline (OR, 0.79; p < 0.0001) and hypertension (OR, 0.21; p = 0.017) were associated with a reduced risk., CONCLUSIONS: The five-year incidence of myopic maculopathy was 0.05% in rural Chinese adults aged 30+ years. The progression rate in participants with myopic maculopathy was 35.3%, indicating the importance of regular follow-up for these patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of interventions for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to etiologies other than age-related macular degeneration and pathologic myopia., METHODS: Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and CENTRAL., RESULTS: The search identified 5 RCTs; no relevant observational studies were identified. The studies differed in terms of underlying cause of CNV, patient numbers (n = 9-178), follow-up time (2-36 months) and quality assessment. In the largest RCT (n = 178 across a range of rare CNV etiologies), intravitreal ranibizumab showed superior efficacy versus sham from baseline to month 2 [mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA): + 9.5 vs. - 0.4 letters; p < 0.001]; the gain was maintained up to month 12. In the treatment of CNV secondary to presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS), both intravitreal ranibizumab and photodynamic therapy (PDT) showed significant improvement from baseline BCVA over the 12-month period (n = 9); however, all patients in the PDT group required rescue ranibizumab therapy. Unlicensed intravitreal bevacizumab was associated with a statistically significant improvement in BCVA compared to PDT at 12 months (p < 0.001) in patients with CNV secondary to multifocal choroiditis (n = 27). The use of steroids before PDT showed better BCVA outcomes than PDT alone (p < 0.05) in patients with idiopathic CNV (n = 20). Argon green laser therapy showed limited efficacy in patients with CNV secondary to OHS (n = 134)., CONCLUSION: There is evidence from a relatively large, good-quality study to support the use of intravitreal ranibizumab for the treatment of CNV secondary to rare diseases. However, the limited number of RCTs for this indication and differences in study characteristics between RCTs mean that there is uncertainty regarding comparative clinical effectiveness of interventions. RCTs with an active comparator are required to fully establish the comparative effectiveness of treatments for CNV secondary to rare diseases., FUNDING: Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Surrey, UK.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the progression pattern of myopic maculopathy and associated factors in a population-based study., DESIGN: Population-based longitudinal study., PARTICIPANTS: The Beijing Eye Study including 4439 participants in 2001 was repeated in 2011, with 2695 individuals (66.4%) being re-examined in 2011., METHODS: The study participants underwent detailed ophthalmic and general examinations. Using fundus photographs obtained in 2001 and 2011, we assessed the progression of myopic maculopathy in highly myopic eyes with a refractive error >=-6 diopters in 2001. Myopic maculopathy was differentiated into tessellated fundus (category 1), diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (category 2), patchy chorioretinal atrophy (category 3), and macular atrophy (category 4), with lacquer cracks and choroidal neovascularization as additional plus signs., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Progression pattern of myopic maculopathy., RESULTS: Of 110 highly myopic eyes (70 individuals) at baseline, 39 eyes (35.5%) showed progression observed in 15 of 79 eyes (19%) with tessellated fundus at baseline, in 17 of 24 eyes (71%) with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, in all 6 eyes with patchy chorioretinal atrophy, and the 1 eye with macular atrophy. Lacquer cracks detected in 2 eyes in 2001 developed into a small patchy atrophy (1 eye) or widened during the follow-up (1 eye). Five eyes demonstrated new lacquer cracks. In binary regression analysis, progression of myopic maculopathy was associated with longer axial length (P < 0.001; odds ratio [OR], 7.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.49-20.4), older age (P = 0.001; OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.42), higher prevalence of staphylomas (P = 0.03; OR, 24.3; 95% CI, 2.89-204), smaller parapapillary gamma-zone in 2011 (P = 0.01; OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91), and female gender (P = 0.04; OR, 9.78; 95% CI, 1.06-90.6)., CONCLUSIONS: The 10-year progression rate of myopic maculopathy in this elderly Chinese population was 35.5%, increasing from 15 of 79 eyes (19%) in category 1 of myopic maculopathy at baseline to 17 of 24 eyes (71%) in category 2 and 6 of 6 eyes (100%) in category 3. Risk factors for myopic maculopathy progression were longer axial length, pre-existing staphylomata, smaller parapapillary gamma-zone, older age, and female gender.

N2  - SIGNIFICANCE: Some studies reported that optic disc tilt and rotation might be risk factors for the susceptibility of high myopic eyes to develop glaucoma. However, data regarding optic disc manifestations in high myopia participants are few. It is crucial to characterize the features of optic disc manifestations among high myopes., PURPOSE: To describe optic disc characteristics of Chinese highly myopic eyes and to investigate associated factors., METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study included 890 Chinese with bilateral high myopia (defined as <=-6.00 diopters spherical power) in 2012. All subjects underwent cycloplegic autorefraction, ocular biometry, and fundus photography. The optic disc tilt ratio, degree of rotation, and beta-zone peripapillary atrophy area were measured from the 45degreeoptic disc-centered fundus photographs. Optic disc tilt was defined as optic disc tilt ratio, the ratio of maximum to minimum diameter of optic disc, exceeding 1.3. The definition of optic disc rotation was using optic disc rotation degree, the angle from long diameter and the vertical meridian, of >15degree., RESULTS: Among 890 participants, 2 were excluded by ungradable optic disc-centered fundus photographs. In the 888 studied right eyes, the mean spherical power was -9.36 +/- 3.46 diopters with a mean axial length of 27.51 +/- 1.63 mm. The proportion of optic disc tilting, rotation, and beta-zone peripapillary atrophy were 81.2%, 48.3%, and 92.8%, respectively. The mean ratio of optic disc tilting and rotation degree was 1.78 +/- 0.53 and 21.08 +/- 19.91degree; the mean area of beta-zone peripapillary atrophy/optic disc head was 1.11 +/- 1.22. A multiple linear regression showed that older age (P < .001), female (P = .02), and more myopic spherical equivalent (P = .005) were related to the greater optic disc tilting ratio., CONCLUSIONS: Beta-zone peripapillary atrophy, optic disc tilting, and rotation are very common in highly myopic eyes in Chinese population. Older age, female, and more myopic spherical equivalent are risk factors of higher degree of optic disc tilting.

N2  - AIMS: Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents effectively treat age-related macular degeneration and myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a fibrinolytic compound, is used as an adjuvant to displace submacular hemorrhage and to treat type 2 CNV. The purpose of this study was to investigate in in vitro and in vivo experiments the antiangiogenic impact of tPA itself., METHODS: The impact of tPA on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was assessed by an XTT assay [2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide]. A basic fibroblast growth factor-impregnated gelatin hydrogel sheet was implanted into the rabbit cornea to induce corneal neovascularization. Immediately postoperatively, tPA or buffered saline solution (control) was injected intravitreally., RESULTS: The growth and viability of the HUVECs were unaffected by tPA at clinical concentrations. In the control group, the mean lengths of the new vessels were 1.0 +/- 0.41, 1.6 +/- 0.75, and 3.6 +/- 2.1 mm at weeks 1, 2, and 4, respectively. In contrast, tPA significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the corneal neovascularization., CONCLUSION: Although tPA has no direct impact on the vascular endothelial cells in vitro, the fibrinolytic effects of tPA might markedly suppress neovascularization in vivo.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the performance of a deep learning algorithm for detecting referable glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) based on color fundus photographs., DESIGN: A deep learning system for the classification of GON was developed for automated classification of GON on color fundus photographs., PARTICIPANTS: We retrospectively included 48 116 fundus photographs for the development and validation of a deep learning algorithm., METHODS: This study recruited 21 trained ophthalmologists to classify the photographs. Referable GON was defined as vertical cup-to-disc ratio of 0.7 or more and other typical changes of GON. The reference standard was made until 3 graders achieved agreement. A separate validation dataset of 8000 fully gradable fundus photographs was used to assess the performance of this algorithm., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) with sensitivity and specificity was applied to evaluate the efficacy of the deep learning algorithm detecting referable GON., RESULTS: In the validation dataset, this deep learning system achieved an AUC of 0.986 with sensitivity of 95.6% and specificity of 92.0%. The most common reasons for false-negative grading (n = 87) were GON with coexisting eye conditions (n = 44 [50.6%]), including pathologic or high myopia (n = 37 [42.6%]), diabetic retinopathy (n = 4 [4.6%]), and age-related macular degeneration (n = 3 [3.4%]). The leading reason for false-positive results (n = 480) was having other eye conditions (n = 458 [95.4%]), mainly including physiologic cupping (n = 267 [55.6%]). Misclassification as false-positive results amidst a normal-appearing fundus occurred in only 22 eyes (4.6%)., CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning system can detect referable GON with high sensitivity and specificity. Coexistence of high or pathologic myopia is the most common cause resulting in false-negative results. Physiologic cupping and pathologic myopia were the most common reasons for false-positive results. Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term endothelial tolerance of iris-fixated phakic intraocular lenses (pIOLs) over a 10-year period, to identify predictive factors for endothelial decompensation, and to develop a model to predict endothelial cell survival after pIOL implantation., METHODS: This retrospective study included 130 eyes in 60 patients who underwent pIOL implantation for correction of high myopia from January 2003 to October 2012 at Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon, France. Endothelial cell densities (ECDs) were measured using specular microscopy before and biannually after pIOL implantation. Best-corrected visual acuity was measured before and 6 months after pIOL implantation. The annual postoperative decrease in ECD was estimated using a mixed linear regression model with a random intercept. Patient and eye characteristics were introduced into the model to quantify their effect on ECD change. The main outcome measures were annual postoperative reduction of ECD and best-corrected visual acuity., RESULTS: The preoperative ECD was 2770 +/- 265 cells/mm (2134-3200 cells/mm). The ECD decreased by 1.83%, on average (95% confidence interval, 1.54-2.10), during the first postoperative year. Thereafter, the mean decrease in annual ECD was estimated to be 0.87% (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.95). For a cell number of 3500, 3000, 2500, and 2000, the number of years required to reach the threshold of 1500 cells/mm was estimated to be approximately 96, 78, 57, and 32 years, respectively. No predictive factors for endothelial decompensation were identified., CONCLUSIONS: pIOL implantation is a safe surgical means to correct high myopia in phakic patients without compromising corneal endothelium survival.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine the progression pattern of myopic maculopathy., DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series., PARTICIPANTS: Highly myopic patients who had been followed up for 10 years or more., METHODS: Using fundus photographs, myopic features were differentiated according to Meta-analysis of Pathologic Myopia (META-PM) Study Group recommendations., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Progression pattern of maculopathy., RESULTS: The study included 810 eyes of 432 patients (mean age, 42.3+/-16.8 years; mean axial length, 28.8+/-1.9 mm; mean follow-up, 18.7+/-7.1 years). The progression rate of myopic maculopathy was 47.0 per 1000 eye-years. Within the pathologic myopia (PM) group (n = 521 eyes), progression of myopic maculopathy was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.21; P = 0.001), older age (OR, 1.03; P = 0.002), longer axial length (OR, 1.20; P = 0.007), greater axial elongation (OR, 1.45; P = 0.005), and development of parapapillary atrophy (PPA; OR, 3.14; P < 0.001). Diffuse atrophy, found in 217 eyes without choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or lacquer cracks (LCs) at baseline, progressed in 111 (51%) eyes, leading to macular diffuse atrophy (n = 64; 64/111 or 58%), patchy atrophy (n = 59; 53%), myopic CNV (n = 18; 16%), LCs (n = 9; 5%), and patchy-related macular atrophy (n = 3; 3%). Patchy atrophy, detected in 63 eyes without CNV or LCs at baseline, showed progression in 60 eyes (95%), leading to enlargement of original patchy atrophy (n = 59; 59/60 or 98%), new patchy atrophy (n = 29; 48%), CNV-related macular atrophy (n = 13; 22%), and patchy-related macular atrophy (n = 5; 8%). Of 66 eyes with LCs, 43 eyes (65%) showed progression with development of new patchy atrophy (n = 38; 38/43 or 88%) and new LCs (n = 7; 16%). Reduction in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was associated mainly (all P < 0.001) with the development of CNV or CNV-related macular atrophy and enlargement of macular atrophy., CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent progression patterns were an extension of peripapillary diffuse atrophy to macular diffuse atrophy in diffuse atrophy, enlargement of the original atrophic lesion in patchy atrophy, and development of patchy atrophy in LCs. Main risk factors for progression were older age, longer axial length, and development of PPA. Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A population-based Copenhagen birth year 1948 cohort with high myopia recorded since age 14 years (spherical equivalent less than or equivalent to -6 D) has been followed over 50 years. Despite complications, current follow-ups have outlined a better visual prognosis than usually drawn from selected clinical series in the literature. For the present status at age 66 years, focus was on visual ability and choroidal thickness., METHODS: Twenty-eight of the original 39 participants were available in 2014. Medical history was updated. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) data were compared with subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), now measured by enhanced depth optical coherence tomography., RESULTS: Due to at least better eye visual acuity (VA), all patients had maintained their everyday visual capacity. Only one participant was marginal regarding visual status for a driver's licence; low vision was not on record. Based on all eyes, choroidal thickness correlated negatively with axial length (AL), which also held for the fraction with high myopia (AL >26.5 mm). In high myopia, the mean choroidal subfoveal thickness was 114 +/- 75 mum versus 182 +/- 94 mum in lower myopia (p = 0.01)., CONCLUSION: Despite the generally maintained individual visual capacity in the series, significant correlation could be demonstrated between SFCT and (i) axial elongation and (ii) recorded VA, with a negative and a positive sign, respectively. Overall, the visual prognosis was relatively benign, in particular when compared with the selected high myopia hospital series that predominate in the ophthalmic literature.

N2  - PURPOSE: To characterize and provide population-based prevalence estimates of myopic degeneration (MD) among Chinese Americans, the fastest-growing minority population in the United States in the last decade., DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study., METHODS: A total of 1523 Chinese-American adults with myopia, aged 50 years and older, residing in the city of Monterey Park, California, underwent an interview and comprehensive eye examination, including subjective and objective refraction and stereoscopic fundus photography. For each participant, the eye with the worse myopic refractive error was included in this analysis. MD was assessed in a masked manner by an expert grader., RESULTS: The prevalence of any MD was 44.9% among myopic subjects, based on the presence of any degenerative lesion secondary to myopia. The prevalence was 32.2% when MD was defined by a modified version of the Meta-Analysis for Pathologic Myopia. The prevalence of specific lesions included tessellation (31.7%), tilted disc (28.1%), peripapillary atrophy (7.0%), staphyloma (5.7%), diffuse atrophy (6.4%), lacquer cracks (2.6%), intrachoroidal cavitation (2.2%), patchy atrophy (0.9%), and end-stage MD (0.2%). The prevalence of MD was higher among older myopic subjects and among participants with more severe myopia and longer axial length (P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first population-based estimates of MD in Chinese Americans and indicate that a high proportion of Chinese Americans might be at risk for MD and associated visual complications. Prevalence of MD in this cohort of Chinese Americans was higher than that observed in other East Asian populations and in people of other ethnicities. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the retinal features and distribution of paravascular abnormalities (PVAs) and their relationship with retinoschisis in eyes with high myopia., METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two eyes of 88 patients with high myopia [refractive error greater than -6 dioptres (D) or axial length (AL) >=26.5 mm] who had undergone comprehensive ophthalmic examinations were evaluated in this cross-sectional study. Multiple optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were performed to study the microstructural alterations adjacent to the retinal vascular arcades and the entire macular area. The presence and distribution patterns of various PVAs, retinoschisis and the association between these parameters were analysed., RESULTS: Of the 152 highly myopic eyes, PVAs were detected by OCT in 126 eyes (82.9%), including paravascular microfolds in all 126 eyes, paravascular cysts in 109 eyes (71.7%) and paravascular lamellar holes in 44 eyes (28.9%). All three types of PVAs were observed more frequently along the temporal vascular arcades than along the nasal vascular arcades (p < 0.005). Seventy-eight eyes (51.3%) were identified with retinoschisis at retinal vascular arcades, most frequently in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and along temporal arcades. Eyes with all three types of PVAs (microfolds, cysts and lamellar holes) had the highest incidence of retinoschisis at vascular arcades (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that age, the AL, presence of paravascular microfolds and cysts, and simultaneously existence of all three types of PVAs were associated with an increased risk for retinoschisis at vascular arcades. Macular retinoschisis was detected in 25 eyes (19.8%) and presented with splitting of the outer retina in all cases. All seven eyes with entire macular area retinoschisis (S4 grade) were accompanied by retinoschisis at vascular arcades within multiple layers, including outer retinoschisis, IPL schisis and inner limiting membrane (ILM) detachment., CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that all three types of PVAs and different types of retinoschisis were most frequently observed along the temporal vascular arcades. Eyes with paravascular microfolds and cysts, and those with all three paravascular lesions may in risk of developing retinoschisis at vascular arcades.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess predictive factors and surgical outcomes for myopic traction maculopathy., METHODS: This retrospective observational case study enrolled 73 patients who underwent vitrectomy for myopic traction maculopathy. The 79 eyes obtained from our study sample were divided into 4 types: retinoschisis, lamellar macular hole (lamellar MH), foveal retinal detachment (FRD), and FRD + lamellar MH, or into 2 types according to the presence of FRD preoperatively. Dependent variables of interest were age, sex, pre- and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 6 months, and axial length., RESULTS: All the four types showed moderately strong-to-strong positive correlations with pre- and postoperative BCVA (retinochisisi: r = 0.61; lamellar MH: r = 0.62; FRD: r = 0.51; FRD + lamellar MH; r = 0.83). Preoperative BCVA was associated with postoperative BCVA (P < 0.0001), but age, axial length, and the types of preoperative foveal status were not. Eyes with FRD had significantly worse pre- and postoperative BCVA than eyes without FRD (P = 0.036 and P = 0.046, respectively). Postoperative full-thickness macular holes developed in 5.1% of cases and in all types but retinoschisis., CONCLUSION: Preoperative visual acuity and the presence of FRD should be considered for surgical indication of myopic traction maculopathy.

N2  - Pathologic myopia is a leading cause of visual impairment. Development of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is one of the most common complications that leads to central vision loss in patients with pathologic myopia. If left untreated, it can cause scarring with expanding macular atrophy leading to irreversible visual loss in a period as short as 5 years. Advancements in multimodal imaging technology have furthered our understanding of the condition; however, further studies are necessary to extend its utility in the diagnosis of myopic CNV. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy has become the standard-of-care and the recommended first-line treatment option for myopic CNV. Long-term studies have demonstrated that early treatment of confirmed myopic CNV cases with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent is useful to avoid late-stage complications. This strategy has also been shown to achieve visual outcome improvements for up to 4 years and visual stabilization up to 6 years. This review article provides an overview of the current knowledge on myopic CNV and discusses recent updates in the diagnosis and management of the condition. Furthermore, treatment recommendations are provided based on the authors' expert opinions. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the ultrastructure of the internal limiting membranes (ILMs) excised during vitrectomy from highly myopic eyes with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM). The clinical findings before and after the vitrectomy were compared., METHODS: Seven eyes of 7 patients with macular retinoschisis were studied. Four of these eyes also had a foveal detachment but without a retinal break. All the eyes underwent vitrectomy with the creation of a posterior vitreous detachment and ILM peeling. The excised ILMs were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)., RESULTS: The retinas were reattached in all eyes after the vitrectomy. No retinal breaks including macular holes were identified intraoperatively. Transmission electron microscopy showed glial cells in 4 eyes, retinal pigment epithelium-like cells in 4 eyes, and myofibroblast-like cells in 4 eyes on the excised ILMs. A newly produced basement membrane appeared to merge with the ILM in 5 eyes. Thick collagen was seen in 2 eyes, and fibrous long-spacing collagen in the newly synthesized collagen fibers was seen in 3 eyes. The cellular components of the glial cells appeared to have migrated through the thinner parts of the retina or through a defect of the ILM in 2 eyes., CONCLUSIONS: Cells that migrate onto the surface of the ILM synthesize new collagen, which can create tangential traction. This may explain the success of vitrectomy with ILM peeling in treating MTM in highly myopic eyes.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate changes in the anterior segment of myopic eyes and assess anterior biometry as a function of axial length (AL)., DESIGN: Retrospective investigational study., PARTICIPANTS: Patients evaluated for phakic intraocular lens surgery at a tertiary eye care centre., METHODS: Patients with corrected visual acuity > 20/40 and AL > 24.5 mm were included in the study. Posterior staphyloma and maculopathy were ruled out in all the patients, and 176 eyes were included for analysis. AL was measured with partial coherence interferometry, while keratometry, central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and horizontal white to white (WTW) were measured with slit-scanning topography. Group 1 included 55 eyes with AL < 26.5 mm, group 2 had 57 eyes with AL between 26.5 and 28.5 mm while group 3 had 64 eyes with AL > 28.5 mm., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correlation of AL with anterior biometry., RESULTS: The mean AL of the study eyes was 27.88 + 2.14 mm. The mean values of ACD (2.99 mm), CCT (0.52 mm), WTW (11.68 mm), and keratometry (43.62 D) were within the normal range. Overall, very weak correlations could be established between AL and CCT (R = 0.17, p = 0.02), AL and keratometry (R = - 0.28, p < 0.001), and AL and WTW (R = 0.22, p = 0.002), while ACD did not relate to AL significantly. The ACD and CCT did not relate significantly to AL in any of the three groups. Keratometry had a weak negative relation with AL in groups 1 and 2, while WTW had a weakly positive relation with AL in group 2 only. No variable had any significant relation with AL in group 3., CONCLUSION: There is disproportionate elongation of the eyeball in myopic patients with very weak or no correlation between anterior biometry and AL. This discord is more in longer eyes. Such a scenario can be challenging to a refractive surgeon treating highly myopic eyes and needs further evaluation.

N2  - There is an epidemic of myopia in East and Southeast Asia, with the prevalence of myopia in young adults around 80-90%, and an accompanying high prevalence of high myopia in young adults (10-20%). This may foreshadow an increase in low vision and blindness due to pathological myopia. These two epidemics are linked, since the increasingly early onset of myopia, combined with high progression rates, naturally generates an epidemic of high myopia, with high prevalences of "acquired" high myopia appearing around the age of 11-13. The major risk factors identified are intensive education, and limited time outdoors. The localization of the epidemic appears to be due to the high educational pressures and limited time outdoors in the region, rather than to genetically elevated sensitivity to these factors. Causality has been demonstrated in the case of time outdoors through randomized clinical trials in which increased time outdoors in schools has prevented the onset of myopia. In the case of educational pressures, evidence of causality comes from the high prevalence of myopia and high myopia in Jewish boys attending Orthodox schools in Israel compared to their sisters attending religious schools, and boys and girls attending secular schools. Combining increased time outdoors in schools, to slow the onset of myopia, with clinical methods for slowing myopic progression, should lead to the control of this epidemic, which would otherwise pose a major health challenge. Reforms to the organization of school systems to reduce intense early competition for accelerated learning pathways may also be important. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: The increasing prevalence of high myopia and its associated pathologies has raised challenges to ophthalmic services. This project aims to explore the onset and progression of myopic pathologies in highly myopic eyes through a prospective research cohort established in South China., METHODS: Patients with high myopia (sphere <= -6.00 D) visiting the optometric clinic of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC) were invited to participate in the baseline examinations and follow-up visit over a 10-year period. People having secondary myopia, history of any refractive surgery, significant ocular media opacity, or other severe health problems were excluded. The measurements included visual acuity, ocular biometry, visual function, cycloplegic refraction, fundus imaging, ocular shape by MRI, blood tests and questionnaires., RESULTS: A total of 890 participants completed the baseline examinations, with a mean age at baseline of 22.7 +/- 12.4 years. The mean spherical equivalent at baseline was 10.13 +/- 3.65 D, and the mean axial length (AL) was 27.52 +/- 1.63 mm. The older subjects tended to have more severe myopia and longer ALs., CONCLUSION: The study will provide new knowledge on the relationship between high myopia and pathological changes such as myopic macular degeneration and staphyloma.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of several optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings to estimate choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) activity in pathological myopia using fluorescein angiography (FA) as a reference., METHODS: This was a single-centre, retrospective study. The medical records of patients with active myopic CNV who received intravitreal bevacizumab treatment were reviewed. Parameters to monitor CNV activity were morphological features of CNV on OCT, such as CNV height, central foveal thickness, intraretinal cysts, subretinal fluid, fuzziness of the CNV border, CNV network area on FA, and haemorrhage or exudation on fundus photo., RESULTS: There were 46 patients with active CNV enrolled in this study. After intravitreal bevacizumab treatment, all the previously mentioned parameters of CNV were significantly improved. Using logistic regression analyses with backward elimination, the fuzzy border seen on OCT showed the most significant correlation with improvement of leakage on FA, when compared with other variables such as intraretinal cysts, subretinal fluid or central foveal thickness (R2=0.324, p=0.009)., CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the fuzziness of the hyper-reflective CNV margin showed the most significant improvement and the strongest correlation with the improvement of CNV leakage on FA after intravitreal bevacizumab injections, suggesting its important role as an OCT parameter for the assessment of myopic CNV activity.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine if directional or anatomical changes in tissue reflectivity of Henle fiber layer (HFL) may influence flow detection on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A)., METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of consecutive cases undergoing OCT-A. Directional changes in visualization of HFL were either produced manually by moving the beam entrance within the pupil or observed occurring naturally because of tilting of the OCT line-scan within a myopic staphyloma. Areas of enhanced HFL visualization were identified on cross-sectional and en face structural OCT scans. Visualization of OCT-A flow within the superficial and the deep capillary plexuses were compared in areas with and without enhanced HFL reflectivity., RESULTS: Fifteen eyes from 9 patients were included, with a mean age of 49.6 +/- 17.9 years. On OCT-A, retinal areas with enhanced HFL reflectivity produced manually or by scan tilting within myopic staphylomas showed no changes in the superficial capillary plexus flow. However, deep capillary plexus flow was altered by variable projection of the superficial flow onto the deeper retinal layers., CONCLUSION: Directional changes in HFL reflectivity can alter the detection of deep capillary plexus flow imaged with OCT-A by influencing the projection of superficial flow onto the deeper retinal layers. We recommend that clinicians minimize scan tilting during scan acquisition and be aware of this phenomenon in eyes with posterior staphyloma.

Y2  - 20170404//
N2  - PURPOSE: Various high-percentage high-incidence medical conditions, acute or chronic, start at a particular age of onset t1 (years), accumulate or progress rapidly, with a system time constant t0 (years), typically from 1 week to 5 years, and then level off at a plateau level [Formula: see text], ultimately affecting 10-95% of the population. This report investigates the prevalence and incidence functions for myopia and high myopia as a function of age., METHODS: Fundamental prevalence versus time and incidence versus time results allow continuous prediction of myopia and high myopia population fractions as a function of age. This is a retrospective study. Nine reports are calculated with N = 444,600 subjects. There were no interventions other than usual regular eye examinations and subsequent indicated refraction change., RESULTS: The main result is continuous prediction of myopia prevalence-time data along with incidence rate data (%/year), age of onset (years), system plateau level, and system time constant (years). These parameters apply to progressive myopia and high myopia (R < -6 D), useful over several decades., CONCLUSIONS: The primary finding of this research is that the prevalence ratio of high myopes (R < -6.0 D) to common myopes is expected to increase from 15% entering college to 45% or more after college and graduate school. These statistics are particularly relevant to the many years of study required by M.D., Ph.D., and M.D./Ph.D. programs.

N2  - AIM: This study aimed to compare the effects of toric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation with a capsular tension ring and toric IOL implantation only in patients with axial myopic astigmatism who had undergone cataract surgery., METHODS: Of 34 patients with axial myopia, 16 patients who had received IOL and capsular tension ring (CTR) implantation were included in the combined group and 18 patients who received toric IOL implantation only were included in the simple group. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were evaluated by measuring subjective refraction, residual astigmatism, and the toric IOL axis six months post-surgery., RESULTS: At six months postoperatively, the UCVA for the combined and simple groups was 4.6 +/- 0.1 and 4.5 +/- 0.2, respectively, a statistically significant difference (t = 3.531, P<0.05). The toric IOL in all of the cases was located in the capsular sac, but there were more cases with IOL rotation (12 eyes) in the simple group than in the combined group (4 eyes). The rotation angles were 20degree~30degree (one eye), 10degree~20degree (four eyes), and <10degree (seven eyes) compared with 2degree~5degree (four eyes). The residual astigmatism was -0.50 +/- 0.25 D in the combined group, not a significant difference from the predicted residual astigmatism (-0.35 +/- 0.13 D). There was a significant difference in the simple group (-1.25 +/- 0.33 D) when the predicted residual astigmatism was compared (-0.37 +/- 0.11 D) (t = -9.511, P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with axial myopic astigmatism, CTR can effectively increase the rotational stability of a toric IOL, achieving improvement in corneal astigmatism and visual acuity.

A1  - Stanca, Horia Tudor
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, predictability and stability for a cohort of myopic eyes treated by Femtosecond-LASIK procedure. Methods: 60 eyes (36 patients) with different degrees of myopia that underwent refractive surgery by using the Femtosecond-LASIK technique were prospectively evaluated for 12 months. The mean preoperative spherical equivalent value was -3.827 +/- 1.410 diopters (D) (range: -8.125 to -1.375 D). VisuMax R femtosecond laser was used for cutting the corneal flap and then the Mel80 R excimer laser for the stromal ablation. Results: Mean age was 30.80 +/- 5.745 years (range: 21 to 46 years) with 75% female patients. Postoperative spherical equivalent at 12 months was within +/-0.25 D of emmetropia in 90% of the eyes and within +/-0.50 D of emmetropia in 100% of the eyes. All the eyes achieved an uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) of 1.0 (decimal scale). No eye lost lines of preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). No major intraoperative or postoperative complications were encountered. Conclusions: Femtosecond-LASIK seems to be a suitable option for the correction of mild, moderate, and high myopia, as the procedure showed to be safe, effective, and predictable for the treatment of myopic refractive errors.

N2  - Purpose: To investigate the potential role of ranibizumab treatment on the development or enlargement of chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) at the posterior pole in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV)., Methods: This observational case series included patients having high myopia spherical equivalent refractive error >= -6.00 diopters, axial length (AxL) >= 26.0 mm in both eyes, and mCNV treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg in one eye, who were retrospectively enrolled. Areas of CRA in treated and fellow eyes were measured on fundus autofluorescence images at baseline, 12, and 24 months. The CRA hypoautofluorescent lesions were divided in two groups: perilesional atrophy, corresponding to area around the mCNV, and patchy extralesional atrophy, corresponding to CRA between the temporal vascular arcades., Results: Thirty-six eyes of 18 patients were included. The mean perilesional CRA size significantly increased from baseline to 12 months (3.5 +/- 10.6 mm2, P = 0.02) and 24 months (4.4 +/- 11.7 mm2, P = 0.038) in the treated eye. In treated and not treated eyes, patchy extralesional CRA at the posterior pole increased significantly from baseline to 12 and 24 months follow-up. None of the fellow eyes developed mCNV. No significant relationship was found between the number of injections, AxL, age, and perilesional and patchy extralesional CRA in the treated and not treated eyes (P > 0.05)., Conclusions: In eyes with pathologic myopia and mCNV, intravitreal injections of ranibizumab should not be considered as a contributing risk factor worsening the natural course of CRA, even though the risk of the perilesional CRA enlargement should be taken into account.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Knobloch Syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by occipital skull defects and vitreoretinal degeneration. Retinal detachment (RD) often occurs at the end of the first decade of life or later. Aside from occipital skull defects, central nervous system abnormalities are uncommon., CASE PRESENTATIONS: We report on two siblings with KS. The first, a seven month old male, presented with nystagmus and was found to have a serous RD and a tessellated retinal appearance. His sister had a history of multiple visual abnormalities and had a similar retinal appearance although no signs of RD, but retina staphylomas. Genetic testing performed on both siblings showed a mutation in COL18A1, diagnostic of KS. MRI of both siblings demonstrated polymicrogyria but did not show occipital defects., CONCLUSIONS: Although several families with KS have been described previously, our case is noteworthy for several reasons. The RD observed in our first patient occurred at an early age, and we find evidence of only one patient with KS who had an RD identified at an earlier age. The findings of polymicrogyria are not characteristic of KS, and we found only a few previous reports of this association. Additionally, we review potential treatment options for this condition.

N2  - PURPOSE: To expand our understanding of the uncommon entity, referred to as perifoveal exudative vascular anomalous complex (PEVAC) by describing multimodal imaging findings, including optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A)., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., METHODS: Patients diagnosed with PEVAC were identified at 4 retina referral centers worldwide and underwent complete ophthalmologic examination including structural OCT, OCT-A, fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Demographics and clinical findings were analyzed at baseline and at available follow-ups., RESULTS: Fifteen eyes (15 patients, mean age 73 +/- 13 years) were included. Six of 15 eyes were diagnosed with coincident age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 2 with myopic macular degeneration. On fundus examination PEVAC presented as a large perifoveal isolated aneurysm, unifocal in 12 of 15 eyes, associated with small retinal hemorrhages and intraretinal exudation. On structural OCT, PEVAC appeared as a round hyperreflective lesion with hyporeflective lumen, typically surrounded by intraretinal cystic spaces. Dye angiography demonstrated a well-defined hyperfluorescent lesion with variable leakage on FA and without leakage on ICGA. OCT-A showed flow signal correlating with the aneurysmal lesion connecting to retinal capillary plexuses. Seven patients were followed for 13.0 +/- 10.5 months with no evidence of functional/anatomic changes. Three patients underwent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) intravitreal injections without improvement. Two eyes were associated with a type 3 neovascularization eccentric to PEVAC., CONCLUSIONS: PEVAC is an isolated, perifoveal, aneurysmal abnormality, occurring in otherwise healthy patients who may manifest other macular disease including AMD and myopic macular degeneration. PEVAC did not typically respond to anti-VEGF therapy, and may be associated with type 3 neovascularization. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is one of the most vision-impairing complications in patients with pathologic myopia. It is also one of the most frequently encountered non.age-related macular degeneration causes of CNV and affects young patients in the working age group. Fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) are generally indicated to confirm the diagnosis of active myopic CNV before initiation of treatment. Without treatment, natural history studies have shown that the vision outcome can be very poor. More recently, a number of retrospective, prospective and phase 3, multicenter, randomized controlled trials have established the safety and efficacy of intravitreal anti.vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents for the treatment of myopic CNV. Long-term follow-up studies have found that some of the initial vision gained after intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy may not be maintained, owing to the presence and progression of chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) adjacent to the CNV. Further research on clinical and imaging characteristics may elucidate the prognostic factors that are crucial to optimizing the treatment and prevention of visual impairment associated with myopic CNV.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim is to evaluate the association between high myopia and genetic variant in the BicC family RNA binding protein 1 (BICC1) as well as its association with Ras protein specific guanine nucleotide releasing factor 1 (RASGRF1) genes in a Chinese Han population with a case-control study., METHODS: Five TagSNPs in BICC1 and RASGRF1 genes were selected and genotyped in 821 unrelated subjects, which composed of 419 controls (spherical equivalent within +/-1.00 D in both eyes and axial length 24.0 mm) and 402 cases (spherical equivalent <=-6.0D in at least one eye and axial length >=26.0 mm). Statistical analysis was performed with SNPstats., RESULTS: After an analysis adjusted by age and sex, rs4245599 in BICC1 was found to be significantly associated with high myopia under the codominant, dominant, recessive and log-additive model (P = 0.001, 0.0015, 0.0045 and 2e-04, odds ratio [OR] = 2.15, 1.59, 1.73 and 1.46, respectively), and rs10763559 in BICC1 was associated with high myopia and under the dominant and log-additive model (P = 0.032 and 0.036, OR = 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). Rs4778879 in RASGRF1 was found to be significantly associated with high myopia under codominant, dominant, recessive, and log-additive model (P = 0.0088, 0.0065, 0.026, and 0.0021, OR = 1.87, 1.48, 1.56, and 1.37, respectively). However, no significant association was found between rs745030 in RASGRF1 and high myopia, neither was there any association of rs745029 in RASGRF1., CONCLUSION: The present study indicated that genetic variants in BICC1 and RASGRF1 are closely associated with high myopia, which appears to be a potential candidate for high myopia in Chinese Han population. Considering the small sample size of this study, further work is needed to validate our results. The function of BICC1 and RASGRF1 in the process of developing high myopia needs to be explored in the future.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To determine the prevalence and associated factors for myopia and high myopia among older population in a rural community in Eastern China., METHODS: A community-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Weitang town located in Suzhou, an urban metropolis in East China. A total of 5613 Chinese residents aged 60 years and older were invited to complete a questionnaire and participated in a detailed eye examination,including measurements of visual acuity and refractive error using autorefraction and subjective refraction. Myopia and high myopia was defined as SE < -0.5 diopters (D) and < -5.0 D, respectively., RESULTS: Among the 5613 participating individuals, 4795 (85.4%) complete refraction data of phakic right eye was included for analysis. The age-adjusted prevalence was 21.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.9-22.2) for myopia and 2.5% (95% CI, 2.1-2.9) for high myopia. The prevalence of myopia tended to increase significantly with age(p < 0.001),and women had a higher rate of myopia than men (p < 0.001). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, adults who were older (odds ration[OR]:1.05; 95% CI:1.04-1.07), spent more time for sleeping at night (OR:1.12;95% CI: 1.06-1.18),or had cataract (OR:1.60;95% CI:1.36-1.88) and family history of myopia (OR:1.47;95% CI:1.23-1.77), are more susceptible to myopia (p < 0.001). People who had older age, family history, cataract and specially longer night-time sleep duration, would have a higher risk of myopia., CONCLUSION: Myopia and high myopia among rural old adult population in Eastern China presents common. The current literature unanticipated suggests that there was a positive significant association between prevalence of myopia and night-time sleep duration among adult. Our data provide some evidence of this relationship and highlight the need for larger studies to further investigate this relationship longitudinally and explore mechanism therein.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and choroidal and retinal thickness values between high myopes without myopic maculopathy and emmetropes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case control study where 53 myopes with axial length (AL) above 26 mm without myopic maculopathy and 53 age-matched emmetropes with AL between 21.50 and 24.50 were included as controls. Complete ophthalmological examination and biometry were performed. Choroidal and individual retinal layer thickness maps using spectral domain optical coherence tomography were obtained in the macular and peripapillary area with enhanced depth imaging. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness was obtained using the circular 12degreediameter scan., RESULTS: Mean age was 31.9 +/- 9.9 and 32.5 +/- 9.3 years in the myopes and controls, respectively (p > 0.05). Mean BCVA was 55.32 +/- 2.50 versus 57.04 +/- 2.27 ETDRS letters, in the myopes and controls, respectively (p = 0.0004). AL was the principal predictive factor for macular and peripapillary CT in myopes and macular CT in controls. BCVA was not influenced by choroidal thickness (CT). BCVA positively correlated with global pRNFL, following correction for age and AL, in both groups (r = 0.38, p = 0.008 and r = 0.38, p = 0.007 in the myopic and control groups, respectively). Statistical analysis following correction for the potential confounding factors of age, gender, AL, gender, AL, macular CT, and peripapillary CT, showed no significant differences in macular and peripapillary thicknesses between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: AL is the principal predictive factor for macular and peripapillary CT in high myopes without maculopathy, and CT is not an independent predictor of visual acuity. Global pRNFL thickness is the only independent predictive factor of BCVA.

N2  - Based on the Beijing Eye Study 2011, a detailed ophthalmic examination was performed including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) with enhanced depth imaging for measurement of subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and relative height of posterior scleral staphyloma. OCT images were obtained in 103 highly myopic eyes (<=-6.00 diopters) and 227 normal eyes. The mean SFCT in highly myopic eyes was 110.6 +/- 85.2 mum (range, 3 to 395 mum). The SFCT of high myopia without posterior scleral staphyloma(55 eyes) was 157.79 +/- 85.18 mum, which was significantly greater than that (54.94 +/- 49.96 mum) of high myopia with posterior scleral staphyloma (48 eyes) (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, posterior scleral staphyloma was the most important factor of choroidal thinning in high myopia (F = 22.63; P < 0.001), then age (F = 19.14; P < 0.001), axial length (F = 17.37; P < 0.001) and gender (F = 17.31; P < 0.001). The SFCT in highly myopic eyes is very thin and undergoes further thinning with increasing age and axial length (refractive error). Posterior staphyloma formation was a key factor in choroidal thinning in highly myopic eyes and to be a good indicator for risk management of choroidal thinning. Abnormalities of the choroid may play a role in the pathogenesis of myopic degeneration.

N2  - PURPOSE: Previously, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified rs13382811 (near ZFHX1B) and rs6469937 (near SNTB1) to be associated with high myopia. The present study evaluates the association of these two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with moderate to high myopia in two Chinese cohorts and two cohorts of European populations., METHODS: Two Chinese university student cohorts, including one with 300 unrelated subjects with high myopia and 308 emmetropic controls from Guangzhou and a second with 96 unrelated individuals with moderate to high myopia and 96 emmetropic controls of Chaoshanese origin in Guangzhou, were enrolled in this study. Two SNPs, rs6469937 and rs13382811, were selected for genotyping based on their reported associations with severe myopia. The SNPs were genotyped via DNA sequencing. In addition, association analysis of both SNPs was performed using genotype data from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) involving a total of 2,423 samples in two independent cohorts of European-derived populations, as follows: Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg (KORA) and TwinsUK. The allelic and genotypic distribution among cases and controls were analyzed using the Chi-square test. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the SNP-SNP interaction. Fisher's exact test was used for two-SNP comparisons., RESULTS: In the Guangzhou cohort, SNP rs13382811 near ZFHX1B showed significant association with high myopia (pallelic = 0.0001, pgenotypic = 4.07 x 10-5), with the minor T allele showing an increased risk of high myopia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28-2.20). SNP rs6469937 near SNTB1 showed nominal evidence of association (pallelic = 0.0085, pgenotypic = 0.0166), which did not withstand correction for multiple testing. No significant association was detected in the smaller Chaoshan cohort alone. The association of SNPs rs13382811 and rs6469937 remained significant when both Han Chinese cohorts were combined (pallelic = 0.0033 and 0.0016, respectively), and it was also significant under the genotypic test (pgenotypic = 0.0036 and 0.0053, respectively). When both SNPs were considered together under a recessive model, their significance increased (p = 8.37 x 10-4), as did their effect (OR = 4.09, 95%CI = 1.7-9.8). The association between either of these two SNPs alone and myopia did not replicate significantly in the combined cohorts of European descent, providing only suggestive results (pallelic = 0.0088 for rs13382811 and pallelic = 0.0319 for rs6469937). However, the effects of the combined SNPs showed significant association (p = 8.2 x 10-4; OR = 1.56, 95%CI = 1.2-2.0). While the risk for myopia increased with risk alleles from both SNPs, the increase was additive rather representing a multiplicative interaction in both populations., CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the two susceptibility loci ZFHX1B and SNTB1 are associated with moderate to high myopia in a Han Chinese population, as well as in a European population, when both SNPs are combined. These results confirm previous reports of their associations, extend these observations to a European population, and suggest that additional interactive and possibly population-specific genetic or environmental factors may affect their contribution to myopia.

N2  - Purpose: Pathologic myopia described as myopia accompanied by severe deformation of the eye besides excessive elongation of eye, is usually a genetic heterogeneous disorder characterized by extreme, familial, early-onset vision loss. However, the exact pathogenesis of pathologic myopia remains unclear. In this study, we screened a Han Chinese family with pathologic myopia to identify the causative mutation and explore the possible pathogenic mechanism based on evaluation of the biological functions of the mutation., Methods: We identified the mutations in a family with pathologic myopia by single nucleotide polymorphism array combined with short tandem repeat microsatellite marker analysis and exome sequencing. Mutations were validated among family members by direct Sanger sequencing. The subcellular localization of the protein variant was investigated by immunofluorescence, and the stability of the mutant protein was determined by immunoblotting. Intracellular levels of adenosine triphosphate and reactive oxygen species and complex I activity were measured by traditional biochemical methods to determine the functional role of the disease-associated mutation., Results: The novel missense mutation: c.798C>G (p.Asp266Glu) in NDUFAF7, cosegregated with the disease and the resulting amino acid substitution affected a highly conserved residue in its protein. The mutation D266E in NDUFAF7 impaired complex I activity, which resulted in decreased ATP levels in cultured cells., Conclusions: We propose that the heterozygous mutation (c.798C>G) in NDUFAF7 may contribute to the pathogenesis of pathologic myopia, possibly by interfering with the phototransduction cascade. Mitochondrial dysfunction during eye development may lead to pathologic myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate functional prognostic factors and neuroretinal changes after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in patients with naive, recent myopic neovascularization (mCNV), as assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)., METHODS: Specific changes in tomographic features between baseline and final follow-up were retrospectively evaluated by two examiners independently. Imaging was obtained by a multi-modal imaging system which combines fluorescein angiography and SD-OCT., RESULTS: Twenty-two eyes (male, six; female, 16; mean age, 65 +/- 14 years) were considered. Mean follow-up was 21.5 +/- 14 months. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved from 0.38 +/- 0.26 to 0.16 +/- 0.20 logMAR (p < 0.001). The ellipsoid zone and the external limiting membrane (ELM) were disrupted in 21 (95.5%) and 15 (68.2%) eyes at baseline, and in 16 (72.7%) and nine (40.9%) eyes after therapy respectively. The ellipsoid zone and ELM were typically intact at lesion margins in 13 (59.1%) and 19 eyes (86.5%) respectively at baseline. The inner retina was intact in 20 eyes (91%). Six eyes (27.3%) exhibited complete regression without fibrosis. Absence of hemorrhage and integrity of lesion-adjacent ELM and of lesion-adjacent ellipsoid zone at baseline were factors for better final BCVA (p <= 0.05) CONCLUSION: Vision gain might occur despite ellipsoid zone or ELM restoration. Hemorrhage could be considered a negative prognostic factor, integrity of lesion-adjacent ELM and of lesion-adjacent ellipsoid zone as positive prognostic factors. Myopic CNV can also resolve completely without fibrosis.

N2  - TOPIC: The aim of this article is to review and compile available information on the classification, pathophysiology, and clinical features of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV); to describe the latest data on the management of this disease; and to present guidance., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the United States, myopia affects approximately 34 million people (2010), and similar figures have been reported in Europe. Pathologic myopia (PM), a possible consequence of myopia, is estimated to affect up to 3% of the global population. One of the most serious complications of PM is myopic CNV, which often leads to a sudden onset but progressive decline in central vision and is associated with a poor prognosis unless treated. Furthermore, 35% of patients with myopic CNV develop bilateral disease in the fellow eye within 8 years. Although intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies have had a major impact on the management of patients with myopic CNV, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of this condition and how to best administer treatment. Additionally, the long-term safety and efficacy of these treatments are largely unknown., METHODS: We carried out a literature review (September 2015) of all English-language articles in PubMed resulting from searches of the following terms: "choroidal neovascularization" AND "myopia" OR "myopic macular degeneration" OR "degenerative myopia" OR "myopic maculopathy" OR "myopic retinopathy" OR "pathological myopia" OR "pathologic myopia.", RESULTS: We screened a total of 566 abstracts, and 250 articles were deemed relevant for full publication review. We excluded a further 71, but an additional 44 articles were identified. This resulted in 223 articles being used to develop this review., CONCLUSIONS: Highly myopic patients experiencing a sudden loss of central vision should be referred for further examination. Once a diagnosis of myopic CNV has been confirmed, after fluorescein angiography, treatment initiation should be prompt and anti-VEGF agents considered as first-line therapy, unless contraindicated. Continued monitoring of patients is required to assess any progression or recurrence of the condition. Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical profile, systemic risk factors, and characteristics of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) in pseudophakic and phakic eyes., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study., PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology, Rawalpindi from August 2013 to August 2015., METHODOLOGY: A total of 164 eyes (96 pseudophakic patients and 68 phakic patients) with RRD were analyzed. Demographic data and associated known risk factors of study population were acquired. Retinal examination was done by single experienced retinal surgeon using indirect ophthalmoscopy for type of retinal break, location and number of retinal breaks, status of macula, morphological extent of RRD and retinal degenerations. All the findings were endorsed on a pre-devised proforma., RESULTS: Mean age of patients in pseudophakic and phakic groups was 61.18 +/-10.39 and 59.27 +/-9.57 years, respectively. Frequency of male patients in pseudophakic and phakic groups was 74% and 57.4%, respectively. Mean axial length in pseudophakic and phakic groups was 23.13 +/-2.18 mm and 21.9 +/-2.01 mm, respectively. Difference in axial length and gender distribution between two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Difference in frequency of patients with history of hypertension and myopia between two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Characteristics of RRD (type, location and number of retinal breaks, macula status, and extent of RRD) between groups were not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: RRD is more common in pseudophakic patients with male gender, increased axial length, myopia, and hypertension.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe refractive outcomes and complications after implantable collamer lens (ICL) implantation., DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional case series., METHODS: A database search of ICL surgeries over a 5-year period (2009-2013) was conducted, and 83 eyes of 44 patients were included. The Visian ICL (STAAR Surgical, Monrovia, Calif.) was used in all eyes. The primary outcome measure was postoperative uncorrected distance acuity (UCDA). Secondary outcomes include predictability, safety, and adverse events., RESULTS: Mean age was 31 years, and 59% of patients were female. Mean observation time was 14.9 months. Mean manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE) was -11.1 +/- 3.24 D preoperatively and -0.18 D +/- 0.57 D postoperatively. Mean astigmatism was -1.90 +/- 1.34 D, and 82% of eyes received toric ICLs, 93.4% of eyes achieved 20/40 UCDA, and 50.8% achieved 20/20 at last observation; 67.1% and 89.5% of eyes had MRSE within 0.5 and 1.00 D of target refraction, respectively. Safety index was 1.16 and overall improvement of 0.060 logMAR was observed. Eight (10.5%) eyes had residual astigmatism with 5 (6.5%) requiring laser enhancement. Glare and haloes were reported in 6 eyes (7.9%). Three eyes developed cataract. One eye had a retinal detachment., CONCLUSIONS: Toric and nontoric ICL implantations show promising refractive outcomes and acceptable safety in moderate to high myopes and can be considered for patients who are noncandidates for refractive laser surgery.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate factors associated with ocular axial elongation and myopia progression during a 4-year follow-up in primary school children in Beijing., METHODS: This school-based study included 382 grade-1 children at baseline in 2011 (age:6.3+/-0.4 years) with 305 (79.8%) returning for the follow-up examination in 2015. At baseline and in yearly follow-up examinations, the children underwent a comprehensive eye examination including auto-refractometry, ocular biometry with measurement of axial length, and fundus photography. The parents underwent a standardized interview., RESULTS: During the study period, the mean axial length elongated by 1.15+/-0.56mm in boys and 1.10+/-0.63mm in girls. At baseline and at the end of follow-up, axial length was significantly (P<0.001) longer in boys, with no difference (P = 0.50) between genders in axial elongation. In multivariate analysis, greater axial elongation was associated (regression coefficient r2:0.15) with less time spent outdoors (P = 0.004; standardized coefficient beta: -0.22), more time spent indoors with studying (P = 0.02; beta: 0.18) and paternal myopia (P = 0.03; beta: 0.16). Larger increases in the axial length/anterior corneal curvature (AL/CC) ratio were associated (r2:0.09) with less time spent outdoors (PP = 0.003; beta: -0.22) and maternal myopia (PP = 0.02; beta: 0.18)., CONCLUSIONS: Myopic axial elongation during a 4-year follow-up was associated with shorter time spent outdoors and longer time spent indoors studying and with parental myopia. Other factors such as level of paternal education, family income, gender and region of habitation were significantly associated with axial elongation and with myopia progression only in univariate analysis.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the long-term visual outcomes and risk factors for visual loss in children with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) who underwent angle surgery over a 21-year period., METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent trabeculotomy, trabeculectomy, or combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy for PCG. Visual acuity (VA), surgeries, and underlying cause of visual impairment were recorded and compared. Main outcome measures were final best-corrected good VA (20/20 to 20/50), moderate VA (<20/50 to 20/200), or poor VA (<20/200); age at surgery, sex, laterality, type of initial glaucoma surgery, and number of surgeries were recorded., RESULTS: Fifty-three eyes were eligible to be included in the study. The mean logMAR VA was 0.61 +/- 0.57. A good VA was attained in 51%, moderate VA in 30%, and poor VA in 19%. The main cause of visual impairment with VA <20/50 was deprivation amblyopia (64%). There was no association between VA level and status of success (controlled with or without medications) (p = 0.202). The mean spherical equivalent of refraction was -4.47 +/- 5.66; myopia was the predominant refractive error (74%) and astigmatism >2 D (40%). A statistically significant high myopic shift was more frequent in the visually impaired group. None of the studied factors was statistically associated with moderate to poor visual outcome (all p>0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: A favorable VA outcome was achieved. Topical antiglaucoma medication has an adjuvant role in maintaining the success rate of surgery without risking the visual outcome. Corneal opacification and anisometropia were the cause of amblyopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate which baseline factors are predictive for axial length growth over an average period of 2.5 years in a group of children wearing orthokeratology (OK) contact lenses., METHODS: In this retrospective study, the clinical records of 249 new OK wearers between January 2012 and December 2013 from the contact lens clinic at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University were reviewed. The primary outcome measure was axial length change from baseline to the time of review (July-August 2015). Independent variables included baseline measures of age at initiation of OK wear, gender, refractive error (spherical equivalent), astigmatism, average keratometry, corneal toricity, central corneal thickness, white-to-white corneal diameter, pupil size, corneal topography eccentricity value (e-value), intraocular pressure (IOP) and total time in follow-up (months total). The contributions of all independent variables on axial length change at the time of review were assessed using univariate and multivariable regression analyses., RESULTS: Univariate analyses of the right eyes of 249 OK patients showed that smaller increases in axial length were associated with older age at the onset of OK lens wear, greater baseline spherical equivalent myopic refractive error, less time in follow-up and a smaller e-value. Multivariable analyses of the significant right eye variables showed that the factors associated with smaller axial length growth were older age at the onset of OK lens wear (p<0.0001), greater baseline spherical equivalent myopic refractive error (p = 0.0046) and less time in follow-up (p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: The baseline factors demonstrating the greatest correlation with reduced axial length elongation during OK lens wear in myopic children included greater baseline spherical equivalent myopic refractive error and older age at the onset of OK lens wear.

N2  - PURPOSE: To characterize treatment patterns and outcomes in eyes with treatment-naive myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in the United States., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 18 years and older seen in clinics participating in the American Academy of Ophthalmology's IRIS (Intelligent Research in Sight) Registry., METHODS: We analyzed data from the IRIS Registry, from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014, to identify cases of treatment-naive mCNV, which was defined as the presence of myopic refractive error worse than -6.0 diopters with the presence of subretinal/choroidal neovascularization as indicated by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis of "362.16: Retinal Neovascularization NOS.", MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of initial treatment for mCNV was categorized as the administration of 1 of the following within the first 365 days after the diagnosis date: (1) observation (i.e., no treatment); (2) intravitreal anti-VEGF injection; (3) verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT); or (4) laser photocoagulation. We assessed the difference between logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity (VA) on the diagnosis date (baseline) and 1 year after the diagnosis date. Anti-VEGF injection frequency per treated eye over a 1-year period was also estimated., RESULTS: We identified 185 patients with treatment-naive mCNV in 1 or both eyes. Treatment within 1 year of diagnosis was recorded for 73.0% (135/185); the remainder was classified as "observation." Nearly all treatment (134/135; 99.3%) consisted of anti-VEGF injections; 0.7% (1/135) received vPDT. Those treated with anti-VEGF injections showed significant improvement in VA at 1 year (mean logMAR VA improvement of 0.17 units, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.20, P < 0.01), whereas those who were not treated showed a significant decline in VA at 1 year (mean logMAR VA decline: 0.03 units, 95% CI, 0.008-0.05, P < 0.01). The mean number of anti-VEGF injections for an eye with mCNV during the first year after diagnosis was 2.8 (standard deviation, 2.5) (median, 2.0; interquartile range, 1.0-4.0)., CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, anti-VEGF injection was the most frequently utilized treatment for mCNV. Those treated were observed to gain vision. However, one quarter of patients received no treatment and lost vision. Further studies are needed to understand the sociodemographic and health-systems barriers surrounding the delivery of anti-VEGF injections to patients with mCNV.

N2  - High myopia is the common eye disorder worldwide, which may contribute to increase the risk of serious disorders including glaucoma and cataract. Although various studies including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have been implicated to identify potential biomarkers (genes or proteins) for predicting high myopia and to reveal the underlying mechanism, the comprehensive metabolomics in relation to high myopia is very limited. In this study, we identified 242 metabolites in aqueous humor (AH) from a set of 40 cataract patients (including 20 with high myopia and 20 for controls), using a non-targeted metabolomic technology, gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GC/TOF MS). Further statistical analysis showed that 29 metabolites were significantly changed (Variable important for the projection, VIP >= 1 and p <= 0.05), between those two groups, while only 2 decreased metabolites were included. Moreover, for the first time, metabolite-metabolite correlations for AH were analyzed, which may dissect key regulatory elements or pathways involved in metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Accordingly, metabolic network was constructed based on those 29 changed metabolites in patients with high myopia. More than half of the changed metabolites were highly and positively associated, suggesting important roles of pathways involved in the metabolism of these metabolites in relation to high myopia. Altogether, this work not only provided potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of high myopia formation, but also provided new insights into the underlying mechanisms.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the 1-year progression of myopia and associated risk factors in second-grade primary school children., METHODS: The myopia investigation study in Taipei provided semiannual visual acuity testing and cycloplegic refraction for all second-grade primary school children (mean age: 7.49 years) in Taipei who provided parental consent. A questionnaire was distributed to the participants' parents before the first and third examinations. We evaluated 1-year follow-up data for children noted to have myopia on the first examination. Multinomial logistic regression models were applied to assess risk factors associated with myopia progression. Myopia progression was categorised, based on the change in spherical equivalent (DELTASE) over 1 year, as slow (DELTASE>-0.5 dioptres (D)), moderate (-1.0 D<DELTASE<=-0.5 D) or fast (DELTASE<=-1.0 D). Of the 4214 myopic children, data were analysed for 3256 (77.3%) who completed the 1-year follow-up evaluation., RESULTS: The baseline SE was -1.43+/-1.1 D. The average DELTASE was -0.42+/-0.85 D, with 46.96%, 28.50% and 24.54% of the study subjects showing slow, moderate and fast myopia progression, respectively. When compared with slow myopia progression, fast myopia progression was associated with a greater myopic SE at baseline (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.72) and a shorter eye-object distance when doing near work (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.78). More outdoor activity time and self-reported cycloplegic treatment were not associated with slow myopia progression., CONCLUSIONS: Children with fast annual myopia progression were more myopic at baseline and had a shorter reading distance. Our study results highlight the importance of having children keep a proper reading distance.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the duration of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and treatment outcome after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of treatment-naive myopic CNV patients who were treated with anti-VEGF and followed for at least 24 months to identify factors predicting final outcome and recurrence., RESULTS: Among 106 eyes, a shorter duration of CNV was a significant predictor of a better final best-corrected visual acuity, even after controlling for other factors (p = 0.042). When divided into 3 groups according to CNV duration before treatment (<2, 2-8, and 8-24 weeks), the recurrence rate (19, 25, and 52%, respectively; p = 0.006) and number of injections (3.5, 4.0, and 5.5, respectively; p = 0.021) were significantly lower in eyes with a shorter duration of CNV., CONCLUSIONS: Early anti-VEGF treatment of myopic CNV decreased the recurrence rate and number of injections and improved visual outcome.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) procedures are used for the surgical treatment of macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) associated with high myopia. Re-detachment of the retina has been reported in MHRD associated with high myopia. Our aim was to evaluate the 1-year outcomes of vitrectomy, performed using an inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap technique with gas tamponade, in five cases of MHRD associated with high myopia., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of medical records of five consecutive cases of highly myopic MHRD. The following postoperative data were collected: refractive error, best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, ophthalmic fundus examination findings, ocular coherence tomography at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively; duration of the follow-up period; and intra- and postoperative complications. The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of postoperative retinal reattachment and macular hole (MH) closure. Paired t-tests were conducted to evaluate postoperative changes., RESULTS: Mean visual acuity improved significantly (P = 0.008), with an improvement of >=2 lines on LogMAR value gained in three of the five eyes. Retinal reattachment was maintained in all cases, with no cases of MH reopening identified over the mean follow-up period of 20.2 months. No complications were identified in any eye., CONCLUSIONS: The inverted ILM flap technique and gas tamponade provided primary retinal reattachment and MH closure over the >=12-month follow-up period.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the features of extrafoveal retinoschisis (EFRS) in highly myopic eyes detected by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT)., Methods: In this retrospective case series, 89 eyes of 65 patients with high myopia and coexisting EFRS were included. The participants underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity, ocular biometry, refraction, and perimetry. Three-dimensional wide-field scans were obtained with SS-OCT, and en face images were reconstructed with custom software. En face OCT features of EFRS were determined by two ophthalmologists masked to clinical characteristics. The associations of EFRS subtypes with ocular biometry and other OCT changes were evaluated as well., Results: In wide-field SS-OCT scans, EFRS was classified into three different types, the inner limiting membrane (ILM) detachment and inner and outer EFRS, according to the specific layer of the splitting. All these three types were most frequently distributed in the inferotemporal quadrant (71.2% for ILM detachment, 59.5% for inner EFRS, and 75.0% for outer EFRS). Inner limiting membrane detachment and inner EFRS were often adjacent to peripapillary atrophy. Outer EFRS tends to coexist with inner EFRS, as we did not observe any case with standalone outer EFRS or with coexisting with ILM detachment. Eyes with all three types combined had the longest axial length (29.1 +/- 1.26 mm, P = 0.003) and the greatest refractive error (-13.0 +/- 2.86 diopters [D], P = 0.014). The incidence of retinal microfolds and breaks among subgroups was significantly different (P = 0.012 and 0.003, respectively). Staphyloma was associated with outer EFRS (30.6% with versus 7.6% without outer EFRS)., Conclusions: Wide-field SS-OCT reveals the spatial distribution of retinoschisis outside the fovea, and associations with retinal vessels and other retinal landmark structures. Further observations on the longitudinal changes and functional damage would help lead to a better understanding of its mechanism and prognosis.

N2  - PURPOSE: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the association of Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) polymorphism rs6214 with high myopia through a systematic review and meta-analysis of candidate genetic association study., METHODS: All case-control association studies on IGF1 and high myopia reported up to 15 June 2016 in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Chinese Biomedical Database were retrieved. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using fixed and random effects models according to between study heterogeneity. Publication bias analyses were conducted using Begg's test., RESULTS: A total of eight studies from published articles were included in our analysis. The meta-analyses for IGF1 rs6214, composed of 4242 high myopia patients and 4430 controls, showed low heterogeneity for the included populations in all the genetic models, except that of the allelic genetic model in the pooled populations. The analyses of all the genetic models in Chinese, Japanese, and overall pooled populations did not identify any significant association between high myopia and IGF1 rs6214., CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed there was no association detected between IGF1 rs6214 and high myopia. Given the limited sample size, further investigations including more ethnic groups are required to validate the association.

N2  - PURPOSE: High myopia (HM) is a common cause of visual impairment worldwide. Previous genome-wide association studies have reported that seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs1254319, rs3138144, rs12205363, rs17648524, rs7829127, rs1656404, and rs7084402, are associated with HM in Caucasians. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of these SNPs in Han Chinese., METHODS: SNPs were genotyped by SNaPshot method in a Chinese cohort composed of 830 HM patients and 1140 controls., RESULTS: Rs17648524 (C/G) and rs7084402 (A/G) were significantly associated with HM (p = 3.0 x 10-3, OR = 0.43; p = 3.7 x 10-2, OR = 1.25, respectively). The association of rs17648524 was also observed under the heterozygous model (CG vs. GG, p = 7.0 x 10-3, OR = 0.43) and the dominant model (CC + CG vs. GG, p = 4.0 x 10-3, OR = 0.42). The association of rs7084402 was found under the homozygous model (GG vs. AA, p = 4.0 x 10-2, OR = 1.56) and the dominant model (GG+ AG vs. AA, p = 3.8 x 10-2, OR = 1.41). Another SNP, rs7829127 (A/G), was found to be significantly associated with HM under the heterozygous model (AG vs. AA, p = 4.6 x 10-2, OR = 0.67). Furthermore, the associations of rs17648524 and rs7084402 with HM were gender-specific, with significance observed only in females but not in males. As for the other four SNPs, no associations were detected under these genetic models., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested rs17648524 (intronic RBFOX1 gene) and rs7084402 (7.5kb 5' of the BICC1 gene) showed gender-specific associations with high myopia in the Han Chinese.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence and incidence of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in Taiwan, including the health care utilization and treatment-associated costs., METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using existing data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance claims database to identify patients who had a diagnosis of myopic CNV recorded from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011. The prevalence of myopic CNV was monitored during this period, and the frequency and cost of both treatment visits and monitoring visits were analyzed for 2 years following diagnosis., RESULTS: The prevalence of myopic CNV was 0.017%. In total, 9068 patients with myopic CNV were identified, 12.3% (n = 1111) of whom were treated. Of those treated, 72.0% (n = 800) received intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections (IVI); the remainder received either photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (vPDT), laser photocoagulation, or a combination of therapies. IVI was associated with the largest number of treatment visits as well as a higher administrative (non-drug) cost per treatment visit (a mean of USD 57.18). vPDT alone was associated with a higher overall cost per treatment visit and more monitoring visits than IVI or laser photocoagulation. Costs for monitoring visits were highest for IVI., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of myopic CNV was lower than that reported in previous studies, possibly because of differences in age distribution in the populations studied. The frequencies of treatment administered were similar to those reported in previous studies; however, a cost-effectiveness comparison could not be made owing to lack of data in previous studies.

N2  - PURPOSE: To identify the prognostic variables relative to myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treated with intravitreal ranibizumab/bevacizumab., METHODS: Forty-eight patients with myopic CNV were enrolled in a prospective, interventional, non-randomized 12-month study. Intravitreal ranibizumab/bevacizumab was administered in a pro-re-nata regimen and re-treatment was performed in the presence of angiographic leakage, intraretinal/subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography, new hemorrhages, five-letter decrease and increased metamorphosia. The primary outcome measures were the identification of the predictive value of symptom duration, patient's age, refractive error, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), CNV area, CNV location, retinal hemorrhages, atrophy, lacquer cracks, and CNV-fundus autofluorescence pattern (hyper-fundus autofluorescence/patchy pattern). The secondary outcomes were patients requiring either one or two injections to achieve CNV stabilization., RESULTS: The mean BCVA improved from 0.49 +/- 0.30 (logarithm of minimal angle resolution, Snellen equivalent 20/63) to 0.39 +/- 0.32 (20/49) at 1-year follow-up (P = 0.043). Univariate and multiple stepwise linear regression analysis identified baseline BCVA (P = 0.0003), symptom duration (P = 0.005), CMT (P = 0.02), and fundus autofluorescence pattern (P = 0.005) as the explanatory variables on the final BCVA and the change in the mean BCVA. Overall, patients with better baseline BCVA, early diagnosis, lower CMT, or disclosing a hyperfundus autofluorescence CNV pattern achieved better visual outcomes. Patients responding with just one to two intravitreal injections (45.8%) obtained better visual outcomes compared with patients receiving three or more injections, and this group consisted of younger patients with lesser CMT, smaller CNV area, and fewer baseline hemorrhages., CONCLUSION: Ranibizumab/bevacizumab therapy was effective in improving and maintaining visual acuity in myopic choroidal neovascularization. Early diagnosis, better baseline BCVA, and hyperfundus autofluorescence CNV pattern were strongly associated with better functional outcomes. Moreover, CNV distinguished by its small size and low CMT responded more favorably, achieving a better visual outcome.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of myopic retinopathy (MR) in rural Central India., METHODS: The population-based Central India Eye and Medical Study included 4711 subjects (aged 30+ years). The participants underwent a detailed eye examination, including fundus photography. Myopic retinopathy was defined according to the Pathologic Myopia Study Group., RESULTS: Readable fundus photographs were available on 4561 (96.8%) subjects (8846 eyes). Myopic retinopathy was present in 15 (0.17 +/- 0.04%; 95% confidence interval (CI):0.08%, 0.26%) eyes of 11 (0.24 +/- 0.07%; 95%CI: 0.01, 0.04) individuals. Myopic retinopathy occurred only in eyes with an axial length of >26 mm. Eyes with MR had significantly larger optic discs than eyes without MR (3.69 +/- 1.22 mm2 versus 2.52 +/- 0.77 mm2 ; p < 0.001). In binary regression analysis, higher prevalence of MR was associated with longer axial length (p < 0.001; odds ratio (OR): 19.6; 95%CI: 4.6, 82.9), higher prevalence of open-angle glaucoma (p = 0.02; OR: 16.1; 95%CI: 1.51, 170), lower best-corrected visual acuity (expressed in logMAR) (=0.03; OR: 0.06; 95%CI: 0.004, 0.75) and female gender (p = 0.002). If level of education was added to the model, educational level was not significantly associated with MR (p = 0.17; OR: 0.53; 95%CI: 0.22, 1.31). If gender was dropped from the model, higher prevalence of MR was associated with lower educational level (p = 0.04; OR: 0.44; 95%CI: 0.20, 0.97)., CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of MR in rural Central India was low (11/4561 or 0.2%), and correlated with a 16 times higher risk of open-angle glaucoma, after adjusting for axial length and gender. If gender was excluded from the analysis, higher prevalence of MR was associated with lower educational level. This latter finding distinguishes adult MR from today's school children myopia which is strongly associated with higher educational level.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study investigated factors associated with chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) progression in myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy., METHODS: Fifty eyes of 50 treatment-naive patients with myopic CNV who underwent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monotherapy with at least 2 years of follow-up data were included. The cumulative occurrence of CRA progression was assessed using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics including macular choroidal thickness in various areas were compared between patients with and without CRA progression., RESULTS: The mean age was 52.34 years. A mean of 4.84 anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections were performed over the mean follow-up duration of 44.6 months. Eventually, 15 eyes (30%) developed CRA progression. The estimated occurrence of CRA progression was 10% at 1 year, 19.1% at 2 years, 23.6% at 3 and 4 years, and 35.4% at 5 years. Chorioretinal atrophy progression was associated with a subfoveal CNV location (P = 0.029) and thinner subfoveal choroid in relation to the inferior choroid at 3 mm (P = 0.008). Visual improvement was only significant in eyes without CRA progression at 1 year, 2 years, and at the final visit., CONCLUSION: Chorioretinal atrophy progression was associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Relative thinning of the subfoveal choroid about the inferior choroid and subfoveal CNV location may predispose eyes with myopic CNV to develop CRA progression after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the 6-year outcome of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) to treat eyes with active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to pathologic myopia., METHODS: Medical records of 36 eyes of 35 consecutive patients with high myopia (refractive error >=8 D or axial length >=26.5 mm) and active CNV, who had been treated with IVB and followed for >=6 years were analyzed. The factors that predicted the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 6 years after IVB were determined by multiple regression analyses., RESULTS: The mean age of the subjects was 58 years, and the mean axial length was 29 mm. Twenty-one eyes had subfoveal CNV and 15 eyes had nonsubfoveal CNV. During the 6-year follow-up, the mean number of IVB was 1.78. The mean BCVA logMAR (equivalent Snellen visual acuity) was 0.50 (20/63), 0.31 (20/40), 0.39 (20/50), and 0.45 (20/63) at the baseline, and at 2, 4, and 6 years after the IVB. The BCVA was significantly improved at 2 and 4 years compared with baseline values but not at 6 years. Stepwise multiple regression analyses showed that the BVCA at 6 years was significantly correlated with the size of the CNV-related macular atrophy, and the baseline BCVA and CNV size., CONCLUSION: The significant correlation between the BCVA at 6 years and the size of the macular atrophy indicates that treatments to prevent the development of macular atrophy are important for the long-term visual outcome in eyes with active CNV.

T1  - WHAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF PATHOLOGIC MYOPIA?.
A1  - Ohno-Matsui, Kyoko
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - PURPOSE: Despite being a major cause of visual impairment worldwide, pathologic myopia has not been clearly and consistently defined. This lack of a standardized definition has made comparisons among epidemiological studies difficult. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to summarize the definitions of pathologic myopia., METHODS: A literature search was conducted of Pubmed to identify reports presenting definitions of pathologic myopia., RESULTS: Although cut-off values for refractive error and increased axial length have been used in some studies, a definition based solely on such values is considered to just show a 'high degree of myopia'. Similarly, the presence of myopic fundus lesions in addition to a high degree of myopia has been used to define pathologic myopia; however, such lesions often develop with age and they are not characteristic of pathologic myopia., CONCLUSION: So, what is pathologic myopia? This review covers the various proposed definitions for pathologic myopia, and describes its major features such as posterior staphyloma, variation in axial length, and the presence of myopic maculopathy. Some unanswered questions that serve as signposts to areas of interest for future research have also been discussed.

N2  - PURPOSE: To examine an association between high myopia and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in diabetic patients with high myopic anisometropia., METHODS: A total of 116 white diabetic patients (232 eyes) with high myopia (spherical equivalent > -5.00 diopters, D) anisometropia (difference >= -6 D) were enrolled in this cross-sectional, contralateral eye study. The frequency of DR was compared between the high myopic and the contralateral eyes., RESULTS: Compared with the fellow eyes, DR was significantly less frequent in high myopic side (27.6% vs. 100%, P < 0.001; relative risk, 0.28 with 95% confidence interval of 0.21-0.37). Similar significant trends were found for the incidence of nonproliferative (27.6% vs. 69%, P < 0.001) and proliferative DR (0% vs. 31%, P < 0.001). Diabetic retinopathy was also less severe in the same group., CONCLUSION: Using a contralateral eye study design prevented the influence of potential confounding factors inherent in similar previous case-control studies. On this basis, a protective role for high myopia against DR was established.

N2  - PURPOSE: To identify the risk factors for the development of macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) after vitrectomy without internal limiting membrane peeling for pathologic MF., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 131 eyes (115 patients) treated with vitrectomy for pathologic MF from 2009 to 2014. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refractive error, axial length, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography findings were analyzed., RESULTS: Postoperative MHRD developed in 7 eyes (5.3%). Between patients with or without secondary MHRD after vitrectomy, there were no significant differences in age, sex, axial length, preoperative BCVA, refractive error, lens status, and presence of posterior staphyloma. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed all 7 eyes (100%) had foveal detachment, while only 47 patients (37.9%) of 124 eyes had foveal detachment (P = 0.004). There was no significant difference between preoperative and postoperative BCVA in the 7 eyes with MHRD. The postoperative BCVA in the 124 eyes without MHRD was significantly improved (P < 0.001). Among the 124 eyes, both preoperative and postoperative BCVA of eyes with foveal detachment was worse than the eyes without foveal detachment (P < 0.001, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Preoperative foveal detachment is a risk factor for the development of MHRD after vitrectomy for pathologic MF.

N2  - PURPOSE: To systematically review epidemiologic and laboratory studies on the etiology of high myopia and its links to pathologic myopia., METHODS: Regular Medline searches have been performed for the past 20 years, using "myopia" as the basic search term. The abstracts of all articles have been scrutinized for relevance, and where necessary, translations of articles in languages other than English were obtained., RESULTS: Systematic review shows that there is an epidemic of myopia and high myopia in young adults in East and Southeast Asia, with similar but smaller trends in other parts of the world. This suggests an impending epidemic of pathologic myopia. High myopia in young adults in East and Southeast Asia is now predominantly associated with environmental factors, rather than genetic background. Recent clinical trials show that the onset of myopia can be reduced by increasing the time children spend outdoors, and methods to slow the progression of myopia are now available., CONCLUSION: High myopia is now largely associated with environmental factors that have caused the epidemic of myopia in East and Southeast Asia. An important clinical question is whether the pathologic consequences of acquired high myopia are similar to those associated with classic genetic high myopia. Increased time outdoors can be used to slow the onset of myopia, whereas methods for slowing progression are now available clinically. These approaches should enable the current epidemics of myopia and high myopia to be turned around, preventing an explosion of pathologic myopia.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) have been shown to influence the development of form-deprivation myopia. However, genetic association between these two genes and high myopia remains inconsistent in different studies. This study was conducted to investigate the association between IGF1and IGF1R and high myopia in a Han Chinese population., METHODS: Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IGF1 and IGF1R genes were genotyped by SNaPshot method in a Han Chinese subject group composed of 1244 high myopia patients and 1380 controls. The genotyping data was analyzed by chi2 test and the linkage disequilibrium block structure was examined by Haploview software., RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the allele frequencies of IGF1 and IGF1R SNPs and genotypes between patients and controls after Bonferroni multiple-correction (p > 0.05). However, the G allele of rs35766 in the IGF1 gene showed a protective effect for high myopia (p = 0.015, corrected p = 0.21, odds ratio [OR] = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.70-0.97). The carriers of rs35766GG and rs35766GG+AG genotypes displayed a decreased risk of high myopia compared with rs35766AA carriers (p = 0.012, OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.47-0.91; p = 0.019, OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.50-0.94, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in the IGF1 and IGF1R genes might not be associated with high myopia in Han Chinese. Further studies are needed to verify the possible function of IGF1 and IGF1R in the development of myopia.

N2  - Previous studies have identified many genetic loci for refractive error and myopia. We aimed to investigate the effect of these loci on ocular biometry as a function of age in children, adolescents, and adults. The study population consisted of three age groups identified from the international CREAM consortium: 5,490 individuals aged <10 years; 5,000 aged 10-25 years; and 16,274 aged >25 years. All participants had undergone standard ophthalmic examination including measurements of axial length (AL) and corneal radius (CR). We examined the lead SNP at all 39 currently known genetic loci for refractive error identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as a combined genetic risk score (GRS). The beta coefficient for association between SNP genotype or GRS versus AL/CR was compared across the three age groups, adjusting for age, sex, and principal components. Analyses were Bonferroni-corrected. In the age group <10 years, three loci (GJD2, CHRNG, ZIC2) were associated with AL/CR. In the age group 10-25 years, four loci (BMP2, KCNQ5, A2BP1, CACNA1D) were associated; and in adults 20 loci were associated. Association with GRS increased with age; beta = 0.0016 per risk allele (P = 2 x 10-8 ) in <10 years, 0.0033 (P = 5 x 10-15 ) in 10- to 25-year-olds, and 0.0048 (P = 1 x 10-72 ) in adults. Genes with strongest effects (LAMA2, GJD2) had an early effect that increased with age. Our results provide insights on the age span during which myopia genes exert their effect. These insights form the basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying high and pathological myopia. Copyright © 2016 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.

N2  - PURPOSE: Historical reports suggest febrile illness during childhood is a risk factor for myopia. The establishment of the UK Biobank provided a unique opportunity to investigate this relationship., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied a sample of UK Biobank participants of White ethnicity aged 40-69 years old who underwent autorefraction (N=91 592) and were classified as myopic (<=-0.75 Dioptres (D)), highly myopic (<=-6.00 D), or non-myopic (>-0.75 D). Self-reported age at diagnosis of past medical conditions was ascertained during an interview with a nurse at a Biobank assessment centre. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for myopia or high myopia associated with a diagnosis before age 17 years of each of nine febrile illnesses, after adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, highest educational qualification, and birth order)., RESULTS: Rubella, mumps, and pertussis were associated with myopia: rubella, OR=1.38, 95% CI: 1.03-1.85, P=0.030; mumps, OR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.07-1.64, P=0.010; and pertussis, OR=1.39, 95% CI 1.03-1.87, P=0.029. Measles, rubella, and pertussis were associated with high myopia: measles, OR=1.48, 95% CI: 1.07-2.07, P=0.019; rubella, OR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.12-3.35, P=0.017; and pertussis, OR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.24-3.71, P=0.006. The evidence did not support an interaction between education and febrile illness in explaining the above risks., CONCLUSION: A history of childhood measles, rubella, or pertussis was associated with high myopia, whereas a history of childhood rubella, mumps, or pertussis was associated with any myopia. The reasons for these associations are unclear.

N2  - The aim of this study was to describe a new pathogenic variant in the mutational hot spot exon ORF15 of retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) gene within an Italian family with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP), detailing its distinctive genotype-phenotype correlation with pathologic myopia (PM). All members of this RP-PM family underwent a complete ophthalmic examination. The entire open reading frames of RPGR and retinitis pigmentosa 2 genes were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. A novel frame-shift mutation in exon ORF15 of RPGR gene (c.2091_2092insA; p.A697fs) was identified as hemizygous variant in the male proband with RP, and as heterozygous variant in the females of this pedigree who invariably exhibited symmetrical PM in both eyes. The c.2091_2092insA mutation coherently co-segregated with the observed phenotypes. These findings expand the spectrum of X-linked RP variants. Interestingly, focusing on Caucasian ethnicity, just three RPGR mutations are hitherto reported in RP-PM families: one of these is located in exon ORF15, but none appears to be characterized by a high penetrance of PM trait as observed in the present, relatively small, pedigree. The geno-phenotypic attributes of this heterozygosity suggest that gain-of-function mechanism could give rise to PM via a degenerative cell-cell remodeling of the retinal structures.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) is a common complication of pathological myopia. Once developed, most eyes with myopic CNV (mCNV) experience a progression to macular atrophy, which leads to irreversible vision loss. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is used to treat diseases characterised by neovascularisation and is increasingly used to treat mCNV., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), compared with other treatments, sham treatment or no treatment, in people with pathological myopia., SEARCH METHODS: We searched a number of electronic databases including CENTRAL and Ovid MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. Electronic databases were last searched on 16 June 2016., SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing anti-VEGF therapy with another treatment (e.g. photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin, laser photocoagulation, macular surgery, another anti-VEGF), sham treatment or no treatment in participants with mCNV., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional data. We analysed outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs). We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE., MAIN RESULTS: The present review included six studies which provided data on the comparison between anti-VEGF with PDT, laser, sham treatment and another anti-VEGF treatment, with 594 participants with mCNV. Three trials compared bevacizumab or ranibizumab with PDT, one trial compared bevacizumab with laser, one trial compared aflibercept with sham treatment, and two trials compared bevacizumab with ranibizumab. Pharmaceutical companies conducted two trials. The trials were conducted at multiple clinical centres across three continents (Europe, Asia and North America). In all these six trials, one eye for each participant was included in the study.When compared with PDT, people treated with anti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab (one RCT), bevacizumab (two RCTs)), were more likely to regain vision. At one year of follow-up, the mean visual acuity (VA) in participants treated with anti-VEGFs was -0.14 logMAR better, equivalent of seven Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters, compared with people treated with PDT (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.20 to -0.08, 3 RCTs, 263 people, low-certainty evidence). The RR for proportion of participants gaining 3+ lines of VA was 1.86 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.73, 2 RCTs, 226 people, moderate-certainty evidence). At two years, the mean VA in people treated with anti-VEGFs was -0.26 logMAR better, equivalent of 13 ETDRS letters, compared with people treated with PDT (95% CI -0.38 to -0.14, 2 RCTs, 92 people, low-certainty evidence). The RR for proportion of people gaining 3+ lines of VA at two years was 3.43 (95% CI 1.37 to 8.56, 2 RCTs, 92 people, low-certainty evidence). People treated with anti-VEGFs showed no obvious reduction (improvement) in central retinal thickness at one year compared with people treated with PDT (MD -17.84 mum, 95% CI -41.98 to 6.30, 2 RCTs, 226 people, moderate-certainty evidence). There was low-certainty evidence that people treated with anti-VEGF were more likely to have CNV angiographic closure at 1 year (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54, 2 RCTs, 208 people). One study allowed ranibizumab treatment as of month 3 in participants randomised to PDT, which may have led to an underestimate of the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment.When compared with laser photocoagulation, there was more improvement in VA among bevacizumab-treated people than among laser-treated people after one year (MD -0.22 logMAR, equivalent of 11 ETDRS letters, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.01, 1 RCT, 36 people, low-certainty evidence) and after two years (MD -0.29 logMAR, equivalent of 14 ETDRS letters, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.08, 1 RCT, 36 people, low-certainty evidence). When compared with sham treatment, people treated with aflibercept had better vision at one year (MD -0.19 logMAR, equivalent of 9 ETDRS letters, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.12, 1 RCT, 121 people, moderate-certainty evidence). The fact that this study allowed for aflibercept treatment at 6 months in the control group might cause an underestimation of the benefit with anti-VEGF.People treated with ranibizumab had similar improvement in VA recovery compared with people treated with bevacizumab after one year (MD -0.02 logMAR, equivalent of 1 ETDRS letter, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.06, 2 RCTs, 80 people, moderate-certainty evidence). Of the included six studies, two studies reported no adverse events in either group and two industry-sponsored studies reported both systemic and ocular adverse events. In the control group, there were no systemic or ocular adverse events reported in 149 participants. Fifteen people reported systemic serious adverse events among 359 people treated with anti-VEGF agents (15/359, 4.2%). Five people reported ocular adverse events among 359 people treated with anti-VEGF agents (5/359, 1.4%). The number of adverse events was low, and the estimate of RR was uncertain regarding systemic serious adverse events (4 RCTs, 15 events in 508 people, RR 4.50, 95% CI 0.60 to 33.99, very low-certainty evidence) and serious ocular adverse events (4 RCTs, 5 events in 508 people, RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.23 to 14.71, very low-certainty evidence). There were no reports of mortality or cases of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment. There was sparse reporting of data for vision-related quality of life (in favour of anti-VEGF) in only one trial at one year of follow-up. The studies did not report data for other outcomes, such as percentage of participants with newly developed chorioretinal atrophy., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low to moderate-certainty evidence from RCTs for the efficacy of anti-VEGF agents to treat mCNV at one year and two years. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests ranibizumab and bevacizumab are equivalent in terms of efficacy. Adverse effects occurred rarely and the trials included here were underpowered to assess these. Future research should be focused on the efficacy and safety of different drugs and treatment regimens, the efficacy on different location of mCNV, as well as the effects on practice in the real world.

N2  - The prevalence of myopia in developed countries in East and Southeast Asia has increased to more than 80% in children completing schooling, whereas that of high myopia has increased to 10%-20%. This poses significant challenges for correction of refractive errors and the management of pathological high myopia. Prevention is therefore an important priority. Myopia is etiologically heterogeneous, with a low level of myopia of clearly genetic origins that appears without exposure to risk factors. The big increases have occurred in school myopia, driven by increasing educational pressures in combination with limited amounts of time spent outdoors. The rise in prevalence of high myopia has an unusual pattern of development, with increases in prevalence first appearing at approximately age 11. This pattern suggests that the increasing prevalence of high myopia is because of progression of myopia in children who became myopic at approximately age 6 or 7 because age-specific progression rates typical of East Asia will take these children to the threshold for high myopia in 5 to 6 years. This high myopia seems to be acquired, having an association with educational parameters, whereas high myopia in previous generations tended to be genetic in origin. Increased time outdoors can counter the effects of increased nearwork and reduce the impact of parental myopia, reducing the onset of myopia, and this approach has been validated in 3 randomized controlled trials. Other proposed risk factors need further work to demonstrate that they are independent and can be modified to reduce the onset of myopia.

N2  - Myopia is not a simple refractive error, but an eyesight-threatening disease. There is a high prevalence of myopia, 80% to 90%, in young adults in East Asia; myopia has become the leading cause of blindness in this area. As the myopic population increases globally, the severity of its impact is predicted. Approximately one fifth of the myopic population has high myopia (>=-6 diopters), which results in irreversible vision loss such as retinal detachment, choroidal neovascularization, cataracts, glaucoma, and macular atrophy. The increasing prevalence of school myopia in the past few decades may be a result of gene-environment interactions. However, earlier school myopia onset would accompany faster myopia progression and greater risk of high myopia later in life. Recently, there have been effective interventions to delay the onset of myopia, such as outdoor activity and decreasing the duration of near work. Hyperopia (<=0.5 diopters) is a predictor of myopia. Pharmacological agents and optic interventions such as low-concentration atropine and orthokeratology may slow progression in myopic children. Novel surgeries and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs could deal with some myopic complications. From available evidence, the prevention, control, and treatment of myopia seem to be promising. However, to reduce the impact of myopia in future decades, more work and effort are still needed, including that by governments and intercountry eye health organizations.

N2  - PURPOSE: A low concentration of macular carotenoid pigment (lutein and zeaxanthin) is a significant risk factor for macular degeneration. The goal of this paper is to investigate the relationship between macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and lacquer cracks (LC) in high myopia., METHODS: This is a prospective comparative observational study (NCT02205632) including high myopic patients with or without LC. High myopia was defined as a refractive error greater than 6 diopters of myopia or axial length greater than 26mm. All patients underwent best-corrected visual acuity in logMAR, MPOD measurement, multicolor imaging, SD-OCT, autofluorescence and axial length measurement. MPOD was calculated using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Group 1 was defined as eyes without LC and group 2 as eyes with LC., RESULTS: Forty-five eyes of 32 patients with a mean age of 51.3 years were included in group 1, and 15 eyes of 13 patients aged 54.1 in group 2 (P=0.56). Mean spherical equivalent was -10.11 diopters in group 1 and -15.11 in group 2 (P=0.0004). Mean visual acuity was +0.08 logMAR (0.8 in decimal notation) in group 1 and +0.11 logMAR (0.8 in decimal notation) in group 2 (P=0.061). Axial length was 27.8mm in group 1 and 29.2 in group 2 (P=0.0052). Central macular thickness was lower in group 1 (295mum) than in group 2 (305mum) (P<0.0001), and macular choroidal thickness did not differ between the two groups (P=0.094). Mean MPOD in group 2 was 0.52 and 0.63 in group 1 (P=0.042). Differences in axial length were not related to MPOD measurements (P=0.74)., CONCLUSION: A lower rate of MPOD was observed in cases of LC in high myopia. Further studies are needed to investigate if dietary carotenoids could have a protective effect in reducing the risk of LC. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: The pathophysiologic pathways that govern the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) are complex. Patchy atrophy and lacquer cracks are known to be major anatomic risk factors for the development of myopic CNV, but they are not alone and much remains to be understood about other factors that influence development. In addition, a greater understanding of the modifiable and nonmodifiable factors that influence outcome, resolution, and recurrence after intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could lead to more personalized treatment algorithms that integrate parameters other than the presence of CNV itself and could help improve clinical outcomes and reduce recurrence., METHODS: We reviewed recently published data on risk factors for CNV and predictors of response to anti-VEGF treatments. In particular, data pertaining to age, sex, genetic predisposition, baseline visual acuity, axial length, staphyloma, lacquer cracks, atrophic lesions, choroidal thickness or choroidal thinning, characteristics of CNV such as duration, localization, and size of CNV, and treatment considerations such as choice of treatment, loading doses, and combination treatments were reviewed., RESULTS: Our analysis showed that the body of evidence is incomplete., CONCLUSIONS: Additional studies are required to identify high-risk patients and to develop personalized therapeutic approaches.

N2  - Myopia is a major cause of visual impairment worldwide. In particular, high myopia is associated with serious blinding complications, including retinal detachment, chorioretinal degeneration, and choroidal neovascularization. Myopia is multifactorial in etiology, resulting from the interaction of environmental and genetic risk factors. During the past 2 decades, a large number of gene loci and variants have been identified for myopia. There are more than 20 myopia-associated loci spanning all chromosomes. Earlier findings were obtained mainly from family linkage analyses and candidate gene studies, and more recent results are principally from genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing. Some genetic associations have been successfully validated and replicated in populations of different geographic localities and ethnicities, but some have not. Compared with Whites, Asian populations-in particular Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-have a much higher prevalence of myopia, especially high myopia. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to such ethnic variations. This review attempts to summarize and compare the allelic frequencies of gene variants known to be associated with myopia in different ethnic groups, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Myopia-related maculopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. The prevalence of myopia has been reported as high as 90 % in some Asian countries. Therefore, controlling myopia progression is an urgent public issue. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of topical atropine with different concentrations on intraocular pressure measurements and myopia progression in school-aged children in Taiwan., METHODS: Fifty-six myopic children were divided into three groups: 32 children were treated with 0.125 % atropine eyedrop; 12 of them were treated with 0.25 % atropine eye drop and another 12 served as a control group. IOP, auto-refractor and manifest refraction were measured at baseline and every 3 months following treatment for one year., RESULTS: There were no significant differences for the mean age, gender and baseline IOPs among the three groups. During the follow up period, no significant IOP difference was found among three groups. The change between final and baseline mean IOPs also revealed no significant differences: 0.54 mmHg, -1.28 mmHg, -0.33 mmHg for the 0.125 % atropine, 0.25 % atropine and control groups. The baseline mean spherical equivalent similarly did not differ significantly among groups but the control group showed a significant myopic progression compared to the 0.125 % atropine group 6 months after treatment, and persisted for one year. The change between final and baseline mean spherical equivalents were -0.05 D, 0 D, -1.05 D for the 0.125 % atropine, 0.25 % atropine and control groups, with both atropine-treated groups showing significant myopic retardation compared to the control group., CONCLUSIONS: Topical use of low concentration atropine for one year does not induce ocular hypertension and is effective for retarding myopic progression. However, further large scale studies with longer follow up period is necessary to validate the long term safety and efficacy., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN33002849 , 2016/01/19, retrospectively registered.

N2  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the preoperative factors and postoperative outcomes following intraocular lens (IOL) exchange for high myopia in pseudophakic children. Methods The medical records of all patients undergoing IOL exchange for high myopia were retrospectively reviewed. Results A total of 15 eyes were identified that had undergone an IOL exchange for myopic shift. Average age of cataract extraction (CE) was 5.4 months. In all, 10/15 had a unilateral cataract. IOL exchange usually occurred at an average of 6 years following cataract surgery. The average spherical equivalent (SE) of the refractive error at that time was -9.6 D. Following IOL exchange, SE was -1.3 D. A two-line reduction in best-corrected visual acuity was observed in 1/13 of our patients for whom pre- and post-exchange data were available. The average axial length (AL) of the eye undergoing the IOL exchange was 24.0 mm, average AL in the non-operative eye was 22.1 mm. On average, the operative eyes grew 4.4 mm and the non-operative eyes 3.02 mm. No adverse events were seen in the operative eyes. Conclusion Younger age at the time of CE creates a greater likelihood of AL elongation and predisposes a child to myopic shift. IOL exchange should be considered an option to reduce anisometropia and associated aniseikonia to improve visual outcomes. Successful visual rehabilitation and predictable post-exchange refractions were seen with our patients.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the etiology, clinical features, and outcome of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in children., METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 10 eyes of 8 patients younger than 18 years diagnosed with CNV. The main clinical parameters included predisposing ocular pathologies, best-corrected visual acuity before and after treatment, characteristics of CNV, and treatment modalities., RESULTS: Two boys and 6 girls with CNV and a mean age of 13.9 years (SD 1.9, range 11-16 years) were included. Two patients developed bilateral CNV within the follow-up time. The development of CNV was secondary to the following pathologies: choroidal osteoma (n = 3), pathologic myopia (n = 1), punctate inner choroidopathy (n = 1), hereditary macular dystrophy (n = 2), and angioid streaks (n = 1). Idiopathic CNV was diagnosed in 2 children without any obvious associated ocular pathology. In 9 eyes, CNV was treated by intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) administration (n = 6), photodynamic therapy (n = 1), or combination therapy (n = 3). One eye remained untreated because of advanced disease., CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric CNV is a rare but sight-threatening retinal disease. So far, no standard treatment has been validated. Since the establishment of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, laser coagulation and photodynamic therapy have lost their significance as therapy for CNV.

N2  - PURPOSE: To analyze the morphologic features of peripapillary staphylomas associated with high myopia by swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT)., DESIGN: Validity analysis., METHODS: Highly myopic patients (refractive error >8.0 diopters or axial length >26.5 mm) with a peripapillary staphyloma who had undergone swept-source OCT were studied. The non-highly myopic fellow eyes in patients with unilateral high myopia were also studied. The presence of a peripapillary staphyloma was determined by stereoscopic ophthalmoscopic examinations. The OCT features of the peripapillary staphylomas and other peripapillary lesions were evaluated., RESULTS: Twenty-five eyes of 16 patients were studied. Twenty-two eyes were highly myopic and the remaining 3 eyes of the patients with unilateral high myopia were non-highly myopic. A peripapillary staphyloma was seen in the swept-source OCT images as a gently sloping excavation around the optic disc in all 25 eyes. The posterior sclera in the area of a peripapillary staphyloma was observed to bow posteriorly, with the local curvature steeper than the curvature of the adjacent scleral regions. The sclera at the edge of a peripapillary staphyloma appeared to be elevated inward from the surrounding sclera, and the choroid at the staphyloma edge appeared to be compressed and thinned. A peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation was a frequent complication and was found in 13 eyes with a peripapillary staphyloma (52.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: Swept-source OCT can detect the slight changes of the sclera and choroid in the area of a peripapillary staphyloma, and we recommend its use in determining the presence of a peripapillary staphyloma.

N2  - PURPOSE: The range of subretinal hyperreflective material (SHRM) seen in macular disease includes type 2 macular neovascularization, fibrosis, exudation, vitelliform material, and hemorrhage. The prognostic significance of SHRM has been evaluated retrospectively in clinical trials, but discriminating SHRM subtypes traditionally requires multiple imaging modalities. The purpose of this study is to describe optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) flow characteristics and artifacts that might help to distinguish SHRM subtypes., DESIGN: Validity analysis., METHODS: Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), myopia, pachychoroid disease, and macular dystrophy, manifesting SHRM on optical coherence tomography (OCT), were recruited. Clinical chart review and multimodal imaging established the SHRM subtype. All patients underwent OCTA. OCT and OCTA images were examined together for (1) intrinsic flow, (2) retinal projection onto the anterior SHRM surface (strong, weak, absent), (3) retinal projection through SHRM onto retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and (4) masking of choriocapillaris flow., RESULTS: Thirty-three eyes of 25 patients were included (type 2 neovascularization x3; fibrosis x4; exudation x10; hemorrhage x5; vitelliform x17). Mean age per eye was 76 years (standard deviation: 12). Intrinsic flow was strongest in type 2 neovascularization. Subretinal fibrosis showed limited flow in residual large-caliber vessels and branches. Flow was not detected within foci of exudation, hemorrhage, or vitelliform lesions. Retina-SHRM surface projection was strongest onto smooth-surfaced SHRM and weaker onto exudation. Retinal projection was weakest on the surface of vitelliform lesions. Retina-RPE projection was masked by dense hemorrhage and vitelliform material. In compound SHRM, OCTA distinguished between vascular and avascular components., CONCLUSION: Optical coherence tomography angiography can distinguish vascular from avascular SHRM components. OCTA artifacts may distinguish certain avascular SHRM components. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of high myopia (HM), progressive high (degenerative) myopia (PHM), and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) in the United States., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 18 years and older participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and patients aged 18 years and older seen in clinics participating in the American Academy of Ophthalmology's Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS( R)) Registry., METHODS: We analyzed NHANES data from 2005 to 2008 to determine the prevalence of HM in the United States. This prevalence was then applied to estimates from the US Population Census (2014) to arrive at a population burden of HM at the diopter level in the United States. Data from the IRIS Registry were used to calculate the real-world prevalence rates of PHM and mCNV among patients with HM at the diopter level. This was subsequently applied to this reference population with HM to calculate the diopter-adjusted prevalence and population burden of PHM and mCNV in the United States in 2014., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: High myopia was defined as myopic refractive error of <=6.0 diopters in the right eye. Progressive HM was defined as HM with the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code of "360.21: Progressive High (Degenerative) Myopia." Myopic CNV was defined as HM with the presence of subretinal/choroidal neovascularization indicated by the ICD-9-CM diagnosis of "362.16: Retinal Neovascularization NOS.", RESULTS: The estimated diopter-adjusted prevalence of HM, PHM, and mCNV was 3.92% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.82-5.60), 0.33% (95% CI, 0.21-0.55), and 0.017% (95% CI, 0.010-0.030), respectively, among adults in the United States aged 18 years and older in 2014. This translated into a population burden of approximately 9 614 719 adults with HM, 817 829 adults with PHM, and 41 111 adults with mCNV in the United States in 2014., CONCLUSIONS: Although HM and PHM impose a relatively large burden among adults in the United States, mCNV seems to be a rare disease. Relating data from the IRIS Registry and NHANES could be a novel method for assessing ophthalmic disease prevalence in the United States. Future studies should aim to better assess current treatment patterns and optimal management strategies of this condition. Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To analyze the refractive error in highly myopic eyes after cataract surgery and investigate the possible impact of fixation stability on it., DESIGN: Secondary data analysis from a previous prospective study., METHODS: Clinical data of 98 eyes of 98 consecutive patients with high myopia and 42 eyes of 42 controls, which underwent cataract surgery, were analyzed. Refractive error was calculated 1 month after surgery based on both Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff theoretic (SRK/T) and Holladay 1 formulas. Fixation stability was evaluated using the Macular Integrity Assessment microperimeter system, which assessed the fixation pattern in terms of 63% and 95% of the bivariate contour ellipse area (BCEA). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative refractive error., RESULTS: The highly myopic cataract group had greater hyperopic refractive errors (P < .001 for both formulas) and larger 63% and 95% BCEA values (P = .033 and P = .034) than the control group. In the highly myopic group, the factors 63% or 95% BCEA were positively correlated with the postoperative refractive error (SRK/T formula, r = 0.383, P < .001 and r = 0.320, P = .002, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that with the SRK/T formula, postoperative refractive error in highly myopic eyes was significantly correlated with axial length (beta = 0.491, P < .001), 63% BCEA (beta = 0.181, P = .045), and corneal curvature (beta = -0.190, P = .024). The refractive error was no longer associated with corneal curvature after using the Holladay 1 formula., CONCLUSIONS: Highly myopic eyes usually had hyperopic refractive errors after cataract surgery. Fixation stability might serve as an important determinant of postoperative refractive errors in this population. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To understand the long-term characteristics of visual field (VF) progression in myopic open-angle glaucoma (OAG) according to the morphology of optic disc tilt., DESIGN: Retrospective, comparative, longitudinal cohort study., METHODS: Myopic OAG eyes were divided into temporally tilted disc and inferiorly tilted disc groups according to optic disc torsional degrees. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare the survival rates between nonmyopic OAG, myopic OAG with temporally tilted disc, and myopic OAG with inferiorly tilted disc. The hazard ratio (HRs) for the associations between risk factors and progression were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. In the inferiorly tilted disc group, subgroups were classified into progression, stationary, and progression-to-stationary groups, and the clinical characteristics of VF progression were compared among the subgroups., RESULTS: A total of 82 eyes in 82 nonmyopic OAG patients and 150 eyes in 150 myopic OAG patients were included. Myopic OAG with inferiorly tilted disc showed significantly more baseline and final 1-hemifield-involvement cases compared with myopic OAG with temporally tilted disc (P < .001, P < .001, respectively). The cumulative probability of progression was shown to be faster for myopic OAG with inferiorly tilted disc compared with temporally tilted disc and nonmyopic OAG (P = .002, P = .038, respectively). A larger number of medications (HR = 1.339; P = .004), earlier-stage VF defect (HR = 1.217; P < .001), and inferiorly tilted disc (HR = 2.378; P < .001) were predictive of progression. In the analysis of myopic OAG with inferiorly tilted disc, the progression group had younger age and earlier-stage VF defect at baseline compared with the stationary group (P = .01, P < .001, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that VF progression in myopic OAG is associated with the morphology of the optic disc tilt. Especially in OAG with inferiorly tilted disc, VF is likely not to progress after terminating VF progression at the region associated with optic disc tilt. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the anatomical and visual outcomes by par plana vitrectomy with or without internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in highly myopic eyes with macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD)., METHODS: MEDLINE (Ovid, PubMed) and EMBASE were used for data collection up to September 30, 2015. The parameters of anatomical success, macular hole closure and improved best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at or beyond 6 months after operation were assessed as the primary outcome measurement. The meta-analysis was performed with the fixed-effects model., RESULTS: Seven comparative analyses involving a total of 373 patients were included in the present meta-analysis. Statistically the pooled data showed significant relative risk (RR) in terms of primary reattachment between ILM peeling and non-peeling groups (RR, 1.19; 95 % CI, 1.04 to 1.36; P = 0.012). An effect favoring ILM peeling with regard to macular hole closure was also detected (RR, 1.71; 95 % CI, 1.20 to 2.43; P = 0.003). However, no statistically significant difference was found in the improved BCVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) at 6 months or more (95 % CI, -0.31 to 0.44; P = 0.738)., CONCLUSIONS: There is no proved benefit of postoperative visual improvement. However, the available evidences from this study suggested a superiority of ILM peeling over no peeling for myopic patients with MHRD.

N2  - To investigate the morphological characteristics of myopic macular retinoschisis (MRS) in teenagers with high myopia, six male (9 eyes) and 3 female (4 eyes) teenagers with typical MRS identified from chart review were evaluated. All cases underwent complete ophthalmic examinations including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), indirect ophthalmoscopy, colour fundus photography, B-type ultrasonography, axial length measurement, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The average age was 17.8 +/- 1.5 years, average refractive error was -17.04 +/- 3.04D, average BCVA was 0.43 +/- 0.61, and average axial length was 30.42 +/- 1.71 mm. Myopic macular degenerative changes (MDC) by colour fundus photographs revealed Ohno-Matsui Category 1 in 4 eyes, and Category 2 in 9 eyes. Posterior staphyloma was found in 9 eyes. SD-OCT showed outer MRS in all 13 eyes, internal limiting membrane detachment in 7 eyes, vascular microfolds in 2 eyes, and inner MRS in 1 eye. No premacular structures such as macular epiretinal membrane or partially detached posterior hyaloids were found. Our results showed that MRS rarely occurred in highly myopic teenagers, and was not accompanied by premacular structures, severe MDC, or even obvious posterior staphyloma. This finding indicates that posterior scleral expansion is probably the main cause of MRS.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the impact of ethnicity, age, and ocular characteristics on ranibizumab efficacy in myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)., METHODS: In this post hoc subgroup analysis from the phase III RADIANCE study, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) outcomes and treatment exposure were analyzed in 105 patients treated with ranibizumab 0.5 mg. Baseline categories included ethnicity, age, baseline BCVA, lesion area, CNV lesion area, refraction sphere, axial length, subretinal fluid, and location of CNV., RESULTS: At month 12, the mean change in BCVA was numerically higher in East-Asians than in Caucasians (17.0 vs. 14.1 letters). The median number of injections varied with ethnicity (East-Asians vs. Caucasians: 2 vs. 3), baseline BCVA (highest vs. lowest: 1 vs. 4), CNV lesion area and lesion area (largest vs. smallest: 5 vs. 1 and 5 vs. 2)., CONCLUSIONS: East-Asians showed numerically higher BCVA gains than Caucasians. The number of injections varied across subgroups, emphasizing the need for individualized treatment. Copyright © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Knobloch syndrome is a rare, recessively inherited disorder classically characterized by high myopia, retinal detachment, and occipital encephalocele, but it is now known to have an increasingly variable phenotype. There is a lack of reported electrophysiologic data, and some key clinical features have yet to be described., OBJECTIVE: To expand on current clinical, electrophysiologic, and molecular genetic findings in Knobloch syndrome., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Twelve patients from 7 families underwent full ophthalmic examination and retinal imaging. Further investigations included electroretinography and neuroradiologic imaging. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of COL18A1 was performed with segregation on available relatives. The study was conducted from July 4, 2013, to October 5, 2015. Data analysis was performed from May 20, 2014, to November 3, 2015., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Results of ophthalmic and neuroradiologic assessment and sequence analysis of COL18A1., RESULTS: Of the 12 patients (6 males; mean age at last review, 16 years [range, 2-38 years]), all had high myopia in at least 1 eye and severely reduced vision. A sibling pair had unilateral high myopia in their right eyes and near emmetropia in their left eyes from infancy. Anterior segment abnormalities included absent iris crypts, iris transillumination, lens subluxation, and cataract. Two patients with iris transillumination had glaucoma. Fundus characteristics included abnormal collapsed vitreous, macular atrophy, and a tesselated fundus. Five patients had previous retinal detachment. Electroretinography revealed a cone-rod pattern of dysfunction in 8 patients, was severely reduced or undetectable in 2 patients, and demonstrated cone-rod dysfunction in 1 eye with undetectable responses in the other eye in 2 patients. Radiologic imaging demonstrated occipital encephalocele or meningocele in 3 patients, occipital skull defects in 4 patients, minor occipital changes in 2 patients, and no abnormalities in 2 patients. Cutaneous scalp changes were present in 5 patients. Systemic associations were identified in 8 patients, including learning difficulties, epilepsy, and congenital renal abnormalities. Biallelic mutations including 2 likely novel mutations in COL18A1, were identified in 6 families that were consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance with a single mutation identified in a family with 2 affected children., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This report describes new features in patients with Knobloch syndrome, including pigment dispersion syndrome and glaucoma as well as cone-rod dysfunction on electroretinography. Two patients had normal neuroradiologic findings, emphasizing that some affected individuals have isolated ocular disease. Awareness of the ocular phenotype may aid early diagnosis, appropriate genetic counseling, and monitoring for potential complications.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the influence of choroidal thickness (CT) on visual acuity (VA) in young persons with extremely high myopia., METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of young men with extremely high myopia and controls with emmetropia recruited from a mandatory medical eye review for employment purposes. Retinal and choroidal imaging was performed using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)., RESULTS: We included 105 extremely high myopic subjects with spherical equivalent (SE) -10 dioptre (D) or worse and 50 emmetropic subjects with SE less than 0.5 D. The mean SE was -11.56 +/- 2.04 D (range, -10 to -23 D) for myopic group and 0.14 +/- 0.25 D for emmetropic group. The mean age of included myopic and emmetropic subjects was 21.51 +/- 1.22 years and 21.96 +/- 0.89 years, respectively. In the univariate analysis, subfoveal CT was significantly associated with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (beta = -0.039, p = 0.015). However, in the multiple linear regression analysis, after adjusting for SE and presence of any pathological myopia lesions such as posterior staphyloma, lacquer cracks or chorioretinal atrophy, subfoveal CT was not independently associated with BCVA (p = 0.937)., CONCLUSION: Extremely high myopic eyes had thinner choroid, but CT was not an independent predictor of VA. Other factors related to myopia are likely responsible for the diminished VA in young extremely high myopic eyes. Copyright © 2016 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the incidence and risk factors of subretinal fibrosis and their impact on visual outcome in eyes with myopic CNV., METHODS: Medical records of 72 eyes treated with antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy in a pro re nata regimen for myopic CNV that followed up for more than 1 year were retrospectively reviewed. The presence of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy was determined using both fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography. The incidence and risk factors of subretinal fibrosis were evaluated, and best-corrected visual acuity was compared between the eyes with and without subretinal fibrosis., RESULTS: The incidences of subretinal fibrosis during the 1-year and whole follow-up period were 31.9% and 36.1%, respectively. Occurrence of subretinal fibrosis was associated with frequent CNV recurrence (P = 0.005) and poor baseline best-corrected visual acuity (P = 0.044) in a Cox proportional hazard model. Anatomically, the eyes with subretinal fibrosis showed more frequent progression of chorioretinal atrophy (95.7% vs. 71.4%, P = 0.027) and less frequent photoreceptor recovery (17.4% vs. 65.3%, P < 0.001) after anti-VEGF therapy. Occurrence of subretinal fibrosis was associated with poor vision at baseline (P = 0.011) and the final visit (P = 0.008) when compared with the findings in the nonoccurrence group., CONCLUSION: Development of subretinal fibrosis after anti-VEGF therapy was common in eyes with myopic CNV and was associated with CNV recurrence. Myopic eyes with subretinal fibrosis show progressive chorioretinal atrophy and poor visual outcome.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - The natural course of high-axial myopia is variable and the development of pathologic myopia is not fully understood. Advancements in optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology have revealed peculiar intraocular structures in highly myopic eyes and unprecedented pathologies that cause visual impairment. New OCT findings include posterior precortical vitreous pocket and precursor stages of posterior vitreous detachment; peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation; morphological patterns of scleral inner curvature and dome-shaped macula. Swept source OCT is capable of imaging deeper layers in the posterior pole for investigation of optic nerve pits, stretched and thinned lamina cribrosa, elongated dural attachment at posterior scleral canal, and enlargement of retrobulbar subarachnoid spaces. This has therefore enabled further evaluation of various visual field defects in high myopia and the pathogenesis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. OCT has many potential clinical uses in managing visual impairing conditions in pathologic myopia. Understanding how retinal nerve fibers are redistributed in axial elongation will allow the development of auto-segmentation software for diagnosis and monitoring progression of glaucoma. OCT is indispensable in the diagnosis of various conditions associated with myopic traction maculopathy and monitoring of post-surgical outcomes. In addition, OCT is commonly used in the multimodal imaging assessment of myopic choroidal neovascularization. Biometry and topography of the retinal layers and choroid will soon be validated for the classification of myopic maculopathy for utilization in epidemiological studies as well as clinical trials.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the role of SCO2 in extreme myopia of Japanese patients., METHODS: In total, 101 Japanese patients with extreme myopia (axial length of >=30 mm) OU at the Kyoto University Hospital were included in this study. Exon 2 of SCO2 was sequenced by conventional Sanger sequencing. The detected variants were assessed using in silico prediction programs: SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and MutationTaster. To determine the frequency of the mutations in normal subjects, we referred to the 1000 Genomes Project data and the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD) in the Human Genetic Variation Browser., RESULTS: The average age of the participants was 62.9 +/- 12.7 years. There were 31 males (30.7 %) and 70 females. Axial lengths were 31.76 +/- 1.17 mm OD and 31.40 +/- 1.07 mm OS, and 176 eyes (87.6 %) out of 201 eyes had myopic maculopathy of grade 2 or more. Among the 101 extremely myopic patients, one mutation (c.290 C > T;p.Ala97Val) in SCO2 was detected. This mutation was not found in the 1000 Genomes Project data or HGVD data. Variant type of the mutation was nonsynonymous. Although the SIFT prediction score was 0.350, the PolyPhen-2 probability was 0.846, thus predicting its pathogenicity to be possibly damaging. MutationTaster PhyloP was 1.268, suggesting that the mutation is conserved., CONCLUSIONS: We identified one novel possibility of an extreme myopia-causing mutation in SCO2. No other disease-causing mutation was found in 101 extremely myopic Japanese patients, suggesting that SCO2 plays a limited role in Japanese extreme myopia. Further investigation is required for better understanding of extreme myopia.

N2  - AimsHigh myopia is a common visual disorder in the world. The ZNF644, GRM6, and CTNND2 genes are expressed in the retina. This study aims to investigate the associations of these genes with high myopia in Han Chinese population. Methods The case-control association included high myopia cases (n=430) and controls (n=430) recruited from a population-based study, 'Jiangsu Eye Study'. Fourteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes were genotyped by the TaqMan method using the real-time PCR system. Results Three SNPs GRM6-rs11746675, GRM6-rs2067011, and GRM6-rs2645339 were associated with high myopia (odds ratio (OR)=0.74, P=0.003; OR=0.78, P=0.018; and OR=0.78, P=0.023; respectively). The significances of rs2067011 and rs2645339 disappeared after multiple testing corrections. Rs11746675 remained significant after correction for multiple testing. The genetic model analysis found that GRM6-rs11746675 and GRM6-rs2067011 were suggestively associated with high myopia in the recessive model (OR=0.54, P=0.004; OR=0.52, P=0.003; respectively). Haplotype GAT for GRM6 markers rs2067011-rs2645339-rs762724 showed significance (P=0.0239), but such association did not remain significant after multiple testing corrections. Conclusions Our data suggested that genetic variants in GRM6 are associated with high myopia. The mechanism of GRM6 in the development of high myopia need to be further investigated.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the level of transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2) in the aqueous humor of highly myopic cataract patients and its correlation with capsule contraction syndrome., SETTING: Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China., DESIGN: Prospective comparative case series., METHODS: The highly myopic cataract patients were divided into the following 2 groups according to the Lens Opacity Classification System III: nuclear color (NC) 2 to 3 and NC 5 to 6. Aqueous humor TGF-beta2 concentrations were assayed in the highly myopic cataract and age-related cataract groups. The TGF-beta2, TGF-betaRII (the type II receptor for TGF-beta2), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expressions in lens epithelial cells (LECs) were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescent staining., RESULTS: The study comprised 40 highly myopic cataract patients (40 eyes) and 20 patients (20 eyes) with age-related cataract as the control group. Compared with the control group, the highly myopic cataract group had significantly higher TGF-beta2 concentration in the aqueous humor and increased TGF-betaRII expression in LECs, especially in NC 5 to 6 cases. Expression of alpha-SMA was barely detectable in both groups., CONCLUSION: In highly myopic cataract patients, especially those with dark nuclei, elevated aqueous humor TGF-beta2 levels and the upregulated TGF-betaRII expression in LECs might contribute to the pathogenesis of capsule contraction syndrome through transdifferentiation of LECs into myofibroblasts., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: None of the authors has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess whether optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) can be used as an alternative to conventional fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) for the detection of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)., DESIGN: Validity and reliability analysis., METHODS: Twenty-eight eyes of 26 consecutive Japanese patients with exudative lesions associated with pathologic myopia were included in this institutional study. Myopic CNV was detected in 23 eyes of 22 patients; 5 eyes exhibited simple hemorrhage. The main outcome measure was CNV detection by OCTA and FFA. The CNV area was individually measured by FFA and OCTA. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the CNV area, independently measured by 2 investigators using OCTA and FFA, were determined., RESULTS: OCTA images with sufficient quality for CNV assessment were obtained for 17 eyes with CNV and 4 without. FFA alone detected CNV in all 17 eyes, while OCTA alone detected CNV in 16 (94.1%). The 1 eye for which CNV was not detected by OCTA exhibited a 0.01 mm(2) area on FFA. Both FFA and OCTA did not detect CNV in eyes with simple hemorrhage. The mean CNV areas on FFA and OCTA were 0.59 +/- 0.56 mm(2) and 0.51 +/- 0.55 mm(2), respectively; the 2 values were significantly correlated (P < .001, r = .86). The ICC (2, 1) values for FFA and OCTA were 0.944 and 0.997, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that OCTA can detect most myopic CNVs if high-quality images are acquired and can preclude the requirement for FFA in these settings.

N2  - PURPOSE: Myopia is a common cause of vision loss, with uncorrected myopia the leading cause of distance vision impairment globally. Individual studies show variations in the prevalence of myopia and high myopia between regions and ethnic groups, and there continues to be uncertainty regarding increasing prevalence of myopia., DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis., METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of myopia and high myopia and estimated temporal trends from 2000 to 2050 using data published since 1995. The primary data were gathered into 5-year age groups from 0 to >=100, in urban or rural populations in each country, standardized to definitions of myopia of -0.50 diopter (D) or less and of high myopia of -5.00 D or less, projected to the year 2010, then meta-analyzed within Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions. Any urban or rural age group that lacked data in a GBD region took data from the most similar region. The prevalence data were combined with urbanization data and population data from United Nations Population Department (UNPD) to estimate the prevalence of myopia and high myopia in each country of the world. These estimates were combined with myopia change estimates over time derived from regression analysis of published evidence to project to each decade from 2000 through 2050., RESULTS: We included data from 145 studies covering 2.1 million participants. We estimated 1406 million people with myopia (22.9% of the world population; 95% confidence interval [CI], 932-1932 million [15.2%-31.5%]) and 163 million people with high myopia (2.7% of the world population; 95% CI, 86-387 million [1.4%-6.3%]) in 2000. We predict by 2050 there will be 4758 million people with myopia (49.8% of the world population; 3620-6056 million [95% CI, 43.4%-55.7%]) and 938 million people with high myopia (9.8% of the world population; 479-2104 million [95% CI, 5.7%-19.4%])., CONCLUSIONS: Myopia and high myopia estimates from 2000 to 2050 suggest significant increases in prevalences globally, with implications for planning services, including managing and preventing myopia-related ocular complications and vision loss among almost 1 billion people with high myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the 5-year efficacy of a foldable, hydrophobic, angle-supported phakic intraocular lens (pIOL) when used to correct moderate to high myopia., DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, open-label cohort study conducted in the United States, the European Union, and Canada (3 separate protocols)., PARTICIPANTS: This was a pooled analysis of 515 eyes from 360 patients 18 to 49 years of age with moderate to high myopia (preoperative corrected distance visual acuity [CDVA] <=0.34 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) and with variance in the manifest refraction spherical equivalent within +/-0.5 diopter (D) for a minimum of 12 months., INTERVENTION: Implantation of the AcrySof Cachet angle-supported anterior chamber pIOL (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), CDVA, predictability and stability of manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), serious adverse events, endothelial cell density, and patient satisfaction., RESULTS: Of 360 patients who received implantation in at least 1 eye (515 eyes), 326 (90.6%) completed the study (5-year best-corrected visual acuity data available for 415 eyes). At 5 years, a decrease in CDVA of 2 lines or more was observed in 0.5% of eyes (n = 2/415) compared with preoperative baseline. At 5 years, all 415 eyes achieved a CDVA of 0.34 logMAR or less; 91.3% (n = 379/415) had a CDVA of 0.04 logMAR or less. Mean UDVA +/- standard deviation (SD) was 0.01+/-0.18 logMAR; 94.7% (n = 393/415) and 66.3% (n = 275/415) of eyes had a UDVA of 0.34 logMAR or less or 0.04 logMAR or less, respectively, at 5 years. Mean MRSE +/- SD was -0.34+/-0.57 D (range,-2.50 to 1.63 D). Most eyes (89.8%; n = 371/413) had an MRSE within +/-1.00 D of their target refractive error at 5 years and 67.3% (n = 278/413) were within +/-0.50 D. Mean annualized central endothelial cell loss was 1.46% (90% confidence interval [CI], -1.6% to -1.3%) from 6 months to 5 years. The most common pIOL-related serious adverse event was adhesion between the cornea and the iris (synechia; n = 24). Most patients (98.1%) indicated that they would have the same pIOL implanted again., CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate to high myopia, the AcrySof Cachet angle-supported pIOL provided excellent refractive correction for up to 5 years after implantation, with a low rate of mean central endothelial cell loss. Careful patient selection is necessary to achieve optimal postsurgical outcomes. Copyright © 2016 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence, features, associated factors, and reproducibility of segmentation errors in macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness measurement as determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT)., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty-eight glaucomatous and healthy eyes from 290 subjects with OCT-measured macular GCIPL thickness were enrolled. Eyes with macular disorders, including epiretinal membrane, macular degeneration, macular hole, and myopic maculopathy, were excluded., METHODS: By inspecting 128 cross-sectional OCT B-scan images per eye, the presence (yes vs. no), layer (anterior vs. posterior border), location (quadrants), and area (diffuse vs. focal) of macular GCIPL segmentation error were investigated. The effects of age, refractive error, mean deviation of visual field test, circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness obtained by OCT, and signal strength of OCT scan on the presence of macular GCIPL segmentation errors were evaluated. In eyes with segmentation errors, repeated OCT examinations were performed to investigate the reproducibility of the segmentation errors., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The prevalence, features, associated factors, and reproducibility of macular GCIPL segmentation errors were assessed., RESULTS: Among the 538 eyes, 52 eyes (9.7%) showed segmentation errors in macular GCIPL thickness measurement. The most common features of segmentation errors were that they affected both the anterior and posterior borders, were located at the nasal quadrant (centered to the fovea), and were diffuse. In univariate analysis, the presence of segmentation error was associated significantly with younger age (P < 0.001), higher degree of myopia (P < 0.001), and lower signal strength of OCT scan (P = 0.038). In multivariate analysis, only higher degree of myopia was associated significantly with the presence of segmentation error (P < 0.001). In repeated examinations, segmentation errors were reproducible in 24 eyes (46.2%). In other cases, the features of segmentation errors changed or disappeared., CONCLUSIONS: Although the OCT segmentation algorithm accurately detected macular GCIPL thickness in most eyes without macular disorders, in some cases, segmentation errors were found, especially in myopic eyes. In repeated examinations, approximately half of the errors were nonreproducible. These findings should be considered when assessing macular GCIPL thickness using OCT.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of myopic maculopathy and specific optic disc and macular changes in highly myopic eyes of young Asian adults and their impact on visual acuity., DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study., METHODS: In total, 593 highly myopic (spherical equivalent refraction [SER] less than -6.00 diopters [D]) and 156 emmetropic (SER between -1.00 and +1.00 D) male participants from a population-based survey were included. All participants underwent standardized medical interviews, ophthalmic examination, and color fundus photographs. These photographs were graded systematically to determine the presence of optic disc and macular lesions. Myopic maculopathy was classified based on the International Classification of Myopic Maculopathy., RESULTS: The mean age was 21.1 +/- 1.2 years. The mean SER for the highly myopic and emmetropic group was -8.87 +/- 2.11 D and 0.40 +/- 0.39 D, respectively (P < .001). Compared to emmetropic eyes, highly myopic eyes were significantly more likely to have optic disc tilt, peripapillary atrophy (PPA), posterior staphyloma, chorioretinal atrophy, and myopic maculopathy (all P < .001). The main findings included PPA (98.3%), disc tilt (22.0%), posterior staphyloma (32.0%), and chorioretinal atrophy (8.3%). Myopic maculopathy was present in 8.3% of highly myopic eyes and was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.66; 95% CI: 1.22, 2.26), reduced choroidal thickness (OR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.99), and increased axial length (AL) (OR 1.52; 95% CI: 1.06, 2.19). The presence of disc tilt, posterior staphyloma, and chorioretinal atrophy were associated with reduced visual acuity., CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that myopia-related changes of the optic disc and macula were common in highly myopic eyes even at a young age. The risk factors for myopic maculopathy include increased age, longer AL, and reduced choroidal thickness. Some of these changes were associated with reduced central visual function.

T1  - An examination of the relation between intraocular pressure, fundal stretching and myopic pathology.

N2  - Pathological myopia is one of the leading causes of visual impairment worldwide. Myopic development and progression is biomechanical and dominated by axial elongation. This clinical perspective examines some of the stretch-related fundal changes, which are associated with axial elongation and myopic pathology. The biomechanics of stretching of the fundus appears to depend on genetically and/or visual experience-based scleral changes, which reduce its thickness and elastic modulus so that it becomes more susceptible to the distending forces of intraocular pressure. These changes include reduced collagen synthesis, altered collagen fibres, tissue loss, altered proteoglycans and increased matrix metalloproteinase activity. Such changes are associated with reduced scleral rigidity and related increased potential to stretch in response to intraocular pressure. As axial elongation progresses, the sclera appears likely to continue to reduce in thickness and in its capacity to resist intraocular pressure, especially when pressure becomes elevated. Tessellation, lacquer cracks, myopic crescents, staphylomata, chorioretinal atrophy and retinal detachment are examined within a model for stretching of the fundus. Age, refractive error and axial length, for example, are associated with increased pathological progression. Myopic pathological progression can become dominated by vascular changes and include a greater risk of loss of acuity and blindness. Measures to control myopic pathology, which successfully slow or prevent stretching of the fundus, appear to be key factors in reducing or even avoiding permanent visual loss associated with this condition. For example, limiting axial elongation and related myopic fundus pathology by inhibiting changes which reduce the elastic modulus of scleral tissue is a desirable outcome from interventions to control myopia. Similarly, reducing exposure to the distending stress of elevated intraocular pressure appears to be a desirable form of intervention to control myopia, especially if myopic pathology can be reduced or prevented.

N2  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the rate of progression of total, upper, and lower visual field defects in patients with treated primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) with high myopia (HM)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy eyes of 70 POAG patients with HM [<=-8 diopters (D)] were examined. The mean deviation (MD) slope and the upper and lower total deviation (upper TD, lower TD) slopes of the Humphrey Field Analyzer were calculated in patients with high-tension glaucoma (HTG) (>21 mmHg) versus normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) (<=21 mmHg). The mean age of all the patients (29 eyes with HTG and 41 eyes with NTG) was 48.5 +/- 9.6 years. The MD slope, and upper and lower TD slopes of the HM group were compared to those of the non-HM group (NHM) (>-8 D) selected from 544 eyes in 325 age-matched POAG patients. In all, 70 eyes with HM and NHM were examined., RESULTS: The mean MD slope was -0.33 +/- 0.33 dB/year in the HM, and -0.38 +/- 0.49 dB/year in the NHM. There were no statistical differences between the HM and NHM (p = 0.9565). In the comparison of HTG versus NTG patients in both groups, the MD slope, and upper and lower TD slopes were similar., CONCLUSIONS: The rate of progression of total, upper, and lower visual field defects was similar among patients with HM and NHM. Although HM is a risk factor for the onset of glaucoma, HM may not be a risk factor for progression of visual field defects as assessed by the progression rate under treatment.

N2  - AIM: To compare treatment outcomes for myopic choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) managed with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (vPDT), intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF, bevacizumab/ranibizumab) agents or combination thereof., METHODS: Clinical data of 79 eyes with myopic CNV examined from March 2004 to July 2013 was retrospectively reviewed. Patients were managed with vPDT, intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 mL)/ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 mL) or a combination of vPDT and anti-VEGF. Outcome measures included complete regression (scarring) of CNV and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)., RESULTS: Treatments provided were vPDT (n=23), anti-VEGF (n=25) (ranibizumab, n=12; bevacizumab, n=13), vPDT+anti-VEGF (n=31). Mean logMAR BCVA changed from 0.59+/-0.44 to 0.49+/-0.40 at mean follow-up of 54.63+/-39.46 months. Mean logMAR vision changed from 0.68+/-0.57, 0.54+/-0.48 and 0.59+/-0.39 at presentation to 0.59+/-0.53, 0.38+/-0.44 and 0.37+/-0.37 at last follow-up in PDT (p=0.4), anti-VEGF (p=0.1) and vPDT+anti-VEGF groups (p=0.0002), respectively. CNV was scarred in 64 eyes (81%) at mean 11.03+/-13.56 months. Most common complication was macular scar (n=64), associated with reduced (n=17) or preserved (n=47) vision. Chorioretinal atrophy attributable to vPDT was seen in five eyes (vPDT, n=3; vPDT+anti-VEGF, n=2)., CONCLUSION: Combination of vPDT and intravitreal anti-VEGF (ranibizumab/bevacizumab) was associated with better visual outcomes and higher rates of regression in eyes with myopic CNV as compared with monotherapy with PDT or anti-VEGF. Larger size of CNV, and high refractive error were independent risk factors for poor visual outcomes. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - Complications from pathologic myopia are a major cause of visual impairment and blindness, especially in east Asia. The eyes with pathologic myopia may develop loss of the best-corrected vision due to various pathologies in the macula, peripheral retina and the optic nerve. Despite its importance, the definition of pathologic myopia has been inconsistent. The refractive error or axial length alone often does not adequately reflect the 'pathologic myopia'. Posterior staphyloma, which is a hallmark lesion of pathologic myopia, can occur also in non-highly myopic eyes. Recently a revised classification system for myopic maculopathy has been proposed to standardize the definition among epidemiological studies. In this META-PM (meta analyses of pathologic myopia) study classification, pathologic myopia was defined as the eyes having chorioretinal atrophy equal to or more severe than diffuse atrophy. In addition, the advent of new imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and three dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MRI) has enabled the detailed observation of various pathologies specific to pathologic myopia. New therapeutic approaches including intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents and the advance of vitreoretinal surgeries have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with pathologic myopia. The purpose of this review article is to provide an update on topics related to the field of pathologic myopia, and to outline the remaining issues which need to be solved in the future.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic abilities of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT; Spectralis OCT) and time-domain OCT (TD-OCT; Stratus OCT). Changes in macular parameters in highly myopic eyes of glaucoma patients and highly myopic eyes of glaucoma suspects were evaluated and compared., METHODS: We collected data from 72 highly myopic eyes (spherical equivalent, <=-6.0D). Forty-one eyes had perimetric glaucoma and 31 eyes were suspected to have glaucoma (control group). All eyes underwent SD-OCT and TD-OCT imaging. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and sensitivity were examined on macular volume and thickness parameters at a fixed specificity and compared between groups., RESULTS: The highest TD-OCT AUROC curves were found using outer inferior sector macular thickness (AUROC curve, 0.911) and volume (AUROC curve, 0.909). The highest SD-OCT AUROC curves were found using outer inferior region thickness (AUROC curve, 0.836) and volume (AUROC curve, 0.834). The difference between the two imaging modalities was not statistically significant (thickness, p = 0.141; volume, p = 0.138). The sensitivity of TD-OCT macular outer inferior average thickness was highest and was 88.2%, with a specificity of 80.4%. The sensitivity of TD-OCT average volume measurements in this same region was 76.5%, with a specificity of 91.3%. The SD-OCT average thickness measurements also had the highest sensitivity in this region, which was 78.6%, with a specificity of 82.1%. The SD-OCT volume measurements had a sensitivity of 67.9%, with a specificity of 92.3%., CONCLUSIONS: Both SD-OCT and TD-OCT measurements of outer inferior macular thickness and volume can differentiate between eyes of glaucoma patients and glaucoma suspects with high myopia. These independent predictors all had good sensitivity. Based on our results, SD-OCT and TD-OCT have similar diagnostic abilities. These parameters may provide useful additional data in highly myopic eyes to complement standard glaucoma diagnosis tools.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between the microstructure of beta-zone peripapillary atrophy (PPA) and the subsequent visual field (VF) progression in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), including highly myopic eyes., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 129 patients with POAG who had been followed up for a minimum of 2 years and had undergone at least 5 reliable standard automated perimetry tests after spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) examination., METHODS: beta-Zone PPA was evaluated from 3 SD OCT scans centered on the optic disc. Upper and lower scans were defined as scans at 30degree above and below the horizontal scan, respectively. From 3 scans of each eye, beta-zone PPA was classified as PPA(+BM) or PPA(-BM) on the basis of the presence or absence of Bruch's membrane (BM), respectively. Eyes were classified into 3 groups according to the horizontal scan images: group A (only PPA(+BM)), group B (both PPA(+BM) and PPA(-BM)), and group C (only PPA(-BM)). Factors associated with the subsequent mean deviation (MD) slope after OCT examination were analyzed, and the hemifield total deviation (TD) slope was assessed in eyes with unilateral hemifield VF defects in the corresponding direction., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subsequent MD slope after OCT examination., RESULTS: The VF progression in group A was faster than in group C (P = 0.004). A larger PPA(+BM) width was associated with a faster MD slope in all eyes (P < 0.001) and highly myopic eyes (P < 0.001) and with a faster TD slope in eyes with superior or inferior hemifield VF defects in the corresponding direction (P = 0.002 and P = 0.035, respectively). A larger PPA(-BM) was correlated with a slower MD slope in all eyes (P = 0.030 and P = 0.034) but not in highly myopic eyes., CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in VF progression according to the microstructure of the beta-zone PPA in eyes with POAG. The PPA(+BM) width may be an important risk factor for VF progression in POAG, including high myopia, and the PPA(-BM) width may have a protective effect for VF progression in this subtype of POAG.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The global prevalence of pathologic myopia is 0.9-3.1%, and visual impairment is found in 0.1-0.5% of European and 0.2-1.4% of Asian studies. Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) affects 5.2-11.3% of pathologic myopia patients and is a leading cause of vision impairment in the working-age population. Characteristic morphological changes and visual-acuity decrease are diagnostic features. Vascular-Endothelial-Growth-Factor (VEGF) has been identified as a trigger for pathologic neovascularization in these highly myopic patients., AREAS COVERED: We cover the epidemiology, pathology and diagnostic aspects of mCNV. The history of therapeutic interventions is described, followed by an overview of current standard-of-care (SOC)-blocking VEGF using bevacizumab (off-label), ranibizumab or aflibercept and improving vision up to 13.5-14.4 letters. Despite good efficacy, an unmet medical need remains. We summarize ongoing and future developments of new drugs to treat or potentially cure mCNV., EXPERT OPINION: mCNV is a major global health concern. Early detection and treatment is key for a satisfying outcome. The current SOC, VEGF inhibitors, affords good therapeutic efficacy and reasonable disease stabilization with few intravitreal treatments per year. However, the long-term prognosis is still unsatisfactory, and side-effects like chorioretinal atrophy development are of concern. Therefore, efforts should be intensified to develop more effective therapies.

N2  - AIMS: To evaluate the characteristics of the posterior segments of eyes with high myopia and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) and identify which ocular factors are most associated with scleral thickness and posterior staphyloma height., METHODS: The study included 45 patients with highly myopic NTG and 38 controls with highly myopic eyes (<=-6D or axial length >=26.0 mm). The subfoveal retinal, choroidal, scleral thickness and the posterior staphyloma heights were examined from enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and compared between two groups., RESULTS: Highly myopic NTG eyes had thinner subfoveal scleral thickness (473.03+/-43.75 vs 579.46+/-75.87 microm, p<0.001) and higher posterior staphyloma (97.80+/-70.10 vs 62.83+/-32.01 microm, p=0.027) than highly myopic, non-glaucomatous eyes. Subfoveal scleral thickness was significantly correlated with age, axial length, corneal hysteresis and the posterior staphyloma height of the superior quadrant, the nasal quadrant and the arithmetic mean of four quadrants in highly myopic NTG eyes. Corneal hysteresis (beta=2.694, p=0.015), corneal resistance factor (beta=-2.916, p=0.010) and the posterior staphyloma height of the nasal quadrant (beta=-0.463, p=0.017) were significantly associated with the subfoveal scleral thickness in highly myopic NTG eyes., CONCLUSION: Subfoveal scleral thinning and non-uniform posterior staphyloma were closely related in highly myopic NTG eyes. Corneal hysteresis, corneal resistance factor and the nasal posterior staphyloma height were associated with the scleral thickness. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine frequency and associations of macular Bruch membrane defects in the region of macular atrophy developing after the onset of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)., DESIGN: Retrospective observational case series., METHODS: The study included all patients who were consecutively examined for high myopia (axial length >=26.5mm) and CNV-related macular atrophy in the study period from June to July 2015. The patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination including swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula. Main outcome measures were macular Bruch membrane defects., RESULTS: Out of 33 eyes (28 patients) with myopic CNV-related macular atrophy, 25 eyes (76%) showed macular Bruch membrane defects, which were characterized by a lack of Bruch membrane, retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors, and choriocapillaris. At the edges of the macular Bruch membrane defects, the ends of the Bruch membrane were upturned, and an inward protrusion of large choroidal vessels could be detected. In the center of macular Bruch membrane defects, remnants of Bruch membrane could be crumpled. In multivariate analysis, higher prevalence of secondary macular Bruch membrane defects was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of intravitreal medical therapy (P < .001) after adjusting for larger macular atrophy area size (P < .001) and longer interval between development of the CNV and final examination (P = .42)., CONCLUSIONS: Macular Bruch membrane defects belong to the hallmarks of myopic CNV-related macular atrophy. Since macular Bruch membrane defects lack photoreceptors and thus represent psychophysically an absolute scotoma, they are of profound importance for visual prognosis. As incidentally observed at study end, the prevalence of macular Bruch membrane defects may be lower if a previous myopic CNV was treated by intravitreal medical therapy.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the surgical outcomes of inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) insertion in macular hole (MH)-associated retinal detachment (RD) in high myopia., DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series., METHODS: This study was conducted at 2 medical centers. Consecutive cases of highly myopic eyes with MH-associated RD were included. Forty eyes were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (20 eyes) received vitrectomy, ILM peeling within the arcade area, and air-fluid exchange, and Group 2 (20 eyes) received vitrectomy, inverted ILM inserted into the macular hole, and air-fluid exchange. Optical coherence tomography was used to observe the closure of the macular hole. Corrected visual acuity (VA) was also recorded. Two-sample t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis to compare differences between the 2 groups., RESULTS: MH was closed in 35% of the eyes in Group 1 and in all eyes in Group 2 (P < .001). Significant improvement in VA in logarithm of minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) was achieved in both groups. There was no difference in the initial, final, or improvement of logMAR VA in the 2 groups., CONCLUSION: Inverted ILM insertion into a macular hole effectively helps close the macular hole in MH-associated RD in high myopia. This may prevent the possible re-detachment from the MH. A prospective study with a larger number of cases and longer follow-up may help validate our findings. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the aetiology, clinical features, and surgical outcomes of paediatric rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD) in Hong Kong. Patients and methods This is a retrospective consecutive case series of all patients aged 18 or under who underwent primary retinal detachment repair in the Hong Kong Eye Hospital from January 2000 to December 2012. Results Forty-nine eyes of 47 patients were included. The mean age was 14, and the mean follow-up duration was 6.2 years. The most common aetiology for RRD was idiopathic (28.6%), followed by high myopia (24.5%), atopic dermatitis (AD) (18.4%), congenital and developmental abnormalities (16.3%), trauma (8.2%), and intraocular inflammation (4.1%). The mean preoperative visual acuity was LogMAR 1.0+/-0.8 (Snellen equivalent 6/60). The primary anatomical success rate in this series was 65.3%, and the final anatomical success rate was 85.7%. The mean postoperative visual acuity was LogMAR 0.9+/-1.2 (Snellen equivalent 6/48). Patients with congenital and developmental abnormalities or AD had worse anatomical and functional outcomes than patients who had no predisposing factor or high myopia., CONCLUSIONS: The primary and overall anatomical success rates in our series were comparable with existing literature. High myopia is the most commonly identifiable risk factor in Hong Kong and AD is associated with a higher re-detachment rates and a poor visual outcome.

N2  - AIMS: A previous genome-wide association study of high myopia identified five genome-wide loci for ocular axial length (C3orf26, ZC3H11B, RSPO1, GJD2, and ZNRF3). The aim of our study was to investigate the association between high myopia and genetic variants in the five loci in Han Chinese subjects., METHODS: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 296 unrelated high-myopia subjects and 300 matched emmetropic controls by the SNaPshot method. The distribution of genotypes in the cases and controls was compared in codominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models by using SNPStats online software., RESULTS: Significant associations between rs994767 near ZC3H11B (p = 0.001), rs4074961 in RSPO1 (p < 0.001), and rs11073058 in GJD2 (p = 0.029) and high myopia were observed. Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.532 (1.200-1.955), 1.603 (1.267-2.029), and 1.290 (1.027-1.621) for the rs994767 T allele, rs4074961 T allele, and rs11073058 T allele, respectively. But rs9811920 in C3orf26 and rs12321 in ZNRF3 were not associated with high myopia., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that genetic variants in ZC3H11B, RSPO1, and GJD2 are associated with susceptibility to the development of high myopia in a Han Chinese population. Functional roles of ZC3H11B, RSPO1, and GJD2 in the pathology of high myopia need to be further investigated. Copyright © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This article aims to review recent advances in the understanding of epidemiology and risk factors for the development of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and highlight the diagnostic features of myopic CNV and signs seen on the noninvasive optical coherence tomography technology, which may be particularly useful for the purpose of screening. Choroidal neovascularization is a sight-threatening complication of pathologic myopia. Because myopic CNV frequently affects individuals during their working life, its socioeconomic impact is significant, especially in Asian countries where the prevalence of pathologic myopia is high., EPIDEMIOLOGY: Pathological myopia is the most common cause of CNV in patients less than 50 years old, and it is estimated that 5.2% to 11.3% of individuals with pathologic myopia develop myopic CNV., RISK FACTORS: The risk of developing myopic CNV increases with the severity of myopia and macular changes, such as diffuse atrophy, lacquer cracks, and patchy atrophy, which progress to myopic CNV in a significant proportion. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may contribute to the development of myopic CNV., NATURAL COURSE AND PROGNOSIS: Untreated myopic CNV carries a poor visual prognosis, with an estimated 89% of the patients having marked visual impairment within 5 years of onset., TREATMENT: Anti-VEGF therapy is efficacious in treating myopic CNV. Although this significantly improves the short-term prognosis of myopic CNV, the long-term visual loss due to the sequela of myopic CNV including macular atrophy and scarring remains.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe microstructural changes and schisis extent in eyes with myopic retinoschisis and to determine their influence on visual acuity at baseline and follow-up., METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 50 eyes of 38 patients with myopic retinoschisis were evaluated using spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and the patients were followed for at least 12 months. The presence of microstructural changes and the extent of retinoschisis at baseline on spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and the association between these parameters and the risk of visual acuity deterioration were analyzed., RESULTS: Median presenting visual acuity and central retinal thickness were 0.31 logMAR (=20/40) and 395 mum, respectively. Twenty-six eyes (52%) had entire macular area retinoschisis. Common microstructural changes included photoreceptor detachment (24%), foveal ellipsoid zone (EZ) disruption (34%), partial-thickness macular hole (26%), and full-thickness macular hole (16%). Visual acuity was poorer in eyes with photoreceptor detachment, EZ disruption, full-thickness macular hole, and central retinal thickness >300 mum. Eyes with entire macular area retinoschisis had the poorest visual acuity and thickest central retinal thickness, and they were more likely to have photoreceptor detachment, EZ disruption, and retinal detachment. Over a mean follow-up of 31.7 +/- 7.7 months, 14 eyes (28%) had worsening visual acuity of >=2 lines. Ten of these 14 eyes had entire macular retinoschisis at baseline., CONCLUSION: Most eyes with myopic retinoschisis remain stable. However, eyes with extensive retinoschisis involving the entire macular area are more likely to progress and have microstructural abnormalities and poorer vision. Early surgery should be considered for these eyes.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate outcomes of photorefractive keratectomy up to -10.00 D of myopia and -4.50 of astigmatism and to develop a predictive model for the refractive changes in the long term., SETTING: Vissum Corporation and Miguel Hernandez University (Alicante, Spain)., DESIGN: Retrospective-prospective observational series of cases., METHODS: This study included 33 eyes of 33 patients aged 46.79+/-7.04 years (range 40-57) operated with the VISX 20/20 excimer laser with optical zones of 6 mm. No mitomycin C was used in any of these cases. The minimum follow-up was 15 years. The main outcome measures were: uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, manifest refraction and corneal topography. Linear regression models were developed from the observed refractive changes over time., RESULTS: Safety and efficacy indexes at 15 years were 1.18 and 0.83, respectively. No statistically significant differences were detected for any keratometric variable during the follow-up (p>=0.103). 15 years after the surgery 54.55% of the eyes were within +/-1.00 D of spherical equivalent and 84.85% within +/-2.00 D. The uncorrected distance visual acuity at 15 years was 20/25 or better in 60.6% of the eyes and 20/40 or better in 72.73% of the eyes. The correlation between the attempted and the achieved refractions was r=0.948 (p<0.001) at 1 year, and r=0.821 (p<0.001) at 15 years. No corneal ectasia was detected in any case during the follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Photorefractive keratectomy is a safe refractive procedure in the long term within the range of myopia currently considered suitable for its use, although its efficacy decreases with time, especially, in high myopia. The model developed predicts a myopic regression of 2.00 D at 15 years for an ablation depth of 130 microm. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To compare the rates of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thinning in subgroups of patients with glaucoma based on spherical equivalent (SE)., METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients were classified into three subgroups, namely, non-myopic glaucoma (NMG, >0 dioptres (D)), mild-to-moderate glaucoma (MMG, 0 to -6 D) and highly myopic glaucoma (HMG,<-6 D), according to their SE. Linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate the rate of change of RNFL thickness determined by spectral domain optical coherence tomography, adjusting for potentially confounding factors., RESULTS: Among 231 glaucomatous eyes from 231 patients (mean followed up 4.5 years), 105 (45.5%) were classified as NMG, 100 (43.2%) as MMG and 26 (11.3%) as HMG. Baseline visual field mean deviation did not differ among the three subgroups (-4.15 vs -5.44 dB vs -4.38 dB, p=0.185). Thinning rate of average RNFL did not differ among the three subgroups (-0.58, -0.52 and -0.54 mum/year, p=0.931). However, RNFL thinning rate at temporal quadrant (-0.85 vs -0.23 mum/year, p=0.046) and eight o'clock sector was greater in the HMG than in the NMG subgroups (-1.72 vs -0.35 mum/year, p=0.003), while that of one o'clock sector was greater in the NMG than in the HMG subgroups (-0.93 vs 0.45 mum/year, p=0.009)., CONCLUSION: Overall rate of RNFL thinning was not different among the glaucoma subgroups based on refractive error. However, sectoral RNFL thinning showed significant difference. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - PURPOSE: To report the clinical results of lens capsular flap transplantation in refractory macular hole (MH)., METHODS: This retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series included 20 eyes with persistent MH after previous standard MH surgery. All eyes underwent vitrectomy, lens anterior or posterior capsule transplantation into the MH, gas tamponade, and a 1-week postoperative head down. Structural and functional changes were evaluated., RESULTS: The predisposing conditions to surgical failure included high myopia with MH and retinal detachment in four eyes, MH after myopic foveoschisis surgery in one eye, high myopia with a large MH in one eye, proliferative diabetic retinopathy with MH in three eyes, MH with severe retinal detachment in one eye, retinal detachment with concurrent peripheral breaks and MH in one eye, and large or chronic MH in nine eyes. Macular hole was closed in all the 10 eyes receiving anterior capsular flap transplantation. In the 10 eyes with posterior capsular flap transplantation, MH was closed in 5, partially closed in 3, and not closed in 2. Visual acuity in logarithm of minimal angle of resolution improved from 1.53 +/- 0.39 preoperatively to 1.07 +/- 0.35 postoperatively., CONCLUSION: Lens capsular flap transplantation may close the MH and improve visual outcome in the majority cases of refractory MH.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the morphologic alterations on spectral domain optical coherence tomography in active myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) receiving intravitreal bevacizumab and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy, taking fluorescein angiography as a reference examination., METHODS: Thirty patients (30 eyes) were prospectively enrolled. Each eye was imaged with fluorescein angiography and spectral domain optical coherence tomography at the baseline and at 1-, 2-, and 3-month examinations. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography parameters consisting of intraretinal/subretinal fluid and absence of external limiting membrane (ELM) visibility were considered signs of CNV activity and collated with the presence/absence of leakage on fluorescein angiography. Main outcome measures were frequencies of the retinal alterations associated with myopic CNV at the diagnosis and during monitoring of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy., RESULTS: At the diagnosis, spectral domain optical coherence tomography identified subretinal fluid in 14 eyes (46%), intraretinal fluid associated with subretinal fluid in 12 eyes (40%), and absence of ELM visibility in 30 of the 30 eyes (100%). During the follow-up, fluorescein leakage was noted in 32 visits (18, 8, and 6 eyes at the 1-, 2- and 3-month examinations, respectively). Taking into consideration spectral domain optical coherence tomography features of active myopic CNVs on fluorescein angiography, subretinal fluid was identified in 24 examinations (75%), intraretinal cysts with subretinal fluid were noted in 5 visits (15.6%), and the absence of ELM visibility was visible in 32 examinations (100%). The alterations of the ELM corresponded to the location of the fluorescein leakage., CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the absence of ELM visibility is a more reliable parameter for evaluating CNV activity than intraretinal/subretinal fluid collection and may constitute a useful option in diagnosing and monitoring the myopic CNV during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the vitreoretinal relationship in eyes with full-thickness macular hole (FTMH) without retinal schisis or detachment. Eyes with and without high myopia were compared using slit-lamp biomicroscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and intraoperative observations., METHODS: Clinical records of 34 consecutive cases of FTMH without schisis or detachment in highly myopic eyes (refractive error larger than -6.0 diopters or axial length >26 mm) were retrospectively reviewed. All eyes underwent pars plana vitrectomy between 2006 and 2013. An additional 43 consecutive cases of FTMH in eyes without high myopia were also reviewed to serve as controls. All control patients underwent surgery during the same period. Ophthalmological, OCT, and intraoperative findings, and vitreoretinal interface features were documented in both groups. Anatomical closure rate and final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were compared between groups., RESULTS: Premacular tissue was identified during surgery in 21 of 34 high myopia patients (61.8 %) and three of 43 control patients (7.0 %). The high myopia group showed two layers of premacular membranes. Two cases had a shiny, loose inner membrane, 13 cases had a tightly adherent outer membrane, and six cases had both. Only a tightly adherent membrane was found in controls. In the high myopia group, 11 of 21 eyes (52.4 %) did not have a preretinal membrane identified preoperatively. Anatomical closure was achieved in 91.2 and 95.3 % of high myopia and control patients respectively (p = 0.65). No significant intergroup difference in final BCVA was observed., CONCLUSION: Premacular tissue was found in 61.8 % of eyes with high myopia and FTMH without retinal schisis or detachment. Anatomically successful surgical closure in high myopia patients was achieved at a rate comparable to their idiopathic counterparts.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to systematically review the evidence for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in choroidal neovascularisation secondary to conditions other than age-related macular degeneration., DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, MEDLINE in-process, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases and conference abstracts were searched (from inception to Jan 2014)., STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Randomised and non-randomised comparative studies with follow-up of at least 6 months were included and were used to assess clinical effectiveness., STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHOD: Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was not possible due to methodological heterogeneity., RESULTS: 16 studies met the inclusion criteria (1091 eyes; 963 pathological myopia, 74 other conditions). There was large variation in risk of bias across studies. An improvement in best-corrected visual acuity in anti-VEGF arms over comparators was reported in all studies. The proportion of patients improving by at least 15 letters in anti-VEGF arms ranged from 27.3% to 70%. There were no significant differences between bevacizumab and ranibizumab., LIMITATIONS: Owing to the rarity of choroidal neovascularisation secondary to conditions other than age-related macular degeneration or pathological myopia, there are unlikely to ever be sufficiently powered trials in these populations., CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab and ranibizumab appear to be effective in improving visual acuity for patients with choroidal neovascularisation secondary to conditions other than age-related macular degeneration. The evidence base is strongest for choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathological myopia, however, based on current evidence and likely pharmacological pathways, clinicians should consider treatment with either bevacizumab or ranibizumab for rarer causes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) is a rare, generalized connective tissue disorder associated with extreme corneal thinning and a high risk of corneal rupture. Recessive mutations in transcription factors ZNF469 and PRDM5 cause BCS. Both transcription factors are suggested to act on a common pathway regulating extracellular matrix genes, particularly fibrillar collagens. We identified bilateral myopic choroidal neovascularization as the presenting feature of BCS in a 26-year-old-woman carrying a novel PRDM5 mutation (p.Glu134*). We performed immunohistochemistry of anterior and posterior segment ocular tissues, as expression of PRDM5 in the eye has not been described, or the effects of PRDM5-associated disease on the retina, particularly the extracellular matrix composition of Bruch's membrane., METHODS: Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against PRDM5, collagens type I, III, and IV was performed on the eyes of two unaffected controls and two patients (both with DELTA9-14 PRDM5). Expression of collagens, integrins, tenascin and fibronectin in skin fibroblasts of a BCS patient with a novel p.Glu134* PRDM5 mutation was assessed using immunofluorescence., RESULTS: PRDM5 is expressed in the corneal epithelium and retina. We observe reduced expression of major components of Bruch's membrane in the eyes of two BCS patients with a PRDM5 DELTA9-14 mutation. Immunofluorescence performed on skin fibroblasts from a patient with p.Glu134* confirms the generalized nature of extracellular matrix abnormalities in BCS., CONCLUSIONS: PDRM5-related disease is known to affect the cornea, skin and joints. Here we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that PRDM5 localizes not only in the human cornea, but is also widely expressed in the retina. Our findings suggest that ECM abnormalities in PRDM5-associated disease are more widespread than previously reported.

N2  - UNLABELLED: Introduction: The aim of the study was to study the eye corneoscleral shell and connective tissue (CT) system in children with acquired and congenital progressive myopia, and to identify the informative diagnostic criteria of weakened supporting function of the sclera., MATERIAL AND METHODS: 155 children aged 9-17 were examined: 18 had emmetropia or hyperopia, 20--low, 32--moderate and 85--high myopia. 32 children had complicated myopia (CM) due to peripheral retinal degeneration (PRD). Corneal hysteresis (CH), scleral acoustic density (SAD), X-ray vertebral topography, plantography, joint hypermobility, serum cortisol (SC), and autonomic balance were measured., RESULTS: Corneal hysteresis, mmHg and SAD, rel. units (mean +/- SE) were lower if myopia was higher: in low myopia, CH was 13.0 +/- 0.3, in moderate myopia, 11.9 +/- 0.3#, in high myopia, 10.7 +/- 0.3#; SAD was resp. 215.9 +/- 5.2, 204.9 +/- 3.7# and 192.8 +/- 5.8# (#: p < 0.05 with regard to low myopia). The lowest CH (10.3 +/- 0.4) and SAD (186.5 +/- 7.3) were found in acquired CM. Congenital myopia with PRD showed CH and SAD greater than in acquired CM (p < 0.05). Serum cortisol (nmol/L) in hyperopia was 335.8 +/- 40.9 and dropped with higher myopia: in low myopia--290.7 +/- 58.6, in moderate--250.9 +/- 26.4, in high--243.9 +/- 20.5. The lowest SC was found in acquired CM, consistent with CH and SAD. Connective tissue dysplasia progressed with higher myopia: it was found in 76.9% of children with low, 82.4% with moderate, 89.2% with high acquired myopia, and 91.7% with congenital myopia. Biomechanical defects of CT and hormonal imbalance were combined with vegetative nervous system (VNS) imbalance: in high myopia only 20.5% of children were eutonic, 61.5%--sympathicotonic and 17.5% parasympathicotonic., CONCLUSIONS: School age children with progressive myopia showed biomechanical abnormalities of the corneosclera, along with CT dysplasia, decreased SC and imbalanced VNS, more pronounced in acquired complicated myopia. Our findings contribute to the understanding of myopia pathogenesis and to the diagnostic/prognostic evaluation of myopic children, in particular when deciding whether sclera-strengthening intervention is needed.

N2  - In this paper, we present a multiple ocular diseases detection scheme based on joint sparse multi-task learning. Glaucoma, Pathological Myopia (PM), and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) are three major causes of vision impairment and blindness worldwide. The proposed joint sparse multitask learning framework aims to reconstruct a test fundus image with multiple features from as few training subjects as possible. The linear version of this problem could be casted into a multi-task joint covariate selection model, which can be very efficiently optimized via kernelizable accelerated proximal gradient method. Extensive experiments are conducted in order to validate the proposed framework on the SiMES dataset. From the Area Under Curve (AUC) results in multiple ocular diseases classification, our method is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms.

N2  - PURPOSE: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal disease with high genetic heterogeneity and variable phenotypes. Characteristic symptoms include night blindness and progressive loss of visual field, leading to blindness. Mutations in >60 genes have been identified to date as causative for RP, and additional candidate genes are assumed., METHODS: To find the disease-causing mutations in the affected members of five Turkish families, we sequenced whole exomes using an Illumina platform., RESULTS: Among all candidate genes for retinal degeneration we found two previously known sequence variations: a 4 bp deletion in the RPGR gene (c.1662_1665delAGAA; p.Glu555Glyfs*14) and a recently described USH1-causing missense mutation in MYO7A (c.472G>A, p.Gly158Arg). Furthermore, a novel 1 bp deletion in the VCAN gene (c.5118delA; p.Ser1707Valfs*44) was detected as well as a large deletion in EYS, spanning ~ 400kb and comprising exons 16-26 (p.fs*). In one family, exome analyses of two affected individuals revealed a homozygous missense mutation (c.883G>A; p.Asp295Asn) in the AGBL5 (Agbl5; CCP5) gene, previously not reported to be associated with RP. RNA and protein analyses showed expression in human retina, as well as in mouse retina, brain and testis. Furthermore, cDNA analyses indicate the existence of tissue-specific AGBL5 splice variations in humans. AGBL5/CCP5 immunoreactivity was also visualized in human and mouse retinae., CONCLUSION: Due to the characteristic RP phenotype in patients carrying the AGBL5 missense mutation we suggest this gene as a candidate for a new form of autosomal recessively inherited RP and recommend further investigation to confirm this hypothesis.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the incidence and characteristics of retinal complications following implantation of two types of phakic intraocular lenses (PIOLs) in patients with myopia., METHODS: In this comparative, retrospective study, 603 eyes of 344 patients with myopia underwent implantation of either an Artisan iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens IOL (Artisan; Ophtec, Groningen, Netherlands) (Artisan group) or a Visian implantable collamer lens (ICL; STAAR Surgical Company, Monrovia, CA) (ICL group) between June 2005 and December 2013. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative clinical data were collected on the incidence of retinal complications, including rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) or choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM)., RESULTS: The Artisan lens was implanted in 185 (30.68%) eyes and 418 (69.32%) eyes underwent ICL implantation. Mean follow-up was 26.78 months (range: 9 days to 98 months). Mean preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -12.44 +/- 4.43 D (range: -1.13 to -31.00 D). The overall rate of retinal complications was 1%. Postoperatively, 3 (0.7%) eyes developed RRD in the ICL group, and no eyes developed RRD in the Artisan group. Submacular hemorrhage was observed in 1 (0.24%) eye in the ICL group. Two (1%) eyes developed CNVM in the Artisan group. The mean time from PIOL implantation to retinal complications was 15.6 months (range: 0.03 to 43 months)., CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of ICL or Artisan phakic IOL demonstrated comparable rates of retinal complications. Anterior chamber PIOL does not increase the risk of retinal detachment or CNVM in patients with myopia. Copyright 2015, SLACK Incorporated.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate refractive and visual outcomes of wavefront-guided laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) to correct high myopia using a new Hartmann-Shack aberrometer., SETTING: Optical Express, Glasgow, United Kingdom., DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series., METHODS: Data of eyes that had wavefront-guided LASIK for high myopia and myopic astigmatism (spherical equivalent [SE] between -6.00 diopters [D] and -10.25 D, up to 5.00 D of cylinder) were analyzed. The treatment profile was derived from a new-generation Hartmann-Shack aberrometer (iDesign Advanced Wavescan). Visual acuities, refractive outcomes, vector analysis of refractive cylinder, and patient satisfaction were assessed. Three-months data are presented., RESULTS: Data were obtained for 621 eyes. The mean manifest SE reduced from -7.28 D +/- 1.05 (SD) (range -10.25 to -6.00 D) preoperatively to -0.09 +/- 0.44 D (range -2.13 to +1.38 D) at 3 months. The mean manifest cylinder changed from -1.02 +/- 0.82 D (range -5.00 to 0.00 D) to -0.27 +/- 0.33 D (range -1.75 to 0.00 D) postoperatively. The percentage of eyes achieving an uncorrected distance visual acuity 20/20 or better was 82.4% monocularly and 92.5% binocularly. The mean correction ratio of refractive cylinder was 1.02 +/- 0.48, and the mean error of angle was -0.29 +/- 14.56 degrees. A postoperative questionnaire revealed high satisfaction with the outcomes of the procedure, with low scores for night-vision phenomena., CONCLUSION: The results in this study were promising in terms of safety, efficacy, and predictability in eyes with high degrees of myopia., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: Dr. Schallhorn is a consultant to Abbott Medical Optics, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Retinal detachment (RD) secondary to macular hole (MH) is a common complication in highly myopic eyes, usually leading to a poor visual prognosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surgical outcome of silicone oil (SO) tamponade and internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in the treatment of RD caused by MH (MHRD) in highly myopic eyes with chorioretinal atrophy, and to identify clinical factors associated with the anatomical outcomes., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 21 eyes of 21 highly myopic patients affected by RD secondary to MH and chorioretinal atrophy. All eyes were treated with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with ILM peeling and SO tamponade. Anatomical success was defined as reattachment of the retina with the closure of the MH, as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), after SO removal. Logistic regression was performed to determine the clinical factors influencing anatomical success., RESULTS: The mean patient age was 59.95 years [standard deviation (SD), 10.39; range, 34-77 years] and the mean axial length was 30.58 mm (SD, 1.52; range, 27.99-34.51 mm). After the first surgical procedure, the anatomical success rate was 61.9% (13 eyes in 21 eyes), with initial retinal attachment of 16 eyes (76.2%). A second surgical approach was performed for the five eyes with persistent or recurrent RD, and the final retinal reattachment rate was 100% (21/21). Logistic regression analysis showed that no specific factors were significantly associated with anatomical success., CONCLUSIONS: Primary silicone oil tamponade and ILM peeling can be a practical treatment for repairing MHRD in highly myopic eyes with chorioretinal atrophy.

N2  - Myopia is a significant public health problem worldwide, particularly in East Asian countries. The increasing prevalence of myopia poses a huge socio-economic burden and progressive high myopia can lead to sight-threatening ocular complications. Hence, the prevention of early-onset myopia progressing to pathological high myopia is important. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that increased outdoor time is an important modifiable environmental factor that protects young children from myopia. This protective effect may be due to high light intensity outdoors, the chromaticity of daylight or increased vitamin D levels. This review summarises the possible underlying biological mechanisms for the protective association between time outdoors and myopia, including the potential role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in refractive error development. Recent evidence for the role of other environmental risk factors such as near work, birth seasons, parental smoking and birth order are also summarised. Copyright © 2015 Optometry Australia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) changes following intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy and to identify clinical and choroidal parameters associated with visual outcome in eyes with myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)., METHODS: In 60 eyes of 54 patients who were treated with anti-VEGF injections for myopic CNV, SFCT was measured using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography at baseline, at 1, 3, and 6 months after initial anti-VEGF therapy, and at the final visit. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was compared between visits in subgroups separated based on anatomic outcome, recurrence, or resolution. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)., RESULTS: At baseline, the mean SFCT was 47.6 +/- 24.7 mum, significantly lower than that of the contralateral eyes (59.8 +/- 34.4 mum, P = 0.022). The thickness significantly decreased to 45.2 +/- 24.0 mum (P = 0.027) 1 month after the anti-VEGF therapy. In the recurrent cases, the SFCT significantly increased from 46.1 +/- 25.5 mum at month 1 to 52.4 +/- 25.8 mum at the time of recurrence (P = 0.020); however, no significant change in the SFCT was noted in the nonrecurrent cases. In the regression analyses, the baseline BCVA (P < 0.001) and central macular thickness (CMT; P = 0.003) significantly correlated with the final BCVA, whereas SFCT or its change was not significantly associated with final BCVA., CONCLUSIONS: Subfoveal choroidal thicknesss significantly decreased following anti-VEGF therapy in myopic CNV, but showed a subsequent increase in recurrence. Subfoveal choroidal thickness may reflect disease activity and aid decision making regarding retreatment in myopic CNV for recurrent cases.

N2  - Macular degenerations represent leading causes of central blindness or low vision in developed countries. Most of these severe visual disabilities are due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and pathologic myopia (PM), both of which are frequently complicated by subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT-V) is still employed for CNV treatment in selected cases or in combined regimen. In Caucasian patients, the common polymorphism G185T of factor XIII-A gene (FXIII-A-G185T; rs5985) has been described as predictor of poor angiographic CNV responsiveness to PDT-V. Nevertheless, the prognostic implications of this pharmacogenetic determinant on long-term visual outcome after a PDT-V regimen have not been evaluated. We retrospectively selected Caucasian patients presenting with treatment-naive CNV and receiving standardized PDT-V protocol for two years. The study population included patients affected by subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD or PM. We assessed the correlations between the polymorphic allele T of FXIII-A-G185T and: (1) total number of photodynamic treatments; and (2) change in visual acuity from baseline to the end of the follow-up period. Considering a total study population of 412 patients with neovascular AMD or PM, the carriers of 185 T-allele of FXIII-A (GT or TT genotype) received a higher number of photodynamic treatments than patients without it (GG wild-type genotype) (p < 0.01; mean number of PDT-V: 5.51 vs. 3.76, respectively). Moreover, patients with 185 T-allele of FXIII-A had a more marked worsening of visual acuity at 24 months than those with the GG-185 wild genotype (p < 0.01; mean difference in logMAR visual acuity: 0.22 vs. 0.08, respectively). The present findings show that the G185T polymorphism of the FXIII-A gene is associated with significant differences in the long-term therapeutic outcomes of patients treated with standardized PDT-V protocol. The comprehensive appraisal of both anti-thrombophilic effects due to FXIII-A G185T variant and photo-thrombotic action of PDT-V toward CNV provides several clues about the rationale of this intriguing pharmacogenetic correlation. Further investigations are warranted to outline the appropriate paradigm for guiding PDT-V utilization in the course of the combined therapeutic protocol for neovascular macular degeneration.

N2  - PURPOSE: Excessive axial elongation of the eye in high myopia can cause biomechanical stretching leading to various ocular complications. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on various pathologic changes, especially in the chorio-retina and sclera that have been reported recently using advanced ophthalmic bio-imaging modalities such as optical coherence tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and fundus photography., RECENT FINDINGS: The prevalence rates of pathologic myopia (myopic retinopathy and maculopathy) mirror the prevalence rates of high myopia as the risks of pathologic myopia increase with high myopia. Peripapillary and sub-foveal choroidal thinning, scleral thinning, and deformed/irregular eye shapes were found to be strongly associated with various pathologic myopic lesions, especially with posterior staphyloma and chorio-retinal atrophy. Considering the increasing prevalence rate of myopia and pathologic myopia, these degenerative changes are likely to increase dramatically over the next few decades due to the rapid growth in the number of individuals with high myopia and the ageing population., SUMMARY: The current prevalence rates of pathologic myopia in older adults might have significantly underestimated the future prevalence rates and warrants age of onset of myopia being considered a major risk factor for pathologic myopia. Using advanced technology, identification of novel quantifiable chorio-retinal and scleral parameters in pathologic myopia would help to identify people at risk of developing pathologic myopia and potentially may revolutionise the management of myopia especially in risk prognostication and monitoring of disease progression.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and refractive and keratometric stability of myopic femtosecond laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) with concurrent prophylactic high-fluence corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) compared with the outcomes of standard femtosecond LASIK., SETTING: Private clinical practice, Athens, Greece., DESIGN: Consecutive randomized prospective comparative study., METHODS: Eyes that had myopic LASIK or myopic LASIK with concurrent high-fluence CXL were evaluated preoperatively and up to 2 years postoperatively for manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), refractive astigmatism, visual acuity, corneal keratometry (K), and endothelial cell count., RESULTS: One hundred forty consecutive eyes had myopic LASIK; 65 of the eyes were treated additionally with CXL. In the LASIK-CXL eyes, the mean postoperative MRSE was -0.18 diopter (D) +/- 17.0 (SD) from -6.67 +/- 2.14 D preoperatively. The postoperative flat K was 37.67 D from 43.92 D, and the steep K was 38.38 D from 45.15 D. The correlation coefficient of SE correction predictability was 0.975. In the LASIK-only eyes, the mean postoperative MRSE was -0.32 +/- 0.24 D from -5.49 +/- 1.99 D preoperatively. The flat K was 38.04 D from 43.15 D, and the steep K was 38.69 D from 44.03 D. The correlation coefficient of SE correction predictability was 0.968. The differences between the 2 groups at the 20/20 and 20/25 levels were statistically significant (P = .045 and P = .039, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Two-year results indicate that the application of prophylactic CXL concurrently with high-myopic LASIK appears to improve refractive and keratometric stability, presumably by affecting corneal biomechanical properties., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: Dr. Kanellopoulos is a consultant to Alcon Surgical, Inc., Wavelight Laser Technologie AG, Allergan, Inc., Avedro, Inc., and i-Optics Corp.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recently it was suggested that high myopia macular holes (HMMH) and macular holes accompanied by retinal detachment occur in the advanced stages of myopia traction maculopathy (MTM), while macular retinoschisis, shallow retinal detachment without holes, and lamellar macular holes occur in the early stages of MTM. Complete vitreous cortex removal associated with internal limiting membrane peeling is now widely used to treat HMMH. However, it remains uncertain at what HMMH stage patients would benefit most from surgical intervention. Our study was aimed to evaluate the postoperative anatomical changes and functional outcomes of high myopia macular holes (HMMH)., METHODS: Patients were retrospectively collected between March 2009 and August 2011. Before and 1st, 3rd, and 9th month after 23G pars plana vitrectomy, all patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and MP-1. At each follow-up, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), photoreceptor inner and outer segments (IS/OS) defects, and retinal sensitivity (RS) were investigated. According to different preoperative macular hole morphologies, patients were divided into three groups: Group 1, macular hole with epiretinal membrane (ERM) traction and macular retinoschisis; Group 2, full-thickness macular hole (FTMH); Group 3, FTMH with subretinal fluid., RESULTS: 43 eyes from 43 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60 years. BCVA and RS were significantly improved after vitrectomy; the mean IS/OS defect was significantly reduced. At 9 postoperative months, 11 of 43 (25.6 %) eyes achieved IS/OS junction integrity; 9 of these 11 (81.8 %) eyes belonged to Group 1, 2 (18.2 %) belonged to Group 2., CONCLUSIONS: Pars plana vitrectomy combined with ILM peeling and gas tamponade results in limited functional outcomes in patients with HMMH. The appearance of subretinal fluid indicates a worse prognosis for surgical intervention.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term refractive and visual stability and the risks related to the implantation of Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL; STAAR Surgical, Monrovia, CA) phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) for myopia., METHODS: This retrospective, consecutive, cumulative clinical study was performed in a group of 144 eyes implanted with ICL PIOL for myopia. Only the cases with clinical data available 12 years after the implantation were included in the series. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected distance visual acuity, spherical equivalent, refractive astigmatism, endothelial cell density, ICL vaulting, and postoperative complications were analyzed., RESULTS: Mean spherical equivalent refraction was -16.90+/-4.26 diopters (D) preoperatively and -1.77+/-1.93 D 12 years postoperatively. Mean CDVA at the first and last visit were 0.31+/-0.19 logMAR and 0.22+/-0.22 logMAR, respectively (Mann-Whitney U test, P<.001). Twelve years postoperatively, 8.9% of eyes had lost more than two lines of CDVA. The incidence of clinically relevant cataracts (13.88%) was significantly linked to the use of the V3 model ICL (chi-square test, P=.007). During the follow-up period, a significant reduction in PIOL vaulting was observed (Kruskal-Wallis test, P<.05), and the mean endothelial cell density decreased by 19.75%., CONCLUSIONS: The ICL PIOL provided good refractive outcomes and stability in the long term. The incidence of cataracts is low when the latest models of this PIOL are used. Copyright 2015, SLACK Incorporated.

N2  - Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia has a very high incidence in global, especially in Asian, populations. It is a common cause of irreversible central vision loss, and severely affects the quality of life in the patients with pathologic myopia. The traditional therapeutic modalities for CNV secondary to pathologic myopia include thermal laser photocoagulation, surgical management, transpupillary thermotherapy, and photodynamic therapy with verteporfin. However, the long-term outcomes of these modalities are disappointing. Recently, intravitreal administration of anti-VEGF biological agents, including bevacizumab, ranibizumab, pegaptanib, aflibercept, and conbercept, has demonstrated promising outcomes for this ocular disease. The anti-VEGF regimens are more effective on improving visual acuity, reducing central fundus thickness and central retina thickness than the traditional modalities. These anti-VEGF agents thus hold the potential to become the first-line medicine for treatment of CNV secondary to pathologic myopia. This review follows the trend of "from bench to bedside", initially discussing the pathogenesis of myopic CNV, delineating the molecular structures and mechanisms of action of the currently available anti-VEGF drugs, and then systematically comparing the up to date clinical applications as well as the efficacy and safety of the anti-VEGF drugs to the CNV secondary to pathologic myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To study the effect of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy on subretinal hyperreflective exudation detected by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) in myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)., DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive observational cohort study., METHODS: Thirty-one eyes of 31 consecutive highly myopic patients with CNV and showing a subretinal hyperreflective exudation on SD OCT were included. Morphologic changes were assessed before and after anti-VEGF therapy, based on the subretinal hyperreflective exudation thickness, retinal thickness at the level of the CNV, and central macular thickness., RESULTS: After anti-VEGF treatment (mean follow-up of 1.9 +/- 0.8 months, mean number of injections 1.8 +/- 0.6), the subretinal hyperreflective exudation regressed completely in 29 of 31 eyes (93.5%) and partially in 2 of 31 eyes (6.5%). Mean subretinal hyperreflective exudation thickness, mean retinal thickness at the level of the CNV, and mean central macular thickness significantly decreased from 102 +/- 50 mum to 2.6 +/- 10.2 mum (P < .0001), from 419 +/- 99 mum to 312 +/- 64 mum (P < .0001), and from 361 +/- 69 mum to 326 +/- 72 mum (P = .0008), respectively., CONCLUSION: The subretinal hyperreflective exudation was an SD OCT finding that correlated with signs of active myopic CNV (either subretinal fluid/intraretinal cysts on SD OCT or dye leakage on fluorescein angiography) and responded to treatment with anti-VEGF agents. The presence of a subretinal hyperreflective exudation on SD OCT could help in making decisions on the need to perform or not perform fluorescein angiography, and regarding treatment or retreatment.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the anatomical and functional outcomes in a cohort of subjects undergoing vitrectomy for myopic foveoschisis, and to analyse the factors predicting foveal reattachment and visual improvement., METHODS: This retrospective case series evaluated case records and optical coherence tomography images 6 months after surgery. Multivariate linear and logistic regressions were performed to assess the factors predicting anatomical and visual improvement., RESULTS: In total, 55 eyes of 54 patients were analysed. The mean spherical equivalent refraction was -11.83+/-4.94D. Foveal detachment was present in 63.5% of eyes preoperatively and subjects with foveal detachment had 0.70 logMAR units (95% CI 0.02 to 1.39) poorer visual acuity than subjects without (p=0.046). The mean preoperative visual acuity was 0.84+/-0.59 logMAR units and the mean postoperative visual acuity was 0.64+/-0.64 logMAR units (mean difference 0.20+/-0.68 logMAR units (p=0.04)). The proportion of eyes with foveal detachment was significantly lower after surgery (12.5%; p<0.001). However, the proportion of eyes with ellipsoid zone disruption was significantly higher after surgery (59.6% vs 34.0%; p<0.001). In multivariate analyses, the preoperative central foveal thickness significantly predicted postoperative visual improvement by two or more lines (OR 1.004 (95% CI 1.000 to 1.007), per mum increase; p=0.049). The presence of ellipsoid zone disruption preoperatively was associated with 0.96 logMAR (95% CI 0.2 to 1.72) poorer final acuity (p=0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with myopic foveoschisis with preoperative ellipsoid disruption and thinner central foveal thickness tend to have poorer visual outcomes. While current surgical manoeuvres are effective in reattaching the fovea, they may also cause iatrogenic injury to the photoreceptors. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

N2  - PURPOSE: MYP1 is a locus for X-linked syndromic and nonsyndromic high myopia. Recently, unique haplotypes in OPN1LW were found to be responsible for X-linked syndromic high myopia mapped to MYP1. The current study is to test if such variants in OPN1LW are also responsible for X-linked nonsyndromic high myopia mapped to MYP1., METHODS: The proband of the family previously mapped to MYP1 was initially analyzed using whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. Additional probands with early-onset high myopia were analyzed using whole-exome sequencing. Variants in OPN1LW were selected and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Long-range and second PCR were used to determine the haplotype and the first gene of the red-green gene array. Candidate variants were further validated in family members and controls., RESULTS: The unique LVAVA haplotype in OPN1LW was detected in the family with X-linked nonsyndromic high myopia mapped to MYP1. In addition, this haplotype and a novel frameshift mutation (c.617_620dup, p.Phe208Argfs*51) in OPN1LW were detected in two other families with X-linked high myopia. The unique haplotype cosegregated with high myopia in the two families, with a maximum LOD score of 3.34 and 2.31 at theta = 0. OPN1LW with the variants in these families was the first gene in the red-green gene array and was not present in 247 male controls. Reevaluation of the clinical data in both families with the unique haplotype suggested nonsyndromic high myopia., CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the findings that unique variants in OPN1LW are responsible for both syndromic and nonsyndromic X-linked high myopia mapped to MYP1.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the refractive outcomes of small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) in high-myopic patients with those of mild- to moderate-myopic patients., METHODS: This study included 183 eyes of 92 myopic patients treated with SMILE using a VisuMax 500-kHz femtosecond laser. Treated eyes were divided into two groups, according to the preoperative spherical equivalent (SE): mild to moderate myopia (A group, <-6.0 D) and high myopia (B group, >= - 6.0 D). Follow-up visits were at 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The outcome measures included uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), best-corrected distance visual acuity (BDVA), postoperative SE, efficacy index, safety index, and predictability., RESULTS: Preoperative SE was -5.05 +/- 0.71 D in the A group and -7.67 +/- 1.01 D in the B group. No differences were observed between -0.13 +/- 0.38 D in the A group and -0.24 +/- 0.35 D in the B group 12 months postoperatively (p = 0.18). At 12 months postoperatively, 93.1 % and 76.8 % had an UDVA of 20/20 or better in the A and B groups, respectively. In the A group, 87.9 % and 96.6 % were within +/- 0.5 D and +/- 1.0 D, respectively, of the intended correction; in the B group, 88.0 % and 97.6 % were within +/- 0.5 D and +/- 1.0 D, respectively. The efficacy index was 1.04 +/- 0.19 in the A group and 0.99 +/- 0.19 in the B group. The safety index was 1.27 +/- 0.17 for the A group and 1.24 +/- 0.17 for the B group. The efficacy and safety index were not significantly different between the two groups 12 months postoperatively (p = 0.141 and p = 0.307, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that SMILE is effective and safe for correcting high myopia, as well as mild to moderate myopia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and the predictive factors associated with the need for retreatment and long-term visual outcome after intravitreal bevacizumab for myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)., METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 93 eyes with subfoveal or juxtafoveal myopic CNV treated initially with either 3-monthly or single intravitreal bevacizumab injections followed by pro re nata retreatment. The efficacy was evaluated by the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) during follow-up visits. Backward stepwise multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the potential predictive factors on final BCVA, change in BCVA, and number of injections. Multiple logistic regression was performed to evaluate the potential predictive factors for retreatment., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 25.12 +/- 11.18 (SD) months. The mean logMAR BCVA at baseline was 0.72 +/- 0.58 logMAR (20/100 Snellen equivalent) and was maintained at 0.39 +/- 0.46 logMAR (20/50 Snellen equivalent) at the last follow-up (P < 0.001). The mean number of injections was 3.53 +/- 1.70 (range, 3-10), and a total of 25 eyes (26.9%) received retreatment. Patients who received single loading injection had significantly lower mean total number of injections (1.50 +/- 0.73 vs. 3.96 +/- 1.53). Both subfoveal and juxtafoveal myopic CNV eyes had significant improvement in BCVA (0.28 +/- 0.43 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.32 [20/40 vs 20/30 Snellen equivalent], P = 0.506), and juxtafoveal myopic CNV eyes had significantly better BCVA at baseline and at the last follow-up than the subfoveal group. Treatment-naive eyes had significant improvement from baseline BCVA, and the amount of improvement was significantly more than those who received previous photodynamic therapy (0.31 +/- 0.43 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.11 [20/40 vs 20/25 Snellen equivalent], P < 0.001). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis showed that the baseline CNV size (P < 0.05), baseline BCVA (P < 0.001), and duration of symptoms (P < 0.05) were significant predictive factors for final BCVA, and BCVA improvement. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified that CNV size (P = 0.014) and follow-up duration (P = 0.017) were significant predictive factors for retreatment. No significant association was found for number of injections., CONCLUSION: Intravitreal bevacizumab seems to be an effective treatment for both subfoveal and juxtafoveal myopic CNV in the long term. Patients presented with shorter duration of symptoms and smaller CNV size before treatment as significant prognostic factors that predict better visual outcome. Eyes with longer follow-up duration and larger baseline CNV size may have higher risk for retreatment.

N2  - PURPOSE: To study the current prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness in an adult Chinese population., DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study., PARTICIPANTS: We used a random cluster sampling method and evaluated 10 234 eligible subjects >=45 years old (response rate, 78.1%) in the Taizhou Eye Study., METHODS: Examinations were performed from July 2012 through December 2013. Participants underwent a detailed examination, including uncorrected visual acuity, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure, axial length, slit-lamp, and fundus examinations to evaluate the prevalence and primary causes of visual impairment (VI)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We defined low vision and blindness according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (low vision: BCVA, <20/63->=20/400; blindness: BCVA, <20/400 in the better eye) and United States criteria (low vision: BCVA, <20/40->=20/200; blindness: BCVA, <20/200 in the better eye)., RESULTS: Using the WHO BCVA criteria, the standardized prevalence of bilateral low vision and blindness were 5.1% and 1.0%, respectively. Using the United States BCVA criteria, the standardized prevalence were 12.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Using the WHO criteria, the primary causes of bilateral low vision and blindness were cataract (59.1% and 48.5%, respectively), myopic macular degeneration (17.6% and 17.2%, respectively), and age-related macular degeneration (11.6% and 10.1%, respectively). The primary causes of monocular low vision were cataract (55.6%), age-related macular degeneration (12.6%), and myopic macular degeneration (8.9%), whereas those of monocular blindness were cataract (46.8%), atrophy of eyeball or prosthetic eye (10.2%), and cornea opacity (7.3%). A further analysis revealed that in adults 45-59 years old, myopic macular degeneration (59.6% and 27.2%, respectively) and cataract (13.8% and 23.4%, respectively) were the leading causes of bilateral and monocular VI. In adults >=60 years old, cataract (66.8% and 61.2%, respectively) and age-related macular degeneration (12.6% and 11.8%, respectively) were the primary causes of bilateral and monocular VI., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of low vision and blindness in Chinese adults remains a severe public health problem. In the Taizhou Eye Study, cataract was the leading cause of low vision and blindness. Myopic macular degeneration and cataract were the primary causes of VI in adults 45-59 years and >=60 years old, respectively. Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this contribution is to report our functional results on the efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab for submacular choroidal neovessels (CNV) in high myopia, and to compare the roles of optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography and visual acuity changes in the treatment decision prior to each injection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study performed in Jules Gonin Eye Hospital. It included all patients with myopic CNV treated with intravitreal ranibizumab injections with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. After an induction dosing from 1 to 3 injections, the follow-up was based on a pro re nata regimen. Ophthalmic evaluation, best corrected visual acuity, and OCT were done at each visit, and fluorescein angiography at baseline and if neovascular activity was suspected. Retreatment criteria included metamorphopsia, visual loss of >=5 ETDRS letters, any fluid on OCT and/or leakage on fluorescein angiography., RESULTS: 24 eyes were included in the study. Mean follow-up was 49 months. Mean visual acuity improved significantly from 62.8+/-13.8 letters at baseline to 72.8+/-12.9 letters at last follow-up visit (p=0.001). The mean number of injections was 2.2 in the first year and below 1 for the following years. The sensitivities of fluorescein angiography, SD OCT, and visual acuity loss>=5 letters were 62.6%, 51.4%, and 40%, respectively. The fluorescein angiography showed a significantly higher sensitivity in treatment decision than OCT (p=0.007)., CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that ranibizumab injections provide a significant long-term visual benefit in myopic CNV with a small number of injections. Fluorescein angiography has a preponderant role in the treatment decision of active myopic CNV. Copyright Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

N2  - Choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM) associated with pathological myopia (PM) can result in significant vision loss and legal blindness. These membranes usually occur subfoveally and are a major complication of PM, developing in approximately 5-10% of such eyes. PM is the second most common cause of choroidal neovascularization after age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and accounts for nearly 60% of CNVM cases in patients younger than age 50. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A has been implicated as the major angiogenic stimulus responsible for choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD and several major studies have proved the benefits of anti-VEGF treatment for AMD-related CNVM. Benefits have also been observed in a number of prospective and retrospective studies evaluating PM CNVM. Despite the small differences in molecular properties of ranibizumab and bevacizumab, both drugs showed similar therapeutic effects for CNVM associated with PM. Many studies also highlighted that patient age, previous photodynamic therapy treatment, axial length, and visual acuity prior to treatment may affect treatment prognosis. Although there is a paucity of large randomized controlled trials, this systematic review highlights the large numbers of individual trials that demonstrate a significant improvement in VA. The inferior long-term results of alternative therapies, combined with an excellent safety profile from anti-VEGF treatment, make anti-VEGF the current recommended first-line therapy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical treatment effects of orthokeratology to slow the progression of myopia., METHODS: Several well-designed controlled studies have investigated the effects of orthokeratology in school-aged children. We conducted this meta-analysis to better evaluate the existing evidence. Relevant studies were identified in the Medline and Embase database without language limitations. The main outcomes included axial length and vitreous chamber depth reported as the mean +/- standard deviation. The results were pooled and assessed with a fixed-effects model analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to geographical location and study design., RESULTS: Of the seven eligible studies, all reported axial length changes after 2 years, while two studies reported vitreous chamber depth changes. The pooled estimates indicated that change in axial length in the ortho-k group was 0.27 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22, 0.32) less than the control group. Myopic progression was reduced by approximately 45%. The combined results revealed that the difference in vitreous chamber depth between the two groups was 0.22 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14, 0.31). None of the studies reported severe adverse events., CONCLUSION: The overall findings suggest that ortho-k can slow myopia progression in school-aged children.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the repercussions of peripapillary detachment on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurements in patients with highly myopic eyes., METHODS: A total of 244 highly myopic eyes underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination that included optical coherence tomography (OCT) to analyze the peripapillary retina and RNFL thickness. Based on the OCT findings, patients were grouped as follows: group A: eyes with a peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation (PIC); group B: eyes with a peripapillary neurosensory retinal detachment (PNRD), and group C: eyes without a peripapillary detachment., RESULTS: The OCT scans identified a peripapillary detachment in 42 eyes (17.21%). Out of these 42 eyes, 22 showed PIC (52.38%; group A) and 20 had a PNRD (47.62%; group B). The average overall RNFL thickness in groups A, B and C was 74.11 +/- 10.88, 88.26 +/- 25.72 and 72.75 +/- 16.24 mum, respectively (ANOVA test, p = 0.00)., CONCLUSION: Eyes with a PNRD had a significantly greater average RFNL thickness than those without peripapillary detachment in pathologic myopia due to a misidentification of the outer profile of the RFNL. This fact makes the interpretation of RNFL thickness in highly myopic eyes more challenging.

N2  - To review the literature on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic imaging, natural history, management, therapeutic approaches, and prognosis of myopic foveoschisis. A systematic Pubmed search was conducted using search terms: myopia, myopic, staphyloma, foveoschisis, and myopic foveoschisis. The evidence base for each section was organised and reviewed. Where possible an authors' interpretation or conclusion is provided for each section. The term myopic foveoschisis was first coined in 1999. It is associated with posterior staphyloma in high myopia, and is often asymptomatic initially but progresses slowly, leading to loss of central vision from foveal detachment or macular hole formation. Optical coherence tomography is used to diagnose the splitting of the neural retina into a thicker inner layer and a thinner outer layer, but compound variants of the splits have been identified. Vitrectomy with an internal limiting membrane peel and gas tamponade is the preferred approach for eyes with vision decline. There has been a surge of new information on myopic foveoschisis. Advances in optical coherence tomography will continually improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of retinal splitting, and the mechanisms that lead to macular damage and visual loss. Currently, there is a good level of consensus that surgical intervention should be considered when there is progressive visual decline from myopic foveoschisis.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the accuracy of formulas and methods for calculating the intraocular lens (IOL) power for eyes with an axial length (AL) greater than 26.0 mm., SETTING: Ein-Tal Eye Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel., DESIGN: Retrospective case series., METHODS: The postoperative refraction results in myopic eyes with an AL over 26.0 mm were compared with the predicted refractions calculated using standard formulas (Holladay 1, SRK/T, Hoffer Q, and Haigis) with optical IOL constants, User Group for Laser Interference Biometry constants, and an AL-adjustment method and using new-generation formulas (Barrett Universal II, Holladay 2, and Olsen)., RESULTS: In 76 (71.7%) of 106 eyes, the IOL was 6.0 diopters (D) or more (Group A) and in 30 eyes (28.3%) was less than 6.0 D (Group B). In Group A, the SRK/T, Hoffer Q, Haigis, Barrett Universal II, Holladay 2, and Olsen methods met the benchmark criteria of having a prediction error of +/-0.5 D in at least 71.0% of eyes and +/-1.0 D in 93.0% of eyes. In Group B, only the Barrett Universal II formula and the Holladay 1 and Haigis formulas using the AL-adjusted method met those criteria., CONCLUSION: When selecting IOLs for high and extreme myopia, choosing appropriate formulas and methods can yield accurate refractive results that meet benchmark criteria., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the topography and predictors of peripapillary choroidal thickness (PPCT) in highly myopic eyes of young, healthy, Asian subjects., METHODS: A total of 870 young male subjects aged 21.63 +/- 1.15 years were recruited from the Singapore military. Choroidal imaging was performed using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Peripapillary choroidal thickness was manually measured at eight locations around the optic disc., RESULTS: We analyzed 448 subjects with high myopia (defined as spherical equivalent [SE] worse than -6.0 diopters [D]) and 116 with emmetropia (SE > -0.5 and < 0.5 D). The mean SE was -8.52 +/- 1.20 D for the high-myopic group, and 0.11 +/- 0.24 D for the emmetropic group. The mean peripapillary choroid was significantly thinner (142.62 +/- 43.84 mum) in high myopes compared with emmetropes (181.90 +/- 46.43 mum, P < 0.001). Likewise, PPCT showed further decrease with increase in degree of myopic refractive error. Distribution of PPCT showed a markedly different pattern in high-myopic eyes (thickest superiorly) and emmetropic eyes (thickest temporally). However, peripapillary choroid in both the groups was thinnest at the inferior location. Among the ocular factors studied, axial length, IOP, presence of posterior staphyloma, and chorioretinal atrophy were the factors significantly associated with PPCT., CONCLUSIONS: Highly myopic eyes have significantly thinner peripapillary choroid and showed different distribution of thickness, compared with emmetropes. Axial length, IOP, and presence of posterior staphyloma and chorioretinal atrophy significantly influence PPCT and should be taken into consideration during clinical interpretation of PPCT measurement.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the ocular and neurologic manifestations, and to identify the causative mutation in a family with an excavated optic disc anomaly, high myopia, enlarged axial lengths, and abnormal visual evoked response (VER)., DESIGN: Prospective observational case series with whole exome sequencing., METHODS: Institutional study of 8 family members from 3 generations. Clinical examination included visual field examination, optical coherence tomography, axial length measurement, audiometry, visual evoked response (VER), orbital and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and renal ultrasound. DNA was analyzed by whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. Main outcome measures were clinical and radiological findings, and DNA sequence data., RESULTS: Three affected family members, a father and his 2 daughters, were examined. The parents and siblings of the father were healthy. Affected individuals presented with excavated optic discs, high myopia (-1.00 to -16.00 diopters), and increased axial lengths. Reduced visual acuity (0.05-0.8) and decreased sensitivity on visual field examination were observed. VER revealed prolonged latency times. Affected eyes appeared ovoid on MRI and the father had thin optic nerves. Exome sequencing revealed that the father was heterozygous for a de novo 5 bp deletion in MYCBP2, c.5906_5910del; p.Glu1969Valfs*26. The same mutation was found in his 2 affected daughters, but not in his parents or siblings, or in public databases., CONCLUSION: We describe a distinct excavated optic disc anomaly associated with high myopia and increased axial length. The condition appears to follow an autosomal dominant pattern and segregate with a deletion in MYCBP2. We suggest naming this entity high myopia-excavated optic disc anomaly.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess intra/inter-observer agreement, and diagnostic capabilities of a color fundus photograph, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in making a diagnosis of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two masked observers evaluated FFA and SD-OCT images to identify the presence of myopic CNV in 80 high-myopic eyes of 57 patients. A third masked observer identified CNV on a color fundus photo. Presence of myopic CNV on a fundus photo was defined as presence of subretinal hemorrhage, thickening of the retina and/or visible membrane at the macula. Presence of myopic CNV on FFA was defined as hyperfluorescence in the early phase with increase in intensity and size in the late phase; presence of a large irregular lesion; and hypofluorsescence due to subretinal hemorrhage. Myopic CNV on SD-OCT was defined as the hyper-reflective lesion with or without intraretinal fluid or subretinal fluid with retinal thickening., RESULTS: Intraobserver repeatability on FFA and SD-OCT was 0.54 and 0.44, respectively. Agreement (kappa) between FFA and SD-OCT was 0.38 and 0.3, respectively. Among 34 eyes, which had the presence of CNV on a color fundus photo, CNV was diagnosed in 18 (53%) eyes on FFA and in 20 (58.8%) eyes on SD-OCT. Sensitivity and specificity of FFA was 47 and 80.4%, respectively, and that of SD-OCT was 58.8 and 86.9%, respectively., CONCLUSION: Repeatability and reproducibility for diagnosis of myopic CNV was better with FFA compared with SD-OCT; however, agreement is very poor between FFA and SD-OCT. SD-OCT is comparatively a better tool to rule out presence of myopic CNV.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the morphologic changes along the edge of posterior staphyloma in highly myopic eyes with patchy chorioretinal atrophy and to identify the relationship between retinal thinning and the visual field (VF) defects found in these eyes., DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series., METHODS: Twenty eyes (17 patients) with pathologic myopia (myopic refractive error >= 8 diopters or an axial length >= 26.5 mm) and patchy atrophy along the staphyloma edge were analyzed retrospectively. The VFs were obtained by Goldmann kinetic perimetry., RESULTS: In the area of patchy atrophy, the inner retinal tissue was very thin or completely absent. Any remnants of the retinal tissue appeared to be adherent to the layer of large choroidal vessels or to the sclera. The mean thickness of the retina at its thinnest point in the area was 51.6 +/- 29.0 mum in 20 eyes. The retina was thinner than 50 mum at its thinnest point in 12 (60.0%) of the 20 eyes, and the mean retinal thickness at its thinnest point in these 12 eyes was 32.1 +/- 16.0 mum (range, 4 to 49 mum). Nineteen eyes (VF of 1 eye was not determined) had very similar VF findings by Goldmann perimetry, that is, a defect of the sector corresponding to the course of retinal nerve fiber over the patchy atrophy., CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the thickness of not only the outer retina, but also of most of the inner retina, including the nerve fiber layer, is significantly thinner at the staphyloma edge. Such damage to the inner retina along the staphyloma edge causes the VF defects in highly myopic eyes. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the morphological changes before and after the formation of a full-thickness macular hole (MH) in highly myopic eyes., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational case series. From 2006 to 2013, clinical records of patients with MH and high myopia who had optical coherence tomography (OCT) before the development of MH were reviewed. All patients had been followed for more than 1 year since MH formation to observe the morphological changes., RESULTS: Twenty-six eyes of 24 patients were enrolled. The initial OCT images could be classified into four types: (1) normal foveal depression with abnormal vitreo-retinal relationship (eight cases), (2) macular schisis without detachment (six cases), (3) macular schisis with concomitant/subsequent detachment (nine cases), and (4) macular atrophy with underlying/adjacent scar (three cases). After MH formation, one case in type 1 and one case in type 4 group developed retinal detachment (RD). In type 2 group, four cases developed RD at the same time of MH formation. The preexisting detachment in type 3 group extended in eight cases and improved in one case. Among all the cases, 14 eyes received vitrectomy and 7 eyes received gas injection. MH sealed in nine eyes after vitrectomy and four eyes by gas injection., CONCLUSION: The study revealed four pathways of MH formation in highly myopic eyes. MH from macular schisis tended to be associated with detachment. However, the evolution and the results of surgical intervention were not always predictable.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of the present review was to summarize the evidence implicating the association between myopia and glaucoma, the possible underlying mechanisms for this relation, and the controversies surrounding detection of glaucomatous changes in coexisting myopia., RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous studies have shown that increasing categories of myopia are associated with a higher risk for optic neuropathy and glaucoma-like visual field defects. Recently, some high-resolution imaging modalities have been developed that aid further detection of the microanatomical changes of the optic nerve head and thus may provide a new insight to explain the association between myopia and glaucoma. Although the highly myopic eye usually shows many structural and functional defects that are difficult to distinguish from those caused by glaucoma, some new methods have been introduced to better differentiate between these changes., SUMMARY: The interaction of myopia with glaucoma risk remains complex, largely because of the retinal and nerve fiber layer damage that occurs in myopia alone. Whether to treat for glaucoma relies on the suspicion level of the clinician who must consider other risk factors for vision loss. Ultimately, it is the progression of glaucoma-like findings that determines whether a myopic patient has glaucoma.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the distribution of choroidal thickness (CT) and ocular factors associated with CT in high myopic eyes in comparison with emmetropic eyes of young healthy adults., METHODS: A case-control study of 648 young, male subjects, including 520 high myopes and 128 emmetropes. Choroidal imaging was performed using enhanced depth imaging spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Images were postprocessed using adaptive compensation for quality enhancement. CT was measured at nine locations, including subfovea and 1.5 and 3 mm nasal, temporal, superior and inferior to fovea., RESULTS: The CT at the subfovea was significantly thinner (mean +/- standard error: 225.87 +/- 5.51 mum) for high myopes compared to emmetropes (375.15 +/- 6.58 mum, p < 0.001). Likewise, CT in high myopic group was significantly thinner than emmetropic control group at all locations (p for trend <0.001 for all locations). Distribution of CT showed a markedly different pattern in high myopic eyes (thickest superiorly at 3 mm, 265.97 +/- 5.97 mum) and emmetropic eyes (thickest subfoveally, 375.15 +/- 6.58 mum). Choroid was thinnest at nasal 3 mm location in both the myopic (108.85 +/- 3.97 mum) and emmetropic (238.25 +/- 6.72 mum) groups. Among the ocular factors studied, axial length, posterior staphyloma and chorio-retinal atrophy were the significant predictors of CT., CONCLUSIONS: Highly myopic eyes have significantly thinner choroid and showed different distribution pattern, compared to emmetropes. Axial length, posterior staphyloma and chorio-retinal atrophy are the strongest determinants of CT. Copyright © 2014 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Many subjects, especially highly educated subjects, are increasingly exposed to computer use. This exposure might represent an explanation for the growing rates of myopia., METHODS: We assessed 17,217 Spanish university graduates from the SUN project, an open-recruitment cohort. Their mean age was 38.5 years (SD 12.1), and their mean time of exposure to computers was 14.3h/week (SD 14.6). We estimated multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the risk of myopia development and/or progression (>=0.5 diopters) according to baseline exposure to computer and to changes in exposure., RESULTS: The age and sex-adjusted OR comparing >40 h/week of exposure versus<10h/week was 1.34 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.60). This association remained essentially unchanged after additional adjustments. Comparing participants who increased their exposure to computers, versus those with no change, the age and sex-adjusted OR was 1.49 (1.34-1.66). This result was unchanged after additional adjustments., CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first large longitudinal assessment in young adults, showing that exposure to computer use is associated with myopia development or progression in a cohort of Spanish university graduates. Further studies are needed to confirm these epidemiological findings. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term outcomes of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for high myopia with or without astigmatism., SETTING: Vissum Instituto Oftalmologico de Alicante and Miguel Hernandez University, Alicante, Spain., DESIGN: Retrospective-prospective case series., METHODS: Laser in situ keratomileusis was performed using the Visx 20/20 excimer laser. The minimum follow-up was 15 years. The main outcome measures were uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities, manifest refraction, and corneal topography., RESULTS: This study included 40 patients (40 eyes) with a mean age of 51.08 years +/- 6.67 (SD) (range 41 to 60 years) with high myopia (-6.00 to -18.00 diopters [D]). At 15 years, the safety index was 1.23 and the efficacy index, 0.95. During the follow-up, a significant increase in the dioptric power of all keratometric variables was detected (P<=.028, Friedman test), the most notable increase occurring between 3 months and 1 year (P<=.005). At 15 years, 46.15% of the eyes were within +/-1.00 D of the attempted spherical equivalent and 64.10% were within +/-2.00 D. The UDVA at 15 years was 20/25 or better in 43.59% of eyes and 20/40 or better in 64.10% of eyes. The postoperative CDVA was significantly better than preoperatively (P<.001). The postoperative complications were minor except in 1 eye in which ectasia occurred., CONCLUSIONS: Laser in situ keratomileusis for high myopia was safe over the long term. However, significant myopic regression with time was detected. Low preoperative pachymetry and low residual stromal bed were predictors of keratometric regression., FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of ranibizumab for the treatment of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a clinical setting., METHODS: This was a retrospective, monocentric, noncomparative analysis of 51 eyes of 51 patients with naive juxtafoveal or subfoveal myopic CNV treated with intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) on a pro re nata basis for at least 24 months. The patients' demographic data were recorded, including the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measured with an ETDRS chart, location of the CNV, grade of myopic changes, central foveal thickness (CFT), and number of administered IVR. Outcome measures were to determine the changes in BCVA, identify the factors influencing the visual outcome, compare the best visual gain obtained for each treated eye with the final visual gain, and identify the cause of the relative decline in the visual acuity, when present., RESULTS: BCVA improved from 58.7 +/- 19.0 letters at baseline to 66.3 +/- 16.2 letters at the final visit (P = 0.001; mean visual gain: +7.6 +/- 15.6 letters). Multivariate analysis did not identify any correlation between the visual gain and age, sex, grade of myopic fundus changes, CNV location, or initial protocol. The mean IVR number was 3.5 +/- 2.8 injections (range 1-12; median 3) for a mean follow-up of 39.3 +/- 11.3 months (range 24-69). Twenty-one eyes experienced a relative decline in BCVA during the follow-up, which was attributable in 16 cases to myopic atrophic changes., CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal ranibizumab resulted in long-term efficacy in the treatment of myopic CNV. However, some eyes may present a long-term relative decline in their initial visual gain.

N2  - PURPOSE: Comparison of visual acuity, refractive, and wavefront outcomes associated with optimized prolate ablation (OPA) and optical path difference custom aspheric treatment (OPDCAT) algorithms for correction of myopia exceeding 8 diopters (D)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to have photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) with OPA (n=32) or OPDCAT (n=21) algorithms. Visual acuity, manifest refraction, ocular and corneal higher-order aberrations, corneal asphericity, modulated-transfer function, and point-spread function were compared 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively., RESULTS: Mean manifest-refraction spherical equivalents at 6 months were -0.24 D in both groups. All patients in both groups had an uncorrected-distance visual acuity of 20/20 or better. Predictability (+/-1 D from intended refraction) at 6 months was 94% in the OPA group, and in the OPDCAT group it was 86%. The OPA group had less induced corneal and ocular spherical aberrations (SAs) than the OPDCAT group. Postoperative corneal asphericity change was lowest in the OPA group. Both the groups exhibited significantly-improved AreaRatio-Total value and insignificantly deteriorated AreaRatio-HO value throughout the postoperative period. The OPA group had significantly-higher AreaRatio-Total compared with OPDCAT group at both 1 and 6 months after the operation. Six months after surgery, the Strehl ratio had decreased in both groups, and there was no significant difference between the groups., CONCLUSION: The OPA algorithms yielded higher-objective visual quality and predictability, induced less corneal and ocular SAs, and preserved more preoperative-corneal asphericity than the OPDCAT algorithms.

T1  - Clinical prediction of the need for interventions for the control of myopia.
A1  - McMonnies, Charles W
Y1  - 2015//
Y2  - 20141023//
N2  - The prevalence of myopia is increasing in Western populations but in East Asian countries, it is increasing to epidemic levels, where there are also markedly increased rates of progression to pathological myopia. Measures to more effectively control the development and progression of myopia are urgently needed. Notwithstanding a large volume of research, especially regarding the different mechanisms for the development of myopia and the efficacy of particular methods of intervention, there is still a great need and scope for improvements in clinical efforts to prevent and/or control myopic progression. Too often clinical efforts may involve only one method of intervention; however, the heterogenous nature of myopia suggests that clinical intervention may be more successful when interventions are employed in combination. The decision to prescribe interventions for the control of myopia in children, especially prior to onset, may be better framed by a comprehensive estimation of the degree of risk for the development and/or progression of myopia. For example, rather than ascribing equal weight to any degree of parental myopia, more accurate estimates may be obtained, if risk is judged to increase with the degree of parental myopia and the extent of any associated degenerative pathology. Risk estimates may be limited to broad mild, moderate and severe classifications due to lack of accurate weighting of risk factors. Nevertheless, comprehensive assessment of risk factors appears likely to better inform a prognosis and discussions with parents. Consideration of numerous environmental influences, for example, such as continuity and intensity of near work and time spent outdoors, may contribute to better risk estimation. Family-based practice appears to be ideally suited for risk estimation and the clinical application of approaches to control myopia. A proactive approach to estimating risk of developing myopia prior to its onset may be beneficial. Earlier implementation of interventions to control myopia could significantly reduce the chance of progression to pathological myopia. Copyright © 2014 Optometry Australia.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the association of both aqueous and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and macular choroidal thickness in high myopia., MATERIALS AND METHODS: VEGF concentrations were measured in aqueous and serum samples via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared between high myopia (n = 36 eyes, 36 patients) and normal control (n = 42 eyes, 42 patients) eyes. Macular choroidal thickness, the distance from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to the scleral interface, was determined via enhanced depth-imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT). Axial length was measured using the intraocular (IOL) lens Master., RESULTS: Aqueous levels of VEGF from high myopia patients were significantly lower compared with those from control persons (61.4 +/- 27.6 versus 122.6 +/- 52.4 pg/ml; p < 0.001), respectively. Macular choroidal thickness of high myopia patients was significantly lower compared with that of control persons (111.1 +/- 45.0 versus 230.6 +/- 81.8 mum; p < 0.001), respectively. Aqueous levels of VEGF were significantly associated with both macular choroidal thickness (R(2)= 0.641; p < 0.001) and axial length (R(2)= 0.679; p < 0.001) in high myopia patients. In addition, there was a significantly negative correlation between macular choroidal thickness and axial length (R(2)= 0.69; p < 0.001). However, no correlation between serum VEGF and either macular choroidal thickness or axial length was detected in high myopia patients (R(2)= 0.009; p = 0.59; R(2)= 0.00002; p = 0.981)., CONCLUSIONS: Macular choroidal thickness was significantly correlated with aqueous, but not serum, levels of VEGF in highly myopic eyes. Macular choroidal thickness may be of predictive value for identifying aqueous VEGF levels in high myopia patients and may, thus, be a useful prognostic modality.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency and causes of visual impairment in relation to refractive error., DESIGN: Population-based cohort study., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6597 participants from Rotterdam Study I (baseline and 4 follow-up examinations) and 2579 participants from Rotterdam Study II (baseline and 2 follow-up examinations), all 55 years or older, were included., METHODS: Participants underwent an extensive ophthalmic examination, including best-corrected visual acuity and objective refraction, fundus photography, visual field perimetry, and optical coherence tomography imaging of macula and optic disc. We calculated cumulative risks and odds ratios of visual impairment for various refractive error categories and determined causes by using all screening information as well as medical records., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Unilateral and bilateral low vision (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria, VA < 0.3 and VA >= 0.05; United States (US) criteria, VA < 0.5 and VA >= 0.1) and blindness (WHO criteria, VA < 0.05; US criteria, VA < 0.1)., RESULTS: Cumulative risks of visual impairment ranged from virtually 0 in all refractive error categories at 55 years of age to 9.5% (standard error, 0.01) for emmetropia and 15.3% (standard error, 0.06) for high hyperopia to 33.7% (standard error, 0.08) for high myopia at 85 years of age. The major causes of visual impairment in highly hyperopic persons were age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract, and combined causes (each 25%); in highly myopic persons, the major cause was myopic macular degeneration (38.9%). The major causes of visual impairment for the other refractive error categories were AMD and cataract. Compared with those with emmetropia, those with high myopia had a significantly increased lifetime risk of visual impairment; those with -6 diopters (D) or less and -10 D or more had an odds ratio (OR) risk of 3.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.2) of visual impairment; those with less than -10 D had an OR of 22.0 (95% CI, 9.2-52.6)., CONCLUSIONS: Of all refractive errors, high myopia has the most severe visual consequences. Irreversible macular pathologic features are the most common cause of visual impairment in this group. Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the results of fundus autofluorescence and axial length as prognostic factors for surgical outcome of macular hole retinal detachment in high myopic patients., METHODS: This is a retrospective, interventional, nonrandomized study. Patients were treated with posterior vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling, and silicone oil tamponade. Best-corrected visual acuity, axial length, fundus autofluorescence, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography images were obtained., RESULTS: Fifteen eyes from 15 patients (mean age, 69.4 years) were evaluated. The mean refractive error was -19 diopters, and the mean axial length was 29.9 mm. The mean best-corrected visual acuity (logMAR) improved from 2.17 to 1.42 (P = 0.02) after a mean follow-up of 19.3 months. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans showed retinal detachment resolution in 13 eyes (86.6%) and macular hole closure in 9 eyes (60%). Fundus autofluorescence showed macular hypoautofluorescence with foveal involvement (mean area of 9.7 mm2) in 10 eyes (66.6%). Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity was significantly worse in these eyes (P = 0.009). Axial length >30 mm was found in the 2 cases with recurrent retinal detachment and in 4 of the 6 cases without macular hole closure (66.6%)., CONCLUSION: Macular hole retinal detachment in high myopic patients can be successfully treated with vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling, and silicone oil. Axial length >30 mm and macular hypoautofluorescence with foveal involvement seem to be prognostic factors for a worse anatomical and visual outcome.

N2  - PURPOSE: To compare the long-term outcomes of simple hemorrhage (SH) without any treatments and myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) treated with intravitreal bevacizumab in highly myopic eyes., METHODS: Twenty eyes (17 patients) with SH and 28 eyes (27 patients) with mCNV were included. We retrospectively evaluated the refractive error, axial length, age, best-corrected visual acuity, and the integrity of photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment junction and compared the two groups., RESULTS: The mean patient age was 41.6 +/- 11.2 years, the mean refractive error -12.7 +/- 3.57 diopters, and the mean axial length was 29.64 +/- 1.42 mm. Patients in the SH group were significantly (P < 0.001) younger than those in the mCNV group (34.8 vs. 46.5 years, respectively). There were no significant differences in other parameters between the groups. Compared with baseline, the best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly (P < 0.01) at 12 months in both groups. The change in vision at 12 months in the SH group was significantly (P < 0.05) better than that in the mCNV group, although there were no significant differences at 3 months or 6 months. The final integrity of photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment junction was significantly associated with the final best-corrected visual acuity (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Eyes with SH had a more favorable visual prognosis compared with eyes with mCNV treated with intravitreal bevacizumab. The differential diagnosis of these pathologies is important.

N2  - AIM: To assess the clinical outcomes following the use of toric implantable collamer lenses (toric ICL, STAAR Surgical) for the correction of high myopic astigmatism with keratoconus., METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated 21 eyes of 11 patients with spherical equivalents of -9.70+/-2.33 D (mean+/-SD) and astigmatism of -3.21+/-1.56 D who underwent toric ICL implantation for keratoconus. Preoperatively, and at 1, 3 and 6 months and 1, 2 and 3 years postoperatively, we assessed the safety, efficacy, predictability, stability and adverse events of the surgery., RESULTS: The logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and the logMAR corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were -0.06+/-0.11 and -0.12+/-0.09, respectively, at 3 years postoperatively. At 3 years, 67% and 86% of the eyes were within +/-0.5 and +/-1.0 D, respectively, of the targeted correction. Manifest refraction changes of 0.04+/-0.33 D occurred from 1 month to 3 years postoperatively. No significant change in manifest refraction (analysis of variance, p=0.989) or keratometry (p=0.951), or vision-threatening complications occurred during the observation period., CONCLUSIONS: Toric ICL implantation is beneficial according to measures of safety, efficacy, predictability and stability for the correction of refractive errors for keratoconus during a 3-year observation period. The disease did not progress even in the late-postoperative period, suggesting the viability of this procedure as a surgical option for the treatment of such eyes.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of bevacizumab in the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathological myopia., METHODS: In this retrospective single-center non-comparative study the medical records of 29 eyes from 29 patients with naive CNV secondary to high myopia and at least 42 months of follow up were reviewed. All eyes received a loading dose of one intravitreal injection per month for two consecutive months and were retreated on an as-needed basis during the course of follow up. The main outcome measures were post-treatment ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and visual stabilization over time. Stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors for visual acuity gain and final visual acuity outcome at 42 months., RESULTS: At 42 months of follow-up bevacizumab was associated with the maintenance of significant benefits in visual acuity compared to baseline. No adverse ocular or systemic effects from treatment were encountered. No statistically significant correlations were found between BCVA change and any of the quantitative variables. However, when final BCVA was taken as a dependent variable and CNV size and pre-treatment VA were included as predictors, a bivariate model was identified by stepwise regression which gave a 75 % of explained variance., CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab treatment was found to be efficacious in the treatment of myopic CNV, resulting in stable gains in visual acuity lasting at least 42 months, without any adverse ocular or general events. Myopic CNV size was identified as a significant prognostic factor.

N2  - Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) is a common vision-threatening complication of myopia and pathological myopia. Despite significant advances in understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis and natural history of myopic CNV, there is no standard definition of myopic CNV and its relationship to axial length and other myopic degenerative changes. Several treatments are available to ophthalmologists, but with the advent of new therapies there is a need for further consensus and clinical management recommendations. Verteporfin photodynamic therapy has been an established treatment for subfoveal myopic CNV for many years, but this treatment does not restore visual acuity and is associated with long-term chorioretinal atrophy. More recently, clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents in patients with myopic CNV have demonstrated substantial visual acuity gains and quality of life increases compared with photodynamic therapy. These enhanced outcomes provide updated evidence-based clinical management guidelines of myopic CNV, and increase the need for a generally accepted definition for myopic CNV. This review critically summarises the latest myopic CNV literature in the context of clinical experience and recommends a myopic CNV treatment algorithm.
